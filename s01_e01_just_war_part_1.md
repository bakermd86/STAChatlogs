>Captains log, Stardate 61062.5: While en-route to the Spora Nebula to begin our survey operations, we recieved an unusual subspace mesage. The inhabitents of the planet Osala requested Federation assistance to mediate a cease-fire talk between two warring factions.&#13;&#13;The Osalan civilization was once a thriving power in the sector, but more than 100 years of endless war between the Osalan Central Republic and the Northern Front has reduced their civilization nearly to ashes. They probably wouldn't have recognized a more modern vessel as being a Federation design, so at least that is one advantage the Lister has over the Akiras and Sovereigns of the fleet.&#13;&#13;We will be meeting with the representatives of both factions to begin negotiations today.<br />

>INTERIOR - Bridge: It has been several hours since Captain Baras and Counselor Murry began negotiations with the Osalans. Since then, the shouting and table pounding from the briefing room have gotten progressively louder.<br />

Commander Bachar: That's it, I need to know what is going on in there<br />
*Commander Bachar pipes the comms audio through to the bridge*<br />
Zox: I'm not sure how to say this, but the situation clearly skinks. <br />
**Skig: [ CONTROL  (11) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]&#10;[Focus: Emergency Repairs ]&#10;[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 3 momentum  [2d20 = 6]**<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Boosh.</font><br />
Telar Talis: The Northern Front still occupies the Rolvak valley. I refuse to tolerate a proposed border which leaves Republic territory in your hands!<br />
Utris Vixal: The Central Republic annexed the Rolvak Valley from our people!<br />
Telar Talis: It was undeveloped wilderness when my people tamed it, why should your people benefit from cities built with our sweat and blood!<br />
Utris Vixal: There are no cities left! It is nothing but ruins. Build on my people's land!<br />
>The delegates devolve into further shouting<br />

Captain Baras: Commander Murry... Any suggestions?<br />
Skig: Hmm... I notice the Alluvial Damper has reached the Mun Coefficient on the starboard nacelle, I'll just start a level 1 diagnostic on that to make sure we don't have to worry about an issue with expanding the Jool radians.<br />
Commander Bachar: Just do what you can to get the warp core back online, I don't like being stuck at impulse<br />
*Captain Baras looks very uncomfortable with the tone of the negotiations*<br />
*Zox 'monitors' the rooms around the delegations for disturbances.*<br />
*Hailey Murry speaks to Captain Baras on the side as the delegates shout*<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Focus: Espionage ]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum  [2d20 = 25]**<br />
Hailey Murry: It sounds like a situation where the two of them could actually work together to rebuild in that situation if they weren't so focused on their peoples' pride<br />
Hailey Murry: If we can find something substantial to distract them from the past, we can get them focused on the future<br />
Captain Baras: That is an excellent idea Murry. I... am not the most skilled at the &#34;diplomacy&#34; side of the captain's seat<br />
Captain Baras: Why don't we all calm down and think about the root of the problem. As the commander suggests, this may be an opportunity in disguise. Commander...<br />
*Captain Baras gestures to to Commander Murry to continue*<br />
Lt. Malat: Ok, it sounds like the captain is throwing in the towel. Anyone want to bet 1-week's holodeck time that they come to blows?<br />
Lt. Malat: Zox, you a betting man? Or.. Woman? Does your species have gender?<br />
**Zox:   [d6 = 2]**<br />
Lt. Malat: It wasn't in your file<br />
Zox: Not as you seem to practice it.<br />
**Skig: [ CONTROL  (11) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]&#10;[Focus: System Maintenance ]&#10;[Successes: 5] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 4 momentum  [3d20 = 13]**<br />
Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: Gender IS a strange concept. Why should your genital shape form the basis for your social divisions<br />
Zox: Generally, we don't try to egg each other on to certain behaviors, that's for the seasons.<br />
Hailey Murry: Gentlemen, please. I might suggest that this is an opportunity to solve two issues at once. The Northern Front could use the space to settle, while the Republic's economy is in a downturn. I would suggest working together to rebuild and resettle the valley. The increased economic activity and trade would help provide both a home for those in need and economic stimulation to provide for them as they settle. <br />
**Hailey Murry: [ INSIGHT  (12) +  CONN  (3)]&#10;[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 1 momentum  [2d20 = 9]**<br />
**Zox: [ REASON  (7) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Focus: Shipboard Tactical Systems ]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum  [2d20 = 20]**<br />
*Telar Talis and Utris Vixal sit back down and look at Commander Murry*<br />
Skig: Lt. Cmdr Viraseti, could you assist me with these sensor scan results?  I believe this is an unusual phenomenon external to the ship which is inhibiting our warp field.<br />
Telar Talis: That is... reasonable<br />
Utris Vixal: We could accept that compromise<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Tactical.</font><br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti looks at Skig's console*<br />
Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Interesting...<br />
Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: There is no obvious source of that warp field, it is almost as though the planet itself is emanating it...<br />
Captain Baras: Well, that is one issue resolved at least<br />
Captain Baras: Perhaps we should take a brief rest and get something to eat in the mess?<br />
Captain Baras: It has been a long morning<br />
Telar Talis: Agreed, I for one am eager to see the rest of this vessel<br />
*Captain Baras leads the delegates out of the briefing room and back onto the bridge*<br />
*Commander Bachar quickly cuts off the comms eavesdropping*<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 1]&#10;Success with 0 momentum  [2d20 = 35]**<br />
>Two security officers walk over to the briefing room door and stand ominously behind the delegates, looking threatening<br />

Skig: We could try moving out of range and see if the warp field re-estbalishes itself?<br />
Commander Bachar: Agreed. Malat, move us to a higher orbit<br />
*Skig obviously has a Tellarite accent for certain words.*<br />
*Zox has a bit of a hissssy fit in ordering some security personel.*<br />
**Skig: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (3)]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum  [2d20 = 31]**<br />
*Hailey Murry pulls the security officers back several steps to give them some breathing space, adjusting their positions so they're not looming menacingly so much as actually  standing guard*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Man, I sorta wish they had given them a triceratops head and then I could smash into things to challenge a klingon to Bat'leth.</font><br />
>Captain Baras suddenly vanishes into a flash of light while crossing the bridge to the turbolift<br />

Commander Bachar: Yellow Alert! Zox, raise shie...<br />
Skig: Commander, I do not think we should continue our ascent as the warp field suppression seems to be...<br />
>Before she can finish her order, Commander Bachar vanishes as well<br />

Skig: Zox, I believe she wanted you to raise Shields.<br />
Hailey Murry: The delegates!<br />
Zox: Shields up! Run a trace on all transporter beams!<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Maybe we should have established Chain of Command if both the Captain and XO vanished in a beam of light.</font><br />
**Hailey Murry: [ DARING  (11) +  COMMAND  (1)]&#10;[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]&#10;Failed on DC: 1  [2d20 = 34]**<br />
**Zox: [ DARING  (11) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]&#10;Failed on DC: 1  [2d20 = 36]**<br />
**Zox:   [d20 = 16]**<br />
>Commander Murry issues confusing orders to the security officers in the heat of the moment<br />

**Zox:   [d20 = 12]**<br />
>Zox runs a scan, but finds that there is no residual transporter energy at all<br />

*Hailey Murry gesticulates wildly to the two guards*<br />
Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: It isn't a transporter! Skig, the war...<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti vanishes mid-sentence*<br />
Zox: Leapin Lizards! What's happening?!<br />
Skig: There is no reason to panic Zox.<br />
Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: We believe the Lietenant Commander was attempting to say that the dissapearances are related to the warp interference<br />
Skig: Have you raised the shields? And were the shields up prior to Viraseti's disappearance?<br />
Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: The energy signature does not match a transporter, it matches a jump to warp<br />
Skig: That seems likely 11 and 10.<br />
Zox: The shields should be up now, and no they were not up in an attempt to show good will with the ambassators on board.<br />
Skig: Right, so bring the ship back to its original orbit to see if the warp field instability from the interference field generated by the planet stabilizes.<br />
Skig: Thank you Zox.<br />
Lt. Malat: Aye sir<br />
*Lt. Malat pilots the Lister back to its lower orbit*<br />
Hailey Murry: A jump to warp? Why are crewmen being jumped to warp? <br />
Skig: Murry, as the diplomatic one, can you ensure the safety of the diplomats and see to their disposition while we look into this situation?<br />
**Skig: [ REASON  (10) +  SCIENCE  (3)]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum  [2d20 = 21]**<br />
*Skig performs a sensor scan on the warp field to determine what is going on.*<br />
Skig: The field energy from the warp disturbance is returning to normal levels. I can form a supposition that whatever is controlling this warp inhibitor field wants us to remain in a lower orbit.<br />
Skig: Zox, can you perform an internal scan to see how many crew have disappeared from this warp-transporter situation?<br />
Zox: Aye-Aye.<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Focus: Shipboard Tactical Systems ]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum  [2d20 = 24]**<br />
Telar Talis: I am certain that this is some sort of Northern Front deception!<br />
Zox: 170 of the crew are missing, Skig.<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Skig has called a meeting of the remaining senior staff to investigate the warp field interference and the crew's dissapearance<br />

Skig: While nothing can be discounted, let us consider the high likelihood that neither of your peoples are capable of this level of technical sophistication.<br />
Skig: Thank you Zox.<br />
Utris Vixal: Hah! Sounds like hte unhigned accusations of the Central Republic!<br />
*Skig looks at the delegates.*<br />
>Utris and Telar nearly come to blows before the security officers separate them<br />

Zox: Murry, can you escort these two to the brig? I think the situation will get the best of them.<br />
Hailey Murry: Delegates, please. We'll get to the bottom of this in no time. This sort of circumstance can happen without any malefactors. Meanwhile, come with me and I'll arrange for some lunch. <br />
Skig: Sirs, while I can appreciate the fear of the unknown when presented unknown information, please consider whether your technical skills would be capable of the observed behavior.<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ PRESENCE  (8) +  CONN  (3)]&#10;[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 2 momentum  [2d20 = 9]**<br />
*Zox appears to appreciate Skig's wisdom.*<br />
>The delegates calm own and follow Commander Murry<br />

<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): edit later</font><br />
Zox: No unusual activity occured prior to crew becoming missing.<br />
*Hailey Murry steeples her fingers as she leans forward*<br />
Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: Sensor scans revealed no signs of nearby vessels<br />
Hailey Murry: When did we start getting the warp interference? <br />
Skig: What has been determined so far is that a warp inhibitor field is preventing the Lister from forming a warp field. Attempting to move to higher orbit activated a response from the warp field that caused a spike in energy emissions as well as the mass disappearance of crew through what looked like warp field transference.<br />
Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: It seems highly unlikely that such a phenomenon is naturally occurring<br />
Skig: The interference began shortly after we entered low orbit.<br />
Skig: It is definitely not naturally occuring, as this does not appear in previous surveys of the planet.<br />
Zox: Can you create some way to stabilize the interference?<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
Lt. Malat: I'm with Zox, I would certainly feel better if we had the warp drive online<br />
Skig: Perhaps, there are a multitude of approaches we could take. I believe we need to identify the source of the phenomenon. We could look into the feasbility of offseting the interference by modulating our own field.<br />
Hailey Murry: Is it possible that there's some sort of atomic phenomena interfering with the warp fields? (Hypothesis)<br />
Zox: I cannot compete with your brain, but I think I know who to ask some questions. I will interrogate the diplomats with Lt. Rhoda. <br />
Hailey Murry: It looks like both the Northern Front and the Central Republic have begun to look into the Rolvak Valley recently for the first time in a hundred years. I wonder if there's something in the valley itself which could be causing this. (Hypothesis: Rolvak Valley)<br />
Skig: Yes, I am curious if this was caused by the activity in the Rolvak Valley. Perhaps new technologies or weapons used there triggered some latent and previous inactive ancient defense mechanism.<br />
Zox: Ah. Good. Something to inquire about.<br />
Lt. Malat: That would explain why it was triggered when we tried to move to a higher orbit<br />
Skig: The current inhabitants of this world do not have the technical skill to achieve this, but I previously encountered problems on Preserver planets that had a similar impact.<br />
Hailey Murry: They might not knowingly have access to that level of technology, but there might be something forgotten that someone has activated. By mistake or intent. <br />
Skig: I agree. I believe we should look into the Rolvak Valley as both the cause and location point of this issue. We should start with that.<br />
*Zox nods in agreement. *<br />
Zox: I think we must first gather some information before beaming down, especially given the uncertainty of the warp anomaly. I cannot put our away teams at risk without prudence.<br />
Lt. Malat: I agree, we have no idea what is down there<br />
Zox: Allow me a quick...discussion with our diplomats.<br />
Skig: Therefore, we should approach it from a multidisciplinary approach. Murry, can you and Zox discuss with the delegates, separately if they are worried about &#34;national secrets&#34; their technical level, as well as any strange phenomenon they might have observed around the Rolvak Valley and in general.  Lt. Malat, 11/10, and I will work on sensor and scan sweeps of the Rolvak Valley to see if we can pinpoint the source of the disturbance, as well as sensor scans of the planet to determine if our missing crew have been transported somewhere.<br />
Hailey Murry: Let's check with each of the delegates individually and get their side of how development and exploration of the valley has been occuring<br />
Zox: Perhaps you should try first Hailey. I have been accused of being cold to guests.<br />
>INTERIOR - Crew Quarters: Zox and Commander Murry head to Telar Talis' quarters to get her side of the story<br />

Telar Talis: What is going on ou there? I demand to speak to the captain!<br />
**Skig: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]&#10;[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 1 momentum  [2d20 = 16]**<br />
**Skig:   [8d6 = 29]**<br />
**Skig:   [6d6 = 21]**<br />
Skig: So with 1 Success + 3 Momentum, I used 1 momentum to reroll and 2 momentum for bonus work.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): So with 1 Success + 3 Momentum, I used 1 momentum to reroll and 2 momentum for bonus work.</font><br />
Hailey Murry: Hello again, Ambassador Talis! Our captain is currently predisposed at the moment, but I'll let him know as soon as possible. In the meantime, I wanted to see if we can get started on some background so the Central Republic can get the most benefit out of the situation (Insight+Conn with Bureaucracy; relying on decorum as she asks about the current situation in the valley to better set up the treaty)<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ INSIGHT  (12) +  CONN  (3)]&#10;[Focus: Bureaucracy ]&#10;[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 3 momentum  [2d20 = 3]**<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): End result is -&#62; 8 Work from the roll + 2 Work from the Momentum so a total of 10 Work. I assume there is no extra benefits from the Effects.</font><br />
*Telar Talis calms down and gives Commander Murry some of the relevant history*<br />
*Zox stares at Telar Talis in dinosaur.*<br />
Telar Talis: My people built the valley from the ground up. When we claimed that land, the Northern Front was content to leave it wholly undeveloped.<br />
Telar Talis: It was a unique opportunity to use nearly limitless geothermal power to build a city of the future.<br />
Hailey Murry: Limitless?<br />
Telar Talis: But the Northern Front would not accept our rightful claim on the land!<br />
Telar Talis: Our records indicate that our people built a great geothermal power extractor and used its energy to power the entire city<br />
Telar Talis: We have lost many records of that era, but if our archives are to be believed, it would have been a thing of beauty<br />
Telar Talis: Before the Northern Front laid siege to the city from orbit and reduced it to ruins<br />
*Zox smiles at the mention of geothermal power, it's like a big heat rock.*<br />
**Skig: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]&#10;[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 1 momentum  [2d20 = 13]**<br />
**Skig:   [7d6 = 29]**<br />
**Skig:   [3d6 = 11]**<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Okay - this time around, we have 1 Success + 2 Momentum. 1 Momentum for Reroll, 1 Momentum for 1 Bonus work - total work path = 8 this time.</font><br />
>Skig and 11 and 10 perform a series of sensor sweeps of the valley, togetyer they are able to isolate an energy source in a ruined building which matches the energy signature of the warp interference<br />

<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Skig determines it used to be a geothermal energy plant?</font><br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): (Next time, after someone gives her the background information that is in the chat log that she currently has no idea about).  :D</font><br />
Zox: While I trust you, I must ask that you submit to a search and frisk, ambassator.<br />
