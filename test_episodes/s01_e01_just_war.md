>Captains log, Stardate 61092.5: While en-route to the Spora Nebula to begin our survey operations, we recieved an unusual subspace mesage. The inhabitents of the planet Osala requested Federation assistance to mediate a cease-fire talk between two warring factions.&#13;&#13;The Osalan civilization was once a thriving power in the sector, but more than 100 years of endless war between the Osalan Central Republic and the Northern Front has reduced their civilization nearly to ashes. They probably wouldn't have recognized a more modern vessel as being a Federation design, so at least that is one advantage the Lister has over the Akiras and Sovereigns of the fleet.&#13;&#13;We will be meeting with the representatives of both factions to begin negotiations today.<br />

>INTERIOR - Bridge: It has been several hours since Captain Baras and Counselor Murry began negotiations with the Osalans. Since then, the shouting and table pounding from the briefing room have gotten progressively louder.<br />

**Commander Bachar:** That's it, I need to know what is going on in there<br />
*Commander Bachar pipes the comms audio through to the bridge*<br />
 **Zox:** I'm not sure how to say this, but the situation clearly skinks. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** It was undeveloped wilderness when my people tamed it, why should your people benefit from cities built with our sweat and blood!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/UtrisVixal.PNG" alt="Utris Vixal" width="50" height="50">**Utris Vixal:** There are no cities left! It is nothing but ruins. Build on my people's land!<br />
>The delegates devolve into further shouting<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Commander Murry... Any suggestions?<br />
 **Skig:** Hmm... I notice the Alluvial Damper has reached the Mun Coefficient on the starboard nacelle, I'll just start a level 1 diagnostic on that to make sure we don't have to worry about an issue with expanding the Jool radians.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Just do what you can to get the warp core back online, I don't like being stuck at impulse<br />
*Captain Baras looks very uncomfortable with the tone of the negotiations*<br />
*Zox 'monitors' the rooms around the delegations for disturbances.*<br />
*Hailey Murry speaks to Captain Baras on the side as the delegates shout*<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** It sounds like a situation where the two of them could actually work together to rebuild in that situation if they weren't so focused on their peoples' pride<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** If we can find something substantial to distract them from the past, we can get them focused on the future<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** That is an excellent idea Murry. I... am not the most skilled at the &#34;diplomacy&#34; side of the captain's seat<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Why don't we all calm down and think about the root of the problem. As the commander suggests, this may be an opportunity in disguise. Commander...<br />
*Captain Baras gestures to to Commander Murry to continue*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Ok, it sounds like the captain is throwing in the towel. Anyone want to bet 1-week's holodeck time that they come to blows?<br />

 **Zox:** Generally, we don't try to egg each other on to certain behaviors, that's for the seasons.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Gentlemen, please. I might suggest that this is an opportunity to solve two issues at once. The Northern Front could use the space to settle, while the Republic's economy is in a downturn. I would suggest working together to rebuild and resettle the valley. The increased economic activity and trade would help provide both a home for those in need and economic stimulation to provide for them as they settle. <br />

*Telar Talis and Utris Vixal sit back down and look at Commander Murry*<br />
 **Skig:** Lt. Cmdr Viraseti, could you assist me with these sensor scan results?  I believe this is an unusual phenomenon external to the ship which is inhibiting our warp field.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** That is... reasonable<br />
<img src="../images/auto/UtrisVixal.PNG" alt="Utris Vixal" width="50" height="50">**Utris Vixal:** We could accept that compromise<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There is no obvious source of that warp field, it is almost as though the planet itself is emanating it...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Well, that is one issue resolved at least<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Perhaps we should take a brief rest and get something to eat in the mess?<br />

>Two security officers walk over to the briefing room door and stand ominously behind the delegates, looking threatening<br />

 **Skig:** We could try moving out of range and see if the warp field re-estbalishes itself?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Agreed. Malat, move us to a higher orbit<br />
*Skig obviously has a Tellarite accent for certain words.*<br />

>Captain Baras suddenly vanishes into a flash of light while crossing the bridge to the turbolift<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Yellow Alert! Zox, raise shie...<br />
 **Skig:** Commander, I do not think we should continue our ascent as the warp field suppression seems to be...<br />
>Before she can finish her order, Commander Bachar vanishes as well<br />

 **Skig:** Zox, I believe she wanted you to raise Shields.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** The delegates!<br />
 **Zox:** Shields up! Run a trace on all transporter beams!<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti vanishes mid-sentence*<br />
 **Zox:** Leapin Lizards! What's happening?!<br />
 **Skig:** There is no reason to panic Zox.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We believe the Lietenant Commander was attempting to say that the dissapearances are related to the warp interference<br />
 **Skig:** Have you raised the shields? And were the shields up prior to Viraseti's disappearance?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The energy signature does not match a transporter, it matches a jump to warp<br />
 **Skig:** That seems likely 11 and 10.<br />
 **Zox:** The shields should be up now, and no they were not up in an attempt to show good will with the ambassators on board.<br />
 **Skig:** Right, so bring the ship back to its original orbit to see if the warp field instability from the interference field generated by the planet stabilizes.<br />
 **Skig:** Thank you Zox.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Aye sir<br />
*Lt. Malat pilots the Lister back to its lower orbit*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** A jump to warp? Why are crewmen being jumped to warp? <br />
 **Skig:** Murry, as the diplomatic one, can you ensure the safety of the diplomats and see to their disposition while we look into this situation?<br />

*Skig performs a sensor scan on the warp field to determine what is going on.*<br />
 **Skig:** The field energy from the warp disturbance is returning to normal levels. I can form a supposition that whatever is controlling this warp inhibitor field wants us to remain in a lower orbit.<br />
 **Skig:** Zox, can you perform an internal scan to see how many crew have disappeared from this warp-transporter situation?<br />
 **Zox:** Aye-Aye.<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Skig has called a meeting of the remaining senior staff to investigate the warp field interference and the crew's dissapearance<br />

 **Skig:** While nothing can be discounted, let us consider the high likelihood that neither of your peoples are capable of this level of technical sophistication.<br />
 **Skig:** Thank you Zox.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/UtrisVixal.PNG" alt="Utris Vixal" width="50" height="50">**Utris Vixal:** Hah! Sounds like hte unhigned accusations of the Central Republic!<br />
*Skig looks at the delegates.*<br />
>Utris and Telar nearly come to blows before the security officers separate them<br />

 **Zox:** Murry, can you escort these two to the brig? I think the situation will get the best of them.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Delegates, please. We'll get to the bottom of this in no time. This sort of circumstance can happen without any malefactors. Meanwhile, come with me and I'll arrange for some lunch. <br />
 **Skig:** Sirs, while I can appreciate the fear of the unknown when presented unknown information, please consider whether your technical skills would be capable of the observed behavior.<br />

>The delegates calm own and follow Commander Murry<br />

<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): edit later</font><br />
 **Zox:** No unusual activity occured prior to crew becoming missing.<br />
*Hailey Murry steeples her fingers as she leans forward*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Sensor scans revealed no signs of nearby vessels<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** When did we start getting the warp interference? <br />
 **Skig:** What has been determined so far is that a warp inhibitor field is preventing the Lister from forming a warp field. Attempting to move to higher orbit activated a response from the warp field that caused a spike in energy emissions as well as the mass disappearance of crew through what looked like warp field transference.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It seems highly unlikely that such a phenomenon is naturally occurring<br />
 **Skig:** The interference began shortly after we entered low orbit.<br />
 **Skig:** It is definitely not naturally occuring, as this does not appear in previous surveys of the planet.<br />
 **Zox:** Can you create some way to stabilize the interference?<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I'm with Zox, I would certainly feel better if we had the warp drive online<br />
 **Skig:** Perhaps, there are a multitude of approaches we could take. I believe we need to identify the source of the phenomenon. We could look into the feasbility of offseting the interference by modulating our own field.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Is it possible that there's some sort of atomic phenomena interfering with the warp fields? (Hypothesis)<br />
 **Zox:** I cannot compete with your brain, but I think I know who to ask some questions. I will interrogate the diplomats with Lt. Rhoda. <br />
 **Hailey Murry:** It looks like both the Northern Front and the Central Republic have begun to look into the Rolvak Valley recently for the first time in a hundred years. I wonder if there's something in the valley itself which could be causing this. (Hypothesis: Rolvak Valley)<br />
 **Skig:** Yes, I am curious if this was caused by the activity in the Rolvak Valley. Perhaps new technologies or weapons used there triggered some latent and previous inactive ancient defense mechanism.<br />
 **Zox:** Ah. Good. Something to inquire about.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** That would explain why it was triggered when we tried to move to a higher orbit<br />
 **Skig:** The current inhabitants of this world do not have the technical skill to achieve this, but I previously encountered problems on Preserver planets that had a similar impact.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** They might not knowingly have access to that level of technology, but there might be something forgotten that someone has activated. By mistake or intent. <br />
 **Skig:** I agree. I believe we should look into the Rolvak Valley as both the cause and location point of this issue. We should start with that.<br />
*Zox nods in agreement. *<br />
 **Zox:** I think we must first gather some information before beaming down, especially given the uncertainty of the warp anomaly. I cannot put our away teams at risk without prudence.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I agree, we have no idea what is down there<br />
 **Zox:** Allow me a quick...discussion with our diplomats.<br />
 **Skig:** Therefore, we should approach it from a multidisciplinary approach. Murry, can you and Zox discuss with the delegates, separately if they are worried about &#34;national secrets&#34; their technical level, as well as any strange phenomenon they might have observed around the Rolvak Valley and in general.  Lt. Malat, 11/10, and I will work on sensor and scan sweeps of the Rolvak Valley to see if we can pinpoint the source of the disturbance, as well as sensor scans of the planet to determine if our missing crew have been transported somewhere.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Let's check with each of the delegates individually and get their side of how development and exploration of the valley has been occuring<br />
 **Zox:** Perhaps you should try first Hailey. I have been accused of being cold to guests.<br />
>INTERIOR - Crew Quarters: Zox and Commander Murry head to Telar Talis' quarters to get her side of the story<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** Hello again, Ambassador Talis! Our captain is currently predisposed at the moment, but I'll let him know as soon as possible. In the meantime, I wanted to see if we can get started on some background so the Central Republic can get the most benefit out of the situation (Insight+Conn with Bureaucracy; relying on decorum as she asks about the current situation in the valley to better set up the treaty)<br />

 **Skig:** Acting Captain's Log, Supplemental - While entering orbit around the planet to assist with the resolution of a long running conflict, the ship was enmeshed in a warp dampening field that caused our warp field to dissipate. While negotiations were ongoing we attempted to move the ship to higher orbit and that triggered what I speculate was a defensive response. This resulted in the disappearance of 170 crew members, including the Captain and XO, and caused energy feedback issues throughout the ship. We descended to the original orbit and systems returned to normal. The missing crew are still unaccounted for, but we have reason to believe the warp dampening field is emanating from a heavily contested area known as the Rolvak Valley. While we pursue additional research on the area, I have asked Counselor Murry to speak with the delegates from both sides and tasked Security Chief Zox to assist her in gathering any useful information the diplomats may have about the current situation. I also need to get a sense of where the crew is from a morale standpoint. We are down over 1/3 of our complement and everyone needs to stay focused and alert lest we face attack from whatever is generating the warp field or some hostile force that finds us in this state. If need be I can have Zox run a few disaster simulations on the crew to keep them focused. The ship and I have survived far worse at the Battle of Betazed, but most of this crew is young and I worry about their ability to remain focused on duty in the face of adversity.<br />
>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Skig, 11 and 10 were able to isolate a warp field signature to a ruin in the Rolvak valley. Skig reconvened with Murry and Zox to discuss their next steps<br />

 **Zox:** An away team is assembled for your protection.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, would that by chance be a geothermal power station? <br />
 **Skig:** The remains of one, possibly.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It was impossible to determine the structure's original purpose, so little was left<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The settlement there now is primitive, whatever its original purpose they do not seem to be using it that way at this time<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Whatever it used to be, it is clearly a threat to the ship<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Then we need to head down there and see what they're doing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** A full spread of photon torpedoes will stop whatever it is doing<br />
 **Zox:** I think your direct approach is best Lt., but we cannot rule out our missing crew is down there. <br />
 **Skig:** I agree Lt. Malat; however, that is the second option.  The first option is to investigate more closely, determine the cause, see if there is useful technology to discover, and also whether our missing shipmates are being held there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We concur, agression at this time would be premature<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Plus, I think pummeling a geothermal power generator with torpedoes runs the risk of setting off every volcano in the region <br />
 **Hailey Murry:** This is bad for diplomacy<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Not to mention the loss of life, the Osalans have a substantial presence in the area<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** On the other hand, I suppose it would give the nations reason to bond<br />
 **Skig:** In fact, I was going to ask Malat and Zox to determine the best spread and distribution of weapons to surgically eliminate the threat if needed.  However, I stress the words "if needed" very heavily here.<br />

Starfleet records indicate that his species has some ability to directly control warp fields, although no data on how this is possible<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** This creatures appears to be in a medically induced coma in its stasis chamber. From what I remember of the medical studies class I took with the super-nerdy Denobulan who liked to drool on me, Starfleet has encountered this species before on planet Tau Alpha C, it is definitely not native to this planet, but when encountered previously it demonstrated some sort of effect on warp fields.<br />
 **Zox:** Hrm. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Yes. what the super smart Bynars just said agrees with me, so my memory is correct. Also, did you know that Denobulans have very long prehensile tongues?<br />
 **Zox:** Most authoritative; excellent work.<br />
 **Zox:** Better than this tongue?<br />
*Kolea checks Zox tongue-work.*<br />
*Zox unrolls a similar frog-esque tongue.*<br />
 **Zox:** Some find it....ribbiting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Hmm... we should have a comparison test later when there is not so much immediate danger.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan:** So the question at hand: Is he causing the effects from stasis, or is there another here?<br />
 **Zox:** Can we bring the Traveller to med bay and perform a full examination?<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** We would have to get him out of there first<br />
 **Zox:** ....and how would you propose doing that?<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Skig would want to correlate whether the destruction of the geothermal plant might have activated (perhaps subconsciously) the warp field effect from this entity, and more importantly, if it has been noted that this effect started after the geothermal plant was destroyed. Given the planetary society has regressed as a result of the war, they might not have noticed, so she would need some help from Murray and the diplomats on figuring out the feasibility of this timeline.</font><br />
**Crewman McAllister:** Um...<br />
*Crewman McAllister holds up a phaser*<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Or, short version - did the power plant getting blown up trigger a defense mechanism and we are the first people to discover this?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I am relatively certain that is a bad idea, as it might kill the entity without following the proper protocols to bring him out of stasis. Medically I cannot condone this course of action.<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** So what do you suggest then?<br />
 **Zox:** I defer to the medical expert of course.<br />
*Kolea looks for panels, indicators, or performs a medical scan on how to safely move or rouse the Traveller without causing him injury.*<br />

 **Zox:** Away team log - Supplemental
Planet Osala proves more enigmatic by the hour. Initial scans
and starfleet intelligence indicated the inhabitants
as scarcely advanced enough to begin the great migration into space,
yet the warp field disruptions we experienced tell of an understanding
of warp field theory beyond our own coupled with the malice to weaponize such knowledge.
I have taken ensigns Kolea and Okadan down with me to the planet finding
a curious den of an off world species known only as Travellers, aptly
named because they clearly do not like visitors. I am proud that
starfleet produces such capable crew, else we may have succumed to
security measures. Whereas Okadan handles himself professionally, I
think something in the air has gotten to Kolea; her pheremones appear
an empty signal as she has not collected enough vegetation to nest properly.
We will attempt to take the Traveller on board for questioning and treatment,
perhaps giving us an opportunity to locate our missing crew.<br />
>INTERIOR - Sickbay: After the emergency transport to sickbay, Dr. Zerra is tending to the stricken Traveller. Commander Zox and the rest of the away team look on...<br />

 **Skig:** I will run some scans from the bridge to evaluate the situation, then come down after we have determined the best course of action.<br />
 **Zox:** Thank you Commander.<br />
 **Skig:** Doctor, have you determined if there is any risk of infectious disease or contaminant on this individual that would necessitate higher level quarantine that our current precautions?<br />

*Zox Orders a security detail around sickbay*<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** Commander Zox, permission to return to my post<br />
<font color="##005500">Feneril: before I am killed</font><br />
 **Zox:** Sure.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Were we able to obtain up any information from the system he came from? <br />
*Crewman McAllister runs away joyfully, having survived his first scene*<br />
 **Zox:** Hailey, perhaps we should ask our diplomats about this our new guest?<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Absolutely<br />
 **Skig:** I think that is a good idea Zox, although I am not sure they will know anything specific.<br />
*Hailey Murry pulls out her PAD and takes a few notes on it*<br />
 **Zox:** Skig, have you ever given thought to the fragile mammlian nerve system? Do you think it would be possible to analyze heat and nerve signatures when Hailey is talking to the diplomats to determine if they are telling the truth?<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Were we able to figure out anything from the automated systems? How long he was there, when he awoke, the nature of the building? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan:** I've got those, Doctor. Let me upload them now for you<br />
 **Zox:** That is a good question Hailey. Perhaps we should beam down a technical crew with a security detail until the Traveller wakes.<br />
 **Zox:** Oh excellent!<br />
 **Skig:** Now that the immediate situation has passed, I think that is a great idea, if needed we should return to the surface to gather additional information. Is the high level of radiation dissipating also?<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** Skig, do you want to take a look at this before I go?<br />
>A level 4 containment field spring up around the Traveller's sickbay bed<br />

 **Skig:** The warp field inhibitor affecting the ship has dissipated, there are 20-30 satellites projecting smaller warp fields in geosynchronous locations around the planet, but they are not posing a danger to the ship. We are still without our missing shipmates though.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** The data on the facility has hundreds of instances of "neutralized" organisms within the last 24 hours. Potentially our crew? <br />
 **Hailey Murry:** 12 hours, pardon me<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks over Commander Murry's shoulder*<br />
 **Skig:** Excellent, that could explain our missing crew, does the number equal or exceed our missing crew count?<br />
 **Skig:** And most importantly, how do we get them back?<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** Crewman Oakadan, please provide copies of this to Doctor Zerra and Skig. I need to go have a word with Ambassador Talis. <br />
*Zox 's Face pulses red in a chamelon like fashion.*<br />
 **Zox:** Thank you.<br />
>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Commander Murry has summoned Abassador Talis for questioning<br />

 **Skig:** So did we trigger a defense mechanism that tried to "neutralize" an outside threat to the planet?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** What defense mechanism could my people posess that would be a thread to the mighty Federation?<br />
<font color="##005500">Feneril: threat*</font><br />
 **Zox:** I count 170 potential ways.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** We asked you here to help us, not to spring some trap on you<br />
 **Zox:** That may be true. It's possible you are being played by yet another entity.<br />
 **Skig:** My apologies ambassador, Zox was not using his inside voice when the door opened.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** It's a good question. How much do you know about your planet's defense mechanisms?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** Not much, any such technology was built long before I was born<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** We have only the stories of our elders, passed down over the many years since<br />
*Zox points to small holes in the side of his head.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** We know that we once ruled the stars, as you do<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** What sorts of stories did they tell? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** When the war began, we fought on the ground, in the air and in the stars above our world<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): How long ago was this?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** All of our space-faring vessels were destoyed within a decade<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** When we ran out of ships, we fought with planes. And when we ran out of planes, we fought with phasers, and guns, and eventually our bare hands<br />
*Zox stares at Telar's hands. Zox is not impressed at their war-making capacity.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** If there is some planetary defense system that is threatening your ship, then it must have been the Northern Front's doing<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** I have to wonder if it was a technology that came before the war<br />
 **Zox:** Very much so, if you cannot remember how long it has been, how accurate could your arsenal inventory be?<br />
 **Skig:** Such is the travesty of war, that regression into stone age technology follows this level of destruction, it is fortunate you skipped the "global thermonuclear" option.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Do you know if citizens from the Central Republic been frequenting those ruins recently?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** No, the Northern Front occupied that land 20 years ago<br />
 **Skig:** Ambassador, realistically, if the Northern Front was capable of this, I would expect them to have overrun and conquered you long ago. Not as an insult to the bravery of your fighters, but because if they had the ability to incapacitate and neutralize hundreds of people from space, they could have applied such technology to eliminate entire armies of yours.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** They stole it from my people<br />

*Skig steps outside into the hallway.*<br />
*Zox stares at Skig.*<br />
 **Zox:** Satellites need to be rounded up. You too, surely were thinking of a creative way to approach this while enduring that banter?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** We asked the Federation for help because, in the stories of our elders, the Federation was a gleaming empire of peace with umatched technology and neutrality<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TelarTalis.PNG" alt="Telar Talis" width="50" height="50">**Telar Talis:** I am sad to see the stories were wrong, your crew are missing and the best you can do is ask us for help...<br />
 **Skig:** Zox, it appears the satellites are in a geosynchronous orbit, patterned after a net which is likely intended to defend the planet. Given what the ambassador told us and the length of the war going on, I am somewhat suspicious this entire array either was installed after their lost their spacefaring ability or was installed long ago to protect this species, similar to systems installed by the preservers.  What is your take?<br />
 **Zox:** Yes.<br />
 **Zox:** I trust your summation.<br />
 **Skig:** I would prefer not the destroy them, but to collect them for research and examination. However, I am worried there is a risk of triggering additional defensive responses as we test them. What do you suggest as the Security Chief to keep the crew and ship safe while we investigate this?<br />
 **Zox:** But I feel excessive use of force will be bad now, rather a gravimetric well should be used to pull them into a Lagrange point, incase our crew is stranded in them.<br />
*Zox blinks in reptile.*<br />
 **Zox:** Yes we think alike.<br />
 **Skig:** Excellent, I had not considered that option, but that is a logical next step. Let's see how we can enact that plan.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** We're doing quite a bit more at the moment. I'm confident that we'll get to the bottom of this, but it does appear that we're dealing with something that is tied into the history of your planet. Pre-war, even, by the looks of it. I imagine we'll have the situation resolved sooner rather than later!<br />

 **Zox:** Very interesting. Rather than be centralized, a distributed denial of warp serivce proves very effective!<br />

>Skig is fairly confident that this is Osalan technology, it is crude and fairly primitive, but very clever. The device is at least 120 years old. The control mechanism is a standard computer core. You can't tell whether they are providing any usefrul protection to the planet. As to evidence of where the crew might and how to get them back, Skig recalls that Starfleet has previously recorded instances of officers becoming trapped in static warp bubbles <br />

 **Skig:** Zox, if we can engage in diplomatic discourse with a species that Starfleet has limited contact with in a peaceful fashion and improve our knowledge of warp fields and this technology (gestures at satellite) then that is the route we should take. However, a backup plan using our own technology is never a bad idea.<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** Yet eating and drinking can serve other purposes as well. I've always found the ritual to be calming<br />
*Hailey Murry takes a sip of tea*<br />

>Counselor's Log - The diplomatic mission to Supplemental Planet Osala is proving to be deeper than anticipated. It's been nearly 48 hours since a third of our crew vanished, including Captain Balas, and they weren't even in an Away team this time. 
The primary clues to their location came from an interview with Ambassador Talis of the Central Republic, data from a planet-side facility, and the Traveler we found in stasis within that facility. The Traveler was certainly involuntarily involved with the warp fields which took our crew members, and it appears a number of geosynchronous satellites from hundreds of years ago may have been involved as well. 
While I would love the opportunity to question the Traveler and get to the bottom of this directly, it appears he is greatly distressed at the circumstances. He has been fading in and out of reality for several minutes now and is becoming less and less responsive. I've requested assistance, hopefully a change of staff can draw him back to our reality.<br />

>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Commander Murry called Skig and Zox back to sickbay, as the Traveller began ominously phasing in and out of reality. Fortunately, the ship hasn't exploded. Yet.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** His vital signs are all over the place. Although... I don't really have any idea what "normal" is for his species<br />

 **Zox:** I wonder if this is a physics problem more than a biology problem...<br />
 **Zox:** Me thinks this poor traveller is trapped in a bubbly human seltzer of scrombled warp bubbles.<br />
 **Zox:** Perhaps there is a way to fuse these bubbles.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Is he still trapped, despite all appearances? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** His neurotransmitter levels are off the scale, this could be his version of a "fight or flight" response<br />
 **Zox:** I am sorry Dr. Zerra, but this perhaps may be a case left to Skig.<br />
 **Zox:** Perhaps the answer is in the satellite network. <br />
*Traveller opens his eyes and looks at Zox*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** It very well might be, but I think first we should see if we could get our guest something to calm him down while we work on that<br />
**Traveller:** Inside... yes...<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Insight what? <br />
**Traveller:** Me!<br />
*Traveller cries out in pain and a bright flash of light washes over sickbay*<br />
*Skig arrives in MedBay while holding several pieces of a disassembled Osalan satellite.*<br />
>When the light subsides, the traveller is gone<br />

 **Skig:** It appears that a significant number of entities are trapped in a warp bubble that was...<br />
*Skig looked annoyed.*<br />
*Skig looks annoyed.*<br />
 **Zox:** hrm?<br />
*Skig ...manifested by a combination of the Traveller's natural abilities and this collection of relay satellites.*<br />
 **Skig:** ...manifested by a combination of the Traveller's natural abilities and this collection of relay satellites.<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (Comms):** 11 to Skig. Sir, what is going on down there? Something... unusual has happened<br />
 **Skig:** Define "unusual"?<br />
 **Skig:** For reference, very little "usual" has happened in the last 48 hours.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Sensors were knocked offline momentarily, and when they came back... Well, we are not sure how to say this...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But, the entire universe seems to be a toroid, 400,000 km in diameter<br />
*Zox looks contemplative.*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** That is...not very large<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Sir, I am reading commbadge signals on the planet's surface<br />
*Zox begins to wonder what plants he ate.*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Where are they at, Lieutenant? <br />
 **Skig:** I would say we have been teleported into an alternate pocket dimension where the crew and who knows how many other creatures have been sent via Warp Transference by the Traveler and the Osalan technology over the past 100 years.<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Centered around the Rolvak valley<br />
 **Skig:** How many total lifesigns from the Rolvak Valley are you reading?<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Approximately 25,000<br />
 **Skig:** Let me amend that, "Total lifesigns of sentient creatures we would need to figure out how to evacuate from their prison."<br />
 **Skig:** Thank you for understanding my ambiguity and providing the information I requested, Lt Malat.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Wait, so they're not rescued, we've been captured? <br />
 **Skig:** Right, that is my working hypothesis at this point.<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** It seems that way ma'am<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Your first command has been a rousing success thus far commander.<br />
*Zox flushes a dark, crimson red.*<br />
 **Zox:** No prison can contain the prime directive! We will break free!<br />
 **Skig:** Bynars, can you scan for the sector of space where the satellites were clustered by the deflector dish and see if that is a valid egress point for the warp bubble if we can generate the inverse warp bubble we posited earlier?<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (Comms):** Yes commander, we will begin right away<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** I'm glad we've got you around, Skig<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, you're doing an admirable job under difficult circumstances sir. <br />
 **Skig:** A commanding officer is only as good as the crew who supports her.<br />
 **Skig:** Now that we are here though, let's see about finding the missing crew. Lt Malat are you able to locate the CO or XO and raise them on comms?<br />

*Zox claws furiously at a panel on the wall.*<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Commander Bachar's comm badge is reading loud and clear, the captain's is a weaker signal.<br />
 **Skig:** Let's raise Commander Bachar and determine how the missing crew is doing. Dr. Zerra, hopefully we will not need your services too much, but I imagine we will have some people who will need medical attention.<br />
 **Zox:** Skig, may I suggest the use of pattern enhancers to lock onto our crew and beam them aboard as a first measure?<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Lister to Bachar, do you copy?<br />
 **Skig:** Sorry Zox, they do not quite work that way.<br />
**Commander Bachar (Comms):** Malat? How did you... Nevermind that, who's in command? Tell me it isn't you...<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Your last transmission was unclear. Perhaps we need to take the comms offline to see if we can fix that...<br />
 **Skig:** Commander Bachar, I have assumed command of the Lister until you and/or the Captain return to the ship. Are you with the Captain?  His comm badge is not responding properly.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Negative. The captain was captured. Is Zox up there? If so, I need him to assemble a security detail and get down here<br />
 **Zox:** Captured?<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Well, this is an added complication<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Are the diplomats still on board? <br />
 **Zox:** Full security detail, transporter room 1.<br />
 **Skig:** Captured by what would be a good question.<br />
*Zox leaves for the transporter room.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** This place is a warzone, the Osalans in here have been fighting for over a century. We have been attacked a dozen times in the past 2 days<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />

*Kolea stopped in her quarters to apply some nice perfume that would be pleasant for herbivorous dinosaurs.*<br />
 **Zox:** Excellent Kolea, I hope you can keep some of them alive for questioning.<br />
>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: Commander Zox beams down with an away team and some pattern enhancers. He finds himself in the ruins of a city. A river is running through the ruins nearby, and in the distance he sees a handful of officers huddled around a fire in a ruined building<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Well, and also treating any injured Starfleet personnel, but my job is to treat the injured.<br />
*Commander Bachar pops her head out from behind a barricade at the sound of the transporters*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Commander, over here!<br />
 **Zox:** Commander!<br />
 **Zox:** What a relief. We have found you!<br />
*Kolea heads over and looks for injured who need treatment and/or immediate evacuation.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Christ am I glad to see you. I hope Skig has a plan for getting out of this... whatever the hell this is<br />
 **Zox:** It appears so.<br />
 **Skig:** (over comms) Dr Zerra, prepare to receive injured in Transporter Room 2 (because we will Story Declaration that is the one closest to Sick Bay)<br />
 **Zox:** First, we must secure a spot for these pattern enhancers.<br />
*Commander Bachar looks haggard and exhausted, her hair and uniform unkempt*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** What on earth has happened to you, Commander? <br />
**Commander Bachar:** You, you, you set up the pattern enhancers and help Nurse Kolea get the wounded back to the Lister<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Sir, I believe you brought all those extra phasers down here to arm any capable crew members to assist in the defense of the area. Don't forget to hand them out.<br />
*Zox nods*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** That was some amazing forward thinking of you as a Security Chief, I am in awe of your tactical planning.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I hope so, we were unarmed when we got here. The Osalans' energy weapons died long ago, they fight with spears and bows and arrows<br />
*Kolea resumes regularly scheduled Nurse duties of triaging injured and determining who needs to go back to the ship first.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** Why are they so aggressive towards you? <br />
*Zox begins organizing a defensive position around the pattern enhancers, using whatever crew, im-promtu barricades, etc.*<br />

 **Skig:** Lt Malat, target the far side of the bank with a dispersion phaser blast set to the lowest setting and drive the Osalans back from the away team.<br />

*Kolea gets slapped by the censors, again.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Commander, I think that may have been overkill<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** I'm not sure if a giant beam of death from above is "anti-climatic"<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Also, we need to get out of here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** Hold on!<br />
**Commander Bachar:** That beam will give our position away to both factions<br />
**Commander Bachar:** This position is going to be overrun in minutes<br />
 **Skig:** Understood, we can evacuate you via transport beams with the arrays setup and plan where to move next to recover our people.<br />
*Kurij flips over the dude she knocked out earlier as she runs past to grab the horn*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I'm not leaving the surface without the captain<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** Do we have enough space to keep our prisoners on the ship? <br />
 **Skig:** Lt Malat, Bynars, monitor the area for incoming hostiles and work out a firing pattern to keep the area clear of hostiles.<br />
 **Zox:** Kolea, can you apply some stimulants to one of these stunned humanoids? We need information. Fast.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Sensors are reading large numbers of Osalan bio signatures moving towards the Commander's position, interference is making it impossible to pinpoint exact locations<br />

*Kolea goes to guy #12 (who had the horn and must therefore be in charge) and resuscitates him in a perfectly normal medical way, so she doesn't get slapped by the censors again.*<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Not to mention that they are still holding our crew<br />

**Osalan Soldier:** Oh gods, are you going to eat me?<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** Don't eat me! Loris has some of them in his crawler, I don't know where the Northern Front are keeping their prisoners<br />
*Zox shows all of his many teeth (they are flatt and clearly for eating vegetable matter, but let's see how smart this mook is)*<br />
 **Zox:** Very well. Where is this crawler?<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** I don't know exactly where, but it's on its way now<br />

*Kolea helps Zox get the wounded into position so they can be beamed up.*<br />
*Kolea gives Crewman Burkett her business card for her massage therapy operation before he beams up.*<br />
>As the last of the wounded and the prisoners are beamed up, a massive black shape begins to crest the hills to the south. It looks like a block of apartments on treads, its exterior is covered in a patchwork of different types of armor plating, and it seems to be covered in decades upon decades of filth<br />

*Skig arranges for the Osalans to be moved to the Brig after being checked for harmful bacteria and viruses.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** What the hell...<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** You wanted to know where your people were<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** I'm not sure whether to feel disgusted at the condition of that or in awe at the fact that they've kept it going<br />
 **Skig:** Well, conviently, using the phaser bank on the ship might have brought both factions together so our shipboard Counselor can negotiate a truce with both sides.  Or create the complication of uniting both sides against us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I feel like I need a tetanus booster being on the same planet as that object.<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: The away team are debating what to do about the two massive mobile structures that have now surrounded them<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Suggestions.<br />
 **Zox:** Skig, those ramshackle contraptions look to be made from real Osalan tech, Can we not EMP them both to prevent a bloody conflict?<br />
*Commander Bachar opens comms to the ship so the entire senior staff can contribute*<br />
*Skig gets called off stage as the screen writers go into apoplectic fits because they created seven different scenes to handle all the long complex negotations and that was all boiled into the water when she ad-libbed using the phaser banks on the attacking soldiers.*<br />
*Skig scratches her head and wonders where JJ Abrams is.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** There's no way they haven't conflicted before<br />
*Skig returns to the bridge.*<br />
 **Skig:** It might be possible to modulate the phaser banks or use the sensor arrays to disrupt their electrical systems.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I recommend we let them kill each other, use the chaos to send in a small covert force with transporter enhancers to rescue our crew<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** If they kill each other, they may kill the captives <br />
*Skig brings up the schematics for Ork WarWagons and looks at different ways to use Adeptus Mechanicus Pulse Weapons.*<br />
*Skig closes that Codex, gets out her Starfleet Manual.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Their technology is centuries old, it should be a simple matter to disable these vehicles if needed<br />
 **Zox:** Sounds like a plan to me.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Good luck disabling their spears and bows and arrows<br />
 **Skig:** I agree, we should be able to disable their vehicles if they engage in hostilities towards the away team.<br />
 **Skig:** However, this does not stop them from stabbing the away team or killing the captives.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Their may be a diplomatic solution, have we tried hailing them?<br />
 **Skig:** Right, have they engaged in any hostilities or opened communications with them?<br />
 **Zox:** Do we have a lock on any com badges eminating from the crawlers?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** There are large energy signatures consisted with starfleet commbadges, but the intereference from the warp bubble is preventing us from obtaining a transporter lock<br />
 **Skig:** We are operating from a position of strength in that they know we have superior technology and have used it already. They will demand this technology in exchange for freeing the captives. Obviously the Prime Directive prohibits this response.<br />
*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Agreed, we can't give these people access to phasers<br />
**Commander Bachar:** They have been killing each other in here for 100 years, the last thing they need is more advanced weapons<br />
 **Skig:** Perhaps we can find out what they want, and negotiate some palatable solution where they are each given half of some more advanced medical/life preserving technology and taught they need to work together to make the best use of it?<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** We also have prisoners from the Osalans. We should hail them first, and we may be able to get them on board with a full rescue.<br />
 **Skig:** Or perhaps something agricultural.<br />
 **Zox:** I like the idea of hailing first. We have enough prisoners to negotiate for whatever Starfleet was captured by either side.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Sounds like the best plan we have. <br />
 **Skig:** Okay, let's hail one or both sides, if they do not have communications capable equipment, is it conventional "wave the white flag and invite them over for tea?"<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Skig, I want you and the twins to start working on escape plan in the meantime. I don't want to spend my golden years in this... whatever it is<br />
 **Zox:** What if we just made it rain sufficiently to disable their crawlers?<br />
 **Skig:** Pocket Dimension created by the Traveler to preserve the inhabitants of the valley from the orbital bombardment that destroyed the city that was imprisoning him.  At least, that is the current working theory.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Murry, see if you can make contact via the comms. Zox and I will take the security team and move in covertly. If negotiations fail, I want a backup<br />
*Zox 's skin flushes a red, aggressive color.*<br />
*Skig begins working with the Bynars on a "escape the warp bubble" plan using the satellite array point as where to focus a warp field inversion event.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I'm not sure if that is a "Yes I Agree" color, or a "I hope it doesn't come to that" color<br />
 **Zox:** Oh I agree. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I took it as, "I love a female who gives me aggressive orders and assumes a dominant position."<br />
*Hailey Murry begins working on establishing communication*<br />
 **Zox:** It might be that too<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** 11, 10, can you get us connected with them to begin negotiation? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Aye sir<br />

*Zox Looks to Hailey, anticipating a swift resolution and successful negotiations.*<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 looks at Commander Murry, waiting for her to speak*<br />
*Zox begins to wonder if Hailey is feeling ok...*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Good day, sirs and madams. We're reaching out to you from the Starship USS Lister from the Federation. We're under the impression that some of our crew, who went missing within the last few days, have been kindly taken under your wing. We would like to discuss their return. Please respond so we can parlay. <br />
*Skig offers slow clap of respect for Murry's opening speech.*<br />
>Several moments of silence pass before a robust chorus of laughter erupts from the comms<br />

**Loris Vaah:** My men said the old gods brought fire from the sky! You sound like a frightened child!<br />
*Skig works out a firing solution for a photon torpedo that will hit the upper atmosphere and create an "aurora borealis of red death" effect without actually bringing harm to the people on the surface. *<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** I see, I'm sorry to hear that. If you're unwilling to discuss negotiations, I suppose we'll have to discuss it with your peers. <br />
**Loris Vaah:** I have your people, some of them at least. I am Loris Vaah, supreme leader of the Central Republic<br />
**Loris Vaah:** I would be glad to return your people, but as a show of good faith, why don't you use that sky fire to eliminate a thorn in my side<br />
>Another voice bursts into laughter over he comms<br />

**Korok Avera:** Hah! Asking some little girl to do your dirty work Loris?<br />
**Korok Avera:** You've been trying to kill me for 40 years, now you think some space-child is going to do it?<br />
 **Skig:** Murry, can you go to Briefing Room 2 and prepare to meet our guests?<br />
 **Skig:** I need a security detail with phasers to join Murry in Briefing Room 2.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry ***(away from the mic)*: Are we going to end the discussion here or would someone like to take over?<br />
**Loris Vaah:** I would kill you in a day if you ever came out of your crawler Korok!<br />
 **Skig:** Murry, I believe communications in person are the best way solve this problem.<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Captain's log, supplemental. The situation has somehow gotten worse after being rescued from the planet's surface. This warp-bubble seems to be collapsing rapidly, we still have hundreds of crew on the surface, and Korok and Loris still don't seem to want to be rescued. I'm starting to think I should have just stayed on the planet...<br />
>INTERIOR - Brieifing Room: Murry, Korok and Loris are still arguing about their petty squabbles as the Bynar's notify her that the bubble is collapsing in on them<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** How long do we have until the bubble collapses? <br />
**Commander Bachar:** Murry, deal with them. I need to get back to the bridge. If they won't agree to be rescued, then throw them out an airlock and find someone who will<br />
*Commander Bachar heads back to the bridge*<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (Comms):** Difficult to say, no more than a few hours<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Thank you, that should be long enough. <br />
*Hailey Murry turns to face the pair of bickering warlords, her hands behind her back*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Ambassador Loris, Ambassador Korok, if you could please take a seat. Preferably out of arms reach of one another. <br />
**Loris Vaah:** Ambassador! Ha! No one's ever called me that before<br />
**Korok Avera:** Ambassador's bathe occasionally, Loris<br />
*Korok Avera takes a seat*<br />
*Loris Vaah reluctantly sits opposite Korok*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** If you have a preferred title that you use, then I'll be happy to use that instead. Similarly, if there is someone else that you'd like to negotiate in your stead, we can beam them up. But unfortunately, circumstances necessitate that we begin and conclude negotiations for the survival of all of our people within the next few hours. <br />
**Korok Avera:** What do you propose? You think you can fit all of our people on your little ship?<br />
**Korok Avera:** I have thousands of men<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** I propose that we talk<br />
**Loris Vaah:** No more than I do, and I won't let you rescue a single Northern Front soldier if my men are not rescued<br />
*Hailey Murry sits down between the two of them, steepling her fingers*<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Ideally we're able to rescue them all, but we may need to consult with our engineers<br />
 **Skig:** I propose we rig an inversion transporter that sling-shots people through the Fluxnazit Hydroprophalytic converter that moves them from their current location on the planet surface of the pocket dimension to the exact same physical location (accounting for variances in constructed structures) in the actual physical version of the planet.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** What she said. Fortunately, the valley the two of you occupy here has been UNoccupied on the mainworld for a long time, so there is plenty of space for you there where there isn't much here.<br />
**Loris Vaah:** I... didn't understand a word of that, and I'm not sure it was even words<br />
 **Skig:** Amended of course for what is actually possible given the variances of Galactic Common and the need to cycle through the Alchemical Bifram Defibrilator Oxygenization Matrix.<br />
**Loris Vaah:** But are you saying you can take us back to our planet?<br />
 **Skig:** That would be the plan, yes.<br />
**Loris Vaah:** Using your... teleportation machine?<br />
 **Skig:** My desire to move the process along causes the tl'dr; response of, "Yes."<br />
**Korok Avera:** How do I know I can trust you?<br />
**Korok Avera:** For all I know, you could teleport my people into space. Or into the center of the planet<br />
**Loris Vaah:** Now there's an idea<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Well, you have a large number of our people in your mix, do you not? <br />
 **Skig:** We could send a representative sampling of our own people through first, while you observe the operation, then transport groups of your people pending the maximum transit capacity based on power as well as the monodigylceride content of your fat cells.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** This will, ideally, rescue everyone. Even if our crew weren't planetside, we'd still be working to return you to the planet proper. We were in the process of helping your peoples when this whole thing happened. <br />

**Korok Avera:** That is acceptable to me, my men will keep your crew captive until your plan succeeds, and we will release them when we are safe<br />
**Loris Vaah:** You idiot, this is clearly a ploy<br />
**Loris Vaah:** They will simply teleport their people to the surface and leave your men to die in their machine<br />
**Loris Vaah:** I for one am not such a fool<br />
**Korok Avera:** A fool is exactly what you are Loris<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** We can mix and match<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** If we had the ability to teleport our men out, we would have done so already<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** We can identify people, yes, but not which are ours. We'll teleport people in batches, but you can determine how many of each are in each group. <br />
*Skig contemplates using the teleporter to mix halves of Loris and Korok's men together to create a Voltron-style flesh amalgamation.  Decides to skip that idea because she has clearly been spending too much time around Malat.*<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** Also, Loris<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Korok<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** What do you think about ending the hostilities between your people? <br />

 **Skig:** You would also have a considerable amount of catching up to do on everything else that has happened.<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** This is a chance to bring your peoples from active warfare to a period of peace and prosperity that many literally have never imagined. <br />

>---------CUT TO COMMERCIAL-------<br />

>INTERIOR - Bridge: Commander Bachar, Skig, Zox, the Bynars and Doctor Zerra are discussing their plan for escaping the warp bubble.<br />

**Commander Bachar:** We need an escape route now. Zox, do you think you could punch through with the phaser array? Anyone have any other suggestions?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** A high-energy warp field from our own warp core may be able to destructively interfere with the bubble. It would require significant energy be rerouted from other systems, and would be delicate to properly modulate. But it would give us a way to chart a course out.<br />
 **Zox:** I am not sure how to modulate our phasers to breach a warp bubble without a specific frequency. I would need Skig to calculate this.<br />
 **Skig:** Given the collapse of the warp field, and the fact it is a subspace dimension, I would posit we should be able to basically invert the entire thing through careful modulation of the warp core and cause it to basically shift everyone and everything to the spot it currently is on in reality.<br />
*Zox appears to more aggre with Skig and the Bynars.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I don't care how much this Traveller knows about subspace, no warp field is perfectly isolated from normal space. If we shut down our warp engines and ride the subspace eddies at low-power, the natural subspace current will guide us to a funnel back to normal space.<br />
 **Skig:** I believe that would be true Malat, if we were also not trying to get everyone else on the planet out also.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Perhaps we are thinking about this the wrong way. The Traveller is a biological organism after all, and this region of subspace seems to be part of his body. Perhaps if we make the Lister's warp signature unpalatable to him, his version of an immune system might try to expel us on its own. Like sneezing out viral cells.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** That shouldn't be a problem Commander, we can hold their patterns in the transporter pattern buffer long enough to rid it out<br />
*Skig thinks that is a very interesting idea, not sure how feasible, but would provide a better understanding of the Traveller species if it turned out to be true.*<br />
 **Skig:** True, we could load them all into the transporter buffer and ride out the situation through the eddies.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Ok, so we're in agreement about the warp field inversion. But how do we get through once the door is open? Plot a course directly through subspace?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The sattelites which Zox and Skig collected earlier should still be sitting in orbit around Osala. We should be able to lock-on to their own warp-fields and use that to plot an escape course.<br />
 **Skig:** Ideally the warp field inversion will cause a collapse that pulls us through the satellite relays, as the Bynar suggest.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Plotting a course may not be necessary at all. With the field weakened, we should just need to obtain sufficient sub-slight velocity to punch through. The bubble is too small to get up to speed in a straight line, but a slighshot maneuver should work.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Ok, we're settled then. Skig and the twins, set up the warp field<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Zox, stand by to lock on to the sattelite signals as soon as you can detect them<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** We may be able to use a tractor beam to exert additional force on the bubble directly, it might be enough to push us free.<br />
*Skig is imagining the Traveller with some seriously clenched buttocks running to the restroom of the bar he is currently in, desperately hoping all the stalls are not taken because he feels a starship-sized bowel purge coming on.*<br />
 **Skig:** Malat is there a directional force behind what is holding us? For instance, are we being pinched from a specific direction that would suggest a spot we could focus the beam on?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** It seems to be pushing us straight back. I'm at full impulse, and we are slipping back in<br />
