>Captain's log, stardate 61221.7: Our mission to the Malari system to review their petition for Federation membership is nearing completion. The planet meets Federation standards for equality, liberty, good governance, and techonological sufficiency. The only out-standing report is the assessment of working conditions, which Commander Zox is spearheading.

Per his latest status report, his survey team has completed random inspections of several Malari facilities, but there is one other facility he selected to inspect: a dilitium mine. I worry that Zox is perhaps being overly susicious of the Malari, but I suppose that is to be expected. Regardless, once his inspection is complete we should be ready to break orbit and submit our recommendation to Starfleet Command regarding the Malari membership petition.<br />

*Hailey Murry Also, nothing says "I belong on a mining facility" like a demolitions focus*<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Also, nothing says "I belong on a mining facility" like a demolitions focus</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Mining Facility: The Malari mining crew chief Tumarara is showing Zox and the away team around the mining facility. The facility itself is very impressive, a number of tunnels converge on a large underground chamber where workers operate automated drones to procces the raw dilithium ore and package it for transport<br />

**Tumarara:** Are you satisfied yet Commander? As I explained on the surface, all of the dangerous tasks are handled by out unmanned drones. Now if you are done, we need to get back to work. We have a schedule to keep here.<br />

 **Skig:** Just need to know if I should reprogram the food synthesizers.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** How are you feeling Commander?<br />
 **Zox:** Hissssterical. All squirmy.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Dr, is he fit for duty?<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** I can't tell if he's feeling normal or if he's actually feeling different<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Impossible to say, normal for Zox is hard to pin down<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** As for his fitness for duty, if he is feeling up to it, I would not object. But I would insist that he wear a bio-monitor<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I need to be able to monitor his condition<br />
 **Zox:** Can you explain this condition?<br />
*Dr. Zerra pulls up a monitor and swivels it over so Zox can see, then sits down at his bedside*<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Well, see, your normal cells are the green ones, the blue ones are the infected cells, and the red ones are where the blinky thing next to the light relay system needed extra contrast.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** This is your genetic fingerprint that we have on file from your last physical, and this is your DNA sequences now. As you can see, something in the venom from that creature began the process of rewriting your base pairs. <br />
 **Zox:** While I know the technology has been banned since the Eugenics wars of Terra, can't you just over-write the re-wiriting since you have it all on file?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** We've filtered out the venom, but the process appears to be self-sustaining now<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** That is my hope, but our systems cannot sythesize viable Voth DNA<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I have one hope for a treatment: a live donor<br />
*Skig is pretty certain whoever wrote Dr. Zerra's lines is the same person who wants to her claim that the global variable declarations for the warp containment system need capital letters to show importance.*<br />

 **Skig:** Mining Location A347.17 showed an excessive amount of dust on all their flame suppression units, indicating an absence of proper testing of the failover and suppression systems. Also, their women's restroom had an expired air freshener. However, I believe those are not exclusionary from Federation Membership.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Ummm.. Yes, I agree. I don't think we would be within protocol to reject their petition on those grounds<br />
 **Zox:** I feel we should only approve if they are able to prove they take care of their workers' health; I feel as if they'd need better COBRA coverage.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Yo Joe!</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I am not sure I fully understand what Zox is saying, but their medical database is very sparse. They don't have any record of treatments for this genetic damage that those snake-creatures cause<br />
 **Zox:** That's sort of a problem if they intend to continue to work down there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I don't see why we are even considering their petition, they are barely even warp capable<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** From what I can find in the records, it looks like that was about what was expected. No sign of any sabotage with the ventillation nor sending those worm-things at us. So I have no objections. <br />
 **Skig:** COBRA is only used during severance, and the snakes do not sever limbs, I think they need to show proper STGD coverage. Which is Short-Term Genetic Dismemberment, available from the Ferengi Bureau of Employee Transactional Coverage.<br />
 **Zox:** Well shucks, they think of everything.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** In that case, barring any last-minute objections or addendums to the reports, I will prepare my report to starfleet.<br />
 **Skig:** I agree with Malat, their propulsion and transwarp systems are very rudimentary. However, their proper handling of environmental systems and distant stellar location has likely curtailed development of more robust systems. Their computer and engineering standards are quite robust. Although I did manage to procure a number of these really awesome vaccum tubes from one of their scientists. I plan to add it to my music box.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Before we adjourn, Commander Zox, are there any cultural norms we should be aware of before welcoming your mother aboard?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** The Federation database has almost nothing about Voth cultural norms or traditions<br />

 **Zox:** I....feel a little lightheaded and weak. Like I want to sleep on a heat rock, but more than normal.<br />
*Dr. Zerra opens up his medkit and goes to scan Zox with his medical tricorder*<br />
 **Zox:** I had no idea alien worm-snakes from beyond would have such an ability.<br />
 **Skig:** The universe is full of strange and unusual wonders. Sometimes they are inimical to us.<br />
 **Zox:** Stem cells should be an easy thing to get. <br />
 **Hailey Murry:** You did mention that your mother did not want you to join. Do you think this is going to cause any unforeseen issues? <br />
 **Zox:** If that's all you need to re-encode damaged areas.<br />
 **Zox:** Probably not, but you never know. <br />

*Skig transports Murry into a containment field inside Med Bay that has been prepared to contain any possible contaminants or infection she might have acquired from Zox's new physiology.*<br />
 **Zox:** Correct. Thanks to the genetic prosthesis i currently have, these gases do not present a threat to me in the slightest.<br />
 **Zox:** However, I would also caution that these gasses must be vented for they carry an explosion risk<br />

 **Zox:** Can you engineer me a rebreathing apparatus, Skig?<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** We might want a full-body containment suit, just in case<br />
 **Skig:** Certainly, but if Dr. Zerra agrees, I think moving you to a containment field in Med Bay first might be the best option.<br />
 **Zox:** Very well.<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Also, the idea of Zox's suit inflating like a balloon is pretty amusing</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Rhuk.png" alt="Rhuk" width="50" height="50">**Rhuk:** You must explain Zox what is going on. I do not know which is more absurd; thinking a flimsy human a worthy nest matriarch, or having genetic damage from worms.<br />

 **Zox:** It is only the latter of those two, really!<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** It was via the transporters. It has to have been. Again, I'm not sure they're even viable with the transportation, and with the genetic situation Zox is in I'd really like to make sure they don't take any creative liberties<br />

 **Skig:** That would make sense though, doesn't she need to lay those to get them properly fertilized?<br />
*Skig eats another handful of popcorn.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** You're asking me? I don't even know which sex of Voth make the eggs<br />

 **Hailey Murry:** Oh no<br />
*Skig shudders at the implication of having Zox shove un-fertilized Voth eggs into warm gushy parts as part of some strange mating ritual.*<br />

 **Zox:** Well that's a twist.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I wonder if this is what the genetic damage was attempting to do<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** This could be their form of procreation, fascinating<br />
 **Hailey Murry:** Oh nooooo<br />

 **Zox:** I...I am not sure the words to react that exist in either of our native languages Skig<br />
 **Zox:** But this suit is great work<br />
 **Skig:** Thanks, I am glad it is working for you.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** For the counselor... I think I need to discuss the options with Zox and Murry alone<br />

>Captains Log, supplemental: Murry and Zox are both in stable condition for now. Dr. Zerra is continue Zox's treatment, but is still investigating a safe procedure to remove the... lifeforms from Counselor Murry. In the meantime, I ordered both of them to take some time off. Zox has been spending some time with his mother, and Counselor Murry seems to be hiding from her in Holodeck 4.
 Just to be on the safe side, I've ordered the transporters shut down until we understand what happened. Skig is leading the investigation in transporter room 2.<br />

>INTERIOR - Transporter Room 2: Skig has torn the transporter pad down to its frame looking for the cause of the malfunction that definitely couldn't have possibly been user error in any way and MUST have absolutely been a malfunction, 100%. She's not projecting, you're projecting.<br />

 **Skig:** Beam the eggs out of Murry and into you? I think there is some sort of ethical discussion that needs to happen by people who care about biological processes.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Also, the eggs are mostly alien DNA. I don't know that would be wise<br />

 **Zox:** It can't be safe for those to be in a person.<br />
 **Skig:** I think there was some sort of residual biological material trapped in the transporter filter and it might have mixed with Murry's DNA during the emergency transport.<br />
 **Skig:** This would not happen normally, as it should have been cycled into the normal transporter process for review prior to materialization.<br />
 **Skig:** At least, that's my current hypothesis.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, the transporter biofilter safeties should have prevented that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If this contaminant evaded the biofilter, it may not be safe to use the transporter until we can ensure it is completely eradicated<br />

>INTERIOR - Crew Quarters, Deck 8: Counselor Murry, Lt. Jg. Caiveka, and Murry's mother-in-law (?) are standing over a strange snake/Voth hybrid creature which is currently softly groaning on the floor in the doorway of Caiveka's quarters.
The hallway is lit only by the dim glow of the red alert indicators and the pulsing blue emergency illumination. Down the hall to the left they can hear scratching and hissing, and see shadows cast from the direction of the holodeck entrance, fading in and out with the flickering of the faint emergency lights.<br />

*Caiveka grabs her actual Bat'leth from the wall and sets down her "training one" she grabbed by accident.*<br />
