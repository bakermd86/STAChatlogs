>Captains Log, Stardate 61857.6: It still feels strange to be recording these... We are still awaiting our next assignment at Starbase 34. Murry is heading up the investigation in the meantime. Our situation is currently.. complicated.

> Nurse Krepeka's body is in the brig, under the control of a crazed Vulcan bio-terrorist. Her mind is stuck in Dr. Zerra's body, who is still MIA. The Twins launched themselves towards Earth in a Type-8 probe, without permission or explanation. 

> I guess it would be too much to ask for to take it easy in my first week as a starship captain. Hopefully Murry and her team find a thread we can pull on, I don't want to spend any longer docked at the Starbase than necessary.<br />

>INTERIOR - Conference Room: Murry has converted one of the diplomatic conference rooms on Deck 4 into an investigation center. PADDs containing all the various documents and findings of the investigation are scattered about the table, and Malat has 2 security guards posted at the door to ensure the room remains secure. <br />

*Skig walks in covered in "Star Trek Engine Grease" and looking annoyed, muttering something about "What do they teach Chief Engineers these days".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So, what do we think of the Twins? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I can't believe they were in on it too.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** They know everything we know, we need to track them down<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** And break their tiny little knees<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure if they were<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Neraran didn't rely on them, and they seemed just as caught by the chemicals as the rest of us<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Then again, she is nuts<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** They went AWOL in the middle of a crisis hidden in a probe, hardly innocent behavior<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It is quite possible they believe there is an imminent threat to Starfleet and as they might not have had faith in the Lister being able to relay or deal with the situation decided to foresake the Lister in favor of warning Starfleet.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Very much that.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Well I still way we track them down and rough them up a little<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Also, it's possible one of them might not agree on a course of action, but they exist as a team. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think they deserve some roughing up at least, they could've left a more comprehensive set of notes<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We have a nice blob of Breen in the Brig you are welcome to punch whenever you feel the urge Lt Commander Malat.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** In any case, Ms Murry, what have you discovered that we can act on?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart:** Wow, why all the harsh words shipmates. No need to be so violent<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** You have a lot of work ahead of you Windbloom.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, we've got a few things of note. T'kor reported that he found a device from the twins, and that he'd been monitoring their navigation-based comms<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I hate to be coldblooded, but violence has been a way of life here.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Neraran nuked Zerra's office. Were we able to recover anything from the wreckage?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart:** Violence is a poison man, you've got to detox your soul<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Well, Kolea put the fire out pretty quickly. But the only thing Neraran torched was a supply closet full of bacteria<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** I don't know that a bunch of petri dishes of bacteria are worth anything to begin with<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Geret may know more about this stuff. She was sneaking around pretty effectively.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** They would be amazingly useful to a bioweapons expert plotting to create all sorts of nefarious things to disable or kill a mixed crew like ours.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Whole thing seemed fairly...baroque? Why bother to engineer bacteria when there's replicators. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** At least, that's my guess from my "well-rounded cadet courses" in biology that I had to take.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** If we can have someone look into the resources that were put into Zerra's research, especially recently, that would be great. Any digital logs as well. I'm hoping we can reverse engineer this, because Zerra is stil lout there, and I do believe he was involved in a biological weapons scandal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Probably because replicators cannot generate bioweapons, but you can grow them if you know what you are doing?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I mean, they do have safety protocols on them, at least, usually.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pokes her head through the door*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I hope I'm not interrupting<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Not at all, come on in<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Something very odd happened this morning when I went to replicate my breakfast<br />
*Skig looks annoyed that engineering has another issue which has not been corrected.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There was a pattern lodged in the buffer, and it materialized this inside my breakfast<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Oh that's horrifying<br />
*Skig wonders if we should all don hazmat suits.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** This seems like a security issue.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti places a glass of Mango Lassi on the table, inside the glass is a flip-up notepad with "Tell Zox what you told Zerra" written on it*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): "im okay with this"</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Huh<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I assume it must have been the Twins<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know who else could manually program such a precise replicator pattern directly into the output buffer<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Kolea really wants to know why someone wants Viraseti to have "pillow talk" with Zox and if this will make Murry jealous.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Was this directed at you? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It must be, it was in the replicator in my quarters<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Zox and I can take a look at the replicator for other issues on a security/engineering standpoint. We can also pull the logs for the replicator to see how it was applied to the output buffer.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think we just replace the entire replicator set while we are here. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** How often to do you use it? And has your salad been more fibrous than normal?<br />
*Skig wonders how many copies of the note Viraseti ate before she noticed it.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I usually eat in the mess, this was the first thing I replicated in my quarters since we got back to Starbase<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We could upgrade her to one of those new RFG-9000s like we put in Throk's room. The one that can replicate a whole smoked targ.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We have a few dozen in storage for some reason.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Adds to the olde timey feel, much like starship captains raising grapes, for some reason.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am not sure what the note is referring to, but if I had to guess it is probably about the warp signature. Which means that the Twins were spying on us when we... Those little perverts<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns red with some mix of anger and embarassment*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I think that is because they had to use a VPN to get around the age limitation on PornHub and routed it through Zerra's room.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, at the very least it sounds like the Twins weren't on the same page as Zerra and Neraran <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think one of them was<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** And one of them wasn't<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** but it's impossible to defect against your twin.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Conceiveable, since they are a "re-forged pair" since they both lost their original matched Bynar.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Only way to find out is to track them down and break their legs<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** We do not have to break their legs, Malat<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Save that for Zerra<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Is it safe to say that we've sent out a warning for someone bearing Neraran's description? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Or have we not done that yet?</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know what it has to do with anything, but the only thing I can think that the note would be referring to would be the warp signature from the blackhole near the Sulani cluster<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Ah, that anomaly? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Please elaborate<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, when we encountered the Jem'Hadar there, they gave us sensor records of a Starfleet warp signature they had detected absconding with one of their vessels just before we arrived<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The warp signature clearly looked like a Starfleet vessel, but it didn't match any current Starfleet ships<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I eventually found that while the primary signature looked like a Starfleet vessel, the secondary and tertiary harmonics didn't match<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Did they match other patterns?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Meaning that the primary warp signature was a fake, broadcast over the real signature to disguise it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I couldn't find a match, they won't have the halmark energy signature Starfleet warp signatures<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They could be Klingon, Cardassian, Breen... Just about any other fleet that uses laser-induced fusion injectors<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pulls out a PADD*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The red portion is the primary signature, which I believe is falsified. And the higher order harmonics appear to be legitimate<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know what this has to do with anything though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** This would definitely be a way to make someone think that a Star Fleet vessel has just warped into their area though, wouldn't it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, anyone reading this warp signature would certainly believe it belonged to a Starfleet vessel<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** If this Dr. Tu'Var is a fake identity, it is at least real enough that these messages contain Starfleet medical cryptographic signatures<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** So someone at Starfleet Medical was sending these<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think if we can find Tu'Var, we can find Zerra and Neraran's body<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Someone with suitable cryptographic and espionage skills would probably be able to reverse engineer the chain of trust across the signature to find which authority server signed the egress message on the sending server, then check that against the PADD relays to get us a point of origin.<br />

*Skig is still the fun police for Zox's puns.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** At least, that is what Kolea asked me to do the other day to find out who had been sending her salacious unsolicited messages about wanting certain body parts checked for injury. I told her I didn't think it was possible because it had never occured to me, and why the Chief Medical Officer would know that much about message tracking seemed odd.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I've got it down to one of three terminals, in the Virology department. Can't get any more specific than that.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I was just giving you what I thought was a totally bogus idea that Kolea asked me to look into.<br />
*Skig is amazed.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Well it's the best lead we have, I think?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We can also use the Starfleet reference database for warp signatures if we are headed there, and possibly track down the Twins.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** All roads lead to Earth?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** In that case, I'll order Ghex to set course for Earth<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** And in the meantime, I am heading to transporter room 1 to say goodbye to the captain. His granddaughter is taking him back to Benzine<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** If anyone wants to say goodbye before he leaves<br />
*Skig heads off to "assemble" robotic drones to act as Away Teams, as she is both literal and does not trust Lister people to follow orders.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Come on Peacebloom, let's head down to the holodeck and play Fishing Simulator 24K.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I feel like I'd probably cause more problems than are good for him<br />
*Captain Bachar heads to the transporter room with anyone who wants to join*<br />
*Skig heads down with Bachar to see Captain Baras off.*<br />
*Zox joins Captain Bachar*<br />
>In the transporter room, Nurse Kolea is bringing the captain from sickbay and helping him find his way to the transporter<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Captain, I just wanted to say.. It's been an honor serving with you sir. I wish we were saying goodbye under better circumstances<br />
