We haven't been given any details about the mission, but the rendezvous date is not for several days, so we are proceding at warp 5.

In the meantime, many of the crew are taking some time off. If we are being pulled back into a large fleet operation, we may all be pulling long duty shifts for a while. I can hardly blame them for trying to get a bit of R&R before the rendezvous.<br />

>INTERIOR - Corridor outside Holodeck 4: Counselor Murry approaches the door to Holodeck 4 wearing a matching set of burnt umber slacks and a vest, with a white blouse and a plaid blazer. There she finds Lt. Malat, also strangely dressed with a brown bomber jacket over a tie-dye shirt, denim jeans and black leather strapped boots up to her knees.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** You get a weird message from the twins too?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I did, I'm a bit concerned that you did as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** What'd they tell you?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Just that they needed someone with a "prior criminal record" to help them with a problem<br />
*Lt. Malat rolls her eyes*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** They said they needed my "unique approach to problem solving"<br />
*Hailey Murry does air quotes*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Whatever that means<br />
>The Twins step around the corner wearing matching dark purple tuxedoes over black undershirts, with black slacks and matching purple suede shoes.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** All in good time Counselor<br />
*Skig senses a disturbance in the Force, as if an entire deck of the Lister was suddenly exposed to vacuum.*<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 walk over to the holodeck controls and begin entering in commands*<br />
*Skig 's eyes twitch whenever anyone tells Murry they appreciate her approach to "problem solving".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We can see that Commander Skig is not here yet, we anticipated that she may disregard our invitation<br />
>The Twins reach into a wall panel and disconnect an ODN power regulation monitoring circuit from inside the wall<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** ODN diagnostic system specifications require that power regulators report health status every 10 seconds to the main computer. It will then take Commander Skig 12 seconds to reach the turbolift from her desk, and another 14 seconds for the turbolift to get here from main engineering.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So the Commander should be joining us in: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1<br />
*Skig shows up in uniform with a repair kit.*<br />
*Skig looks at the twins.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Glad to have you join us, Skig<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 reconnect the ODN regulator*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** There is a reason for disconnecting ODN regulators that would imply I not write you up?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Just give us a moment Commander, it will take a few moments for the program to load. We have prepared a speech for this purpose.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** This is foreboding<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We will attempt to explain why we are here, while we wait for the holodeck<br />
*Skig checks chronometer, sets it to, "Moment" and pushes "Start".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have this... puzzle game? You could call it, with our former academy roommate Hollis O'Keefe<br />
*Skig is great fun at parties.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We compete to send one another coded messages. It began many years ago with simple substitution ciphers and other such things, but has gotten progessively more complicated over the years<br />
*Hailey Murry exchanges a worried glance at Malat*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The puzzle which Hollis has concocted has too many moving pieces for us to solve alone. We believe that it is his intention to force us to seek assistance, in order to encourage us to develop deeper interpersonal relationships with our crewmates.<br />
*Skig checks chronometer again to see if "Moment" has passed.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ah, the program is finished loading. We have one more crewmate coming however, just a moment<br />
>The Twins tap a control on the holodeck control arch and a holographic representation of Ishemok materializes just inside the holodeck threshold. He is wearing a white and black checkerboard suit, with an oversize stetson hat and white aligator-skin shoes. In his hands: a black leather briefcase with gold accents.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Computer, please begin broadcasting audio file 100101110101101010010011 via the internal comms radio at a frequency of 790 Mhz<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ishemok.png" alt="Ishemok" width="50" height="50">**Ishemok:** Howdy Partners!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Looking sharp, Ishemok<br />
>The Twins lead the motley assortment through the holodeck arch and into a dingy industrial building. Metal shavings line the floor, and the air is thick with the smell of machine oil. The echo of the crew's footsteps is muffled by the hum of a large 3-phase inverter powering an assortment of machining equipment, and a small transistor radio in the corner is playing.<br />

*Skig blinks a few times as she wonders why she is not filing a report for the Twins sabotaging an ODN Circuit.*<br />
>The twins take out a small set of printed paper cards from their breast pocket<br />

>♫♫♫Upbeat music plays from the radio♫♫♫<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ishemok.png" alt="Ishemok" width="50" height="50">**Ishemok:** I heard there's either a heist or a card game somewhere east of Dodge.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The data is stored in a quantum encrypted memory region embedded inside a holoprogram. It is only accessible from within the holoprogram, and only at a single point.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/radio.png" alt="Transistor Radio" width="50" height="50">**Transistor Radio:** ♫♫♫ Now Leroy he a gambler, and he like his fancy clothes.♫♫♫ And he like to wave his diamond rings under everybody's nose♫♫♫<br />
>The twins walk up a set of sheet metal stairs to a small granny flat above the shop<br />

*Ishemok is offended by the music, damaging to his sensistive ears.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The setting of his program is Earth, in a city called Las Vegas. It is Earth-year 1973, and his message is hidden there...<br />
>The Twins pull back the curtains on the windows and point out a large hotel in the distance, several miles away, towering over a low, broad casino: "De Soto's Fortune"<br />

<img src="../images/auto/radio.png" alt="Transistor Radio" width="50" height="50">**Transistor Radio:** ♫♫♫ He got a custom Continental, he got an El Dorado too ♫♫♫ He got a 32 gun in his pocket full a fun. He got a razor in his shoe ♫♫♫<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The encrypted memory region is mapped to the inside of the casino's vault, and it is our intention to steal it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ishemok.png" alt="Ishemok" width="50" height="50">**Ishemok:** Ah, the golden years of Earth!<br />
>The Twins put on matching dark sunglasses and attempt to look "cool" as they beam with pride at their definitely not-at-all choreographed and pre-practiced speech.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/radio.png" alt="Transistor Radio" width="50" height="50">**Transistor Radio:** ♫♫♫ And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, the baddest man in the whole damn town♫♫♫ Badder than old King Kong and meaner than a junkyard dog♫♫♫<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** This actually sounds quite fun! <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Computer, end music.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 put away their note cards*<br />
*Skig wonders why they didn't ask Kolea to show up for a trip to Las Vegas, after all, it was a den of iniquity and prostitution.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Can we call upon others if we find a need for them, or is this limited to just the five of us? <br />
*Skig makes a mental note to still report the Twins for disconnecting the ODN circuit.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We can include others as needed, however there was only room in the program memory to map four player IDs onto existing character identities within the simulation<br />
*Hailey Murry is definitely planning on having not seen anything of the sort, and is pretty sure she can convince Malat to attest the same*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ishemok.png" alt="Ishemok" width="50" height="50">**Ishemok:** How did all this glory vanish! It's beautiful!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As such, we chose the four crewmates who were the most likely to have skills that would be required to adequately execute a "heist"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure this glory originally existed, this can simply be programmed through pre-obtained assets. Some are historical, but plenty are artist renditoins<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** From a statistical analysis of Earth-based media from this period, we determined that a successful heist always has an engineering wizard, someone that can overcome technical and mechanical challenges as needed<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 look at Skig*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** So your plan is to have us sneak into a holodeck created Casino Vault to steal some encrypted data from a program that is only accessible from within the vault as part of some long running game you have been engaged in?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, precisely that<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** And you disconnected an ODN circuit for this?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed we did<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We also prepared a speech<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ishemok.png" alt="Ishemok" width="50" height="50">**Ishemok:** But Skig, this is the perfect way to sell your genius! No consequences! No commanders not appreciating your talent!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Has your positironic matrix been checked after you were violently assaulted and phaser blasted by Murry?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis of heist media suggests that the leader of a "crew" has to often convince the members of their conspiracy to participate via an inspiring speech<br />
*Ishemok stands at attention.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** No, no, it's okay, if Skig doesn't think she's got the necessary engineering skills, that's pretty fair<br />
*Lt. Malat chuckles*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, Skig probably can't hack it with this ancient Earth technology<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** She would be helpless without a laser welder and an electron beam cutter<br />
*Skig waits patiently for the Twins to respond.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Yeah, it was pretty much game over when she had to put the repair equipment down in the hallway<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** We should get a real engineer like T'kor in here, I'm sure he can manage <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): You aren't insulting the Lister, she is pretty much impervious/oblivious to insults directed at her, FYI.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have prepared a brief dossier on each of the characters that your identities have been mapped onto<br />
*Hailey Murry accepts the dossier*<br />
*Hailey Murry checks the street for this "Plymouth Valiant"*<br />
*Skig reads dossier.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Wait, I get to save body parts from those who fail to follow proper instructions?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I'm sold.<br />
*Skig opens the fridge and takes out some cans of something called, "Pabst Blue Ribbon".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** This appears to be some sort of slightly flammable liquid that is not intended for consumption.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis indicates a 98.6% water content, with a small ammount of ethanol<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Okay, I'm sure we will figure out something to do with them, it is pressurized and carbonated.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So, do we have a map of the facility? <br />
*Zehpr 'Chops' Megee materializes in the room*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Partially, the casino is itself stored in an encrypted block of memory, and so we can only datamine a limited amount of data<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 pull out a large printed paper sheet and unroll it on the table*<br />
*Skig uses full cans of Pabst to hold down the corners to make it easier to read.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** They can be used as paperweights, evidently.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were able to obtain accurate imaging of all of the public areas of the casino floor, and reconstruct a rudimentary blueprint of the non-public areas from datamining<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We also tracked the patrol routes of the casino guards, but at that point it became clear that we would not be able to execute the plan on our own<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So we began planning to involve others for assistance<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 looks at Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Oh, hello commander<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Ah yes, I do not mean to interrupt your recreation<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We had not anticipated your participation<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** But I must alert you all that I have had to alter your fun and games...just a tad though.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Ah yes, it is rec-reation or re-creation though, that is the question.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** What did you modify? <br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** There was no free Quantum memory aboard the lister, and Jasanis had a self-eating oroborous-type data worm in her Padd. The only safe quantum storage was where this program was writter.<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** So whereever the treasure is in your primitive Earth hunt game here, you will also find all of her private communications...for months!<br />

**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Hopefully  I did not spoil your illusion. Surely I could pass for a Chef in one of these eateries?<br />
*Zehpr 'Chops' Megee looks around the room and takes an inventory*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** I had no idea you all had such interesting alter egos!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So, uh, what happens with the non-prepared characters?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Anyone can enter the holodeck of course, but other characters in the simulation will not recognize them as pre-existing characters<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** So...Im not the best Oyster Chef in the Western Continent? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** What will they recognize them as? Just a stranger in the casino? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, just strangers<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Also, how do we obtain new goods? Do we need to purchase things? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Or can we simply fabricate things to a certain extent? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ishemok's cover identity has access to a cuboid metallic storage device containing large quantities of the money used in this era<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** And Commander Skig's cover identity has this machine shop where she can fabricate difficult to obtain goods<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** I will gladly loan it out at affordable rates!<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** I will gladly loan it out at affordable rates!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Ishemok, you know that this is fake money, right? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But we must ensure that no 24th century technology is brought into the holodeck, or it will trigger the security code in the program and erase the quantum memory<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** If it can buy things, how is it fake?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is indeed quite fake<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Do we need to enter the vault and retrieve an object?<br />

**Sam Mulloy:** The data is here only.<br />

*Skig froze for a second when she thought the twins were going to stop with "intelligence" in their last sentence, is happy 10 finished with "information will be erased".*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** As far as I know, this was the only way to save the data.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Then we have no choice but to steal it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So, I have information in my dossier about files on several missing persons. I'd like to visit my office to review these, because I don't think that your old room mate would have included them if they were totally irrelevant<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 take off their sunglasses so that they can put them back on dramatically again*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Correct. Even if you break whatever dull regulation governs the holodeck, that information is well worth it.<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Oh wait, you didn't disable the safety protcols? What sort of holodeck is this?!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** No, we didn't.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The safety protocols are active, however Hollis added code to the program to detect if we are killed in the simulation and terminate the program if that happens<br />

*Skig looks at datapad.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** I would advise stealth over force, simply because whatever form the data takes in quantum memory may have a very fragile projection here. Think glass sculpture or faberge egg. You may pierce the vault, but you have to escape with something fragile.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That is an interesting idea, however attempting to rewrite Zox into a giant monster would almost certainly trigger the security protocol and erase the system memory<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I think I have a ... yes, here, I have keys for something<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Ya know what Skig, that is a good plan, but I'm just too clumbsy in Kaiju form. Gotta worry about that data...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Step 5: I write up the Twins for disconnecting the ODN Circuit.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** You are thinking too advanced for the technology of this period.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The only way to disable all of the cameras would be from within those rooms, by unhooking them from something called a "Betamax"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Isn't that a type of fish native to Regulus 4?<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ne'var forget, zat ze Chef is always ze most dangerous mem'ber of ze team. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Why is there a fish in the security rooms?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not know, this period of Earth's history is very unusual<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Or perhaps I'm thinking of a Bettamax?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** One of those is a recording device, the other is a large fish.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So I've discovered that a young woman, Briley Marijn, was working as a legal secretary for a lawyer named Beppe Renzo. He is a consigliere for the Garbo family, who apparently came to threaten me last time my character looked into them. She's since gone missing, her family hired Tracy to look into it. <br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Hrm.....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Malat should go with those guards to see if she can find your missing person, or we have Zox check the freezer.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/bachar_in_dress.png" alt="Shadowy Woman" width="50" height="50">**Shadowy Woman:** Don't tell me you're going to a party and I wasn't invited?<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Who...?<br />
>A sultry voice rings out from the shadows, as a woman no one saw enter is standing in a dark corner<br />

*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee guffaws as someone sneaks up on the steely detective*<br />
>As she goes to light her cigarette, it illuminates her face you can recognize her<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** The invitation was subtle, was it not...Bachar? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** You probably should have told me once Zox dumped Jasanis' messages into that vault<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** But I did warn you before: Not a damn thing happens on this ship that I don't know about<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It was news to the rest of us.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Except Zox, who is a master of espionage <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So tight lipped he doesn't let even a whisper slip<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Forgive me comman'ndar, it just happened as I a'ceessed ze PADD. Zere was no way of knowing just how spicy ze data would be<br />
*Skig makes a mental note to due a ship-wide internal security electrical purge of all nonessential devices to turn off electronic eavesdropping.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** I don't have any concrete details, but the holodecks are going to be shut down in 3 days as part of our new assignment<br />
*Skig cancels that plan when she remembers what happened the last time she shorted out Kolea's "electronics".*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ze Jasanis is wiley.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** So this isn't strictly a game anymore, if we don't pull this off quick and clean, that data is gone forever<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** And you look like you could use the help<br />

>INTERIOR - Skig's Machine Shop: Commander Bachar stands in the doorway of the granny flat in a floor length, black, high slit dress and a very wide-brimmed black hat that casts long shadows over her face. She is holding a lit cigarette in a long ebony and gold cigarette holder.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** I hate to interrupt, but I saw Zox dumping data from Jasanis' PADD into the Twins' program and put the pieces together.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** But as I said when I came in, we now have a time limit on this little operation. The captain and I just finished a briefing with Admiral Nechayev and at least 100 other captains. They won't say what's going on, but they gave us orders to be on wartime footing when we arrive at the rendezvous in 3 days. That means all non-essential systems powered off, so we need to get the data out of the holodeck before then or it's gone.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Well, to start, that sounds rather unfortunate. But also, how long have you been in the corner there? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** Not that long, it took me a while to figure out what to do with these gold rings<br />
*Cmdr Bachar points to her earrings*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Why can't you just re-classify this heist as a security op and collect full time on it, all while out of whatever fleet maneuver w've been drafted to?<br />
*Skig looks at the earrings she stabbed into her elbow and figures out that might be the wrong spot for them.*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Because then we'd have to explain *why* it's a security op<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** And we're not supposed to have some of this data<br />
*Skig looks more closely at Bachar to make sure she is not missing anything else that would be a "giveaway".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** And I don't trust the chain of command on this one<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Argh<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Zis is no problem! Ve shall cook up a plan and be done wif zit!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** If you bunch were able to find the location of that black market from a bunch of data that also went to Starfleet Intelligence, and they didn't find it, then it means they buried it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** There's no way they're that stupid<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** No offense <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** None taken, finding the intellgence was the intelligent part of that whole ordeal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** If we need any help on it, bring in people that are already clued in<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** We got this joint all squared up. Itll be all smooth like.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** You know you don't actually have to stay in character when it's just us together<br />
*Cmdr Bachar switches into a deep, sultry voice completely different from her normal one*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** But what would be the fun in that Lieutenant?<br />
*Sam Mulloy looks deflated, apparently envious of the high culture of crooks that used to inhabit Earth.*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ze program algorithm will award us extra points no? Surely jou can lighten up a bit, mademoiselle<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** In any case, we need to be moving, and I'm grateful we have Bachar here to help us stay on task.<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ze program algorithm will award us extra points no? Surely jou can lighten up a bit, mademoiselle<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Quite right Commander Skig, we have much to do if we are going to be successful<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We believe that there are five main challenges:<br />
*Skig waits patiently for the Bynar's to finish speaking before offering her synopsis.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Dealing with the guards, dealing with the surveillance, getting access to the restricted areas, activating the vault elevator, and getting access to the vault<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** While, I have a solution for the vault.<br />
*Skig gets out Industrial Skig-Vault-Terminator Pulse Drill.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Of course, it is not subtle.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Which level is the vault on? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** Also not necessarily going to work, what if the safe has a glass relocker?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ey. He's what's we gonna do. We gonna get a buncha low-level street operators to make a'bunch a incidents for the security team to respond to. Nuffin big, nuffin serious, jest a little bit of...undesirable activity what's dey need to make business palatable for their sophisticated customas. Den we hatch a plan. In short, a DDOS attack.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Then I let Throk use the Vault-Terminator Pulse Drill as a hand weapon on any Security Guards who get in the way?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Aight. I mean'z if you don't mind a'bit a a mess dere<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Oh, it will definitely make a mess.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Street violence sounds like my area of expertise<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I think you may have the right number of hooligans for the distraction, as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I mean, at 35,000 RPM with diamond flanges and liquid cooling to vent steam directly into the affected area, it will make a mess of anything.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Dey won't know how to respond to so many low-level crimes so quickly. Dese goons won't can't think on my level, it's what ye don't see, ye know?<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Twins &gt; Amand and Dino Cloutier</font><br />
>Malat -> Trixie McAdams<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Malat -&gt; Trixie McAdams</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Skig -&gt; Ida bauers</font><br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ayy, street violence. I like it. Keep it classy though. We dont want to 'ave the real fuzz show up. Just poke...lot's a poke. <br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Ishemok -&gt; Sam Mulloy</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Have you spent any time with them yet, McAdams? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** This biker gang? No, I was at the casino bar scoping it out<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** You should touch base with your roots, see if we've got some help there<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Will do<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Do we have anyone else we want to bring in? <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I think Throk would be a good fit with the biker goons, though they'd be a bad influence on him<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** No one suspects le chef. Ze deadliest man.<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. gasps*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Kolea would be perfect to slip into the background here! <br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** I shall be in ze kitchen, ready to...accidentally cause a short with an errant souffle!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Well from the goons I met, I am pretty sure they're running a brothel from the casino basement<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Would the biker goons be a bad influence on Throk, or would Throk be a bad influence on the Biker Goons?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Inquiring Minds want to know!</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** We'll want to see if there's any overlap between the bikers and the security guards as well<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** I think a good' infuence. All dey know is da poetry a' bending people a bit. Throk'll teach em class.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** This cool, Throk not used to be well-dressed large black man with so much bling.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Drop some verses while you re-arrangin some faces, eh Ignatius?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I'm not gonna lie, a 7 foot tall Gorn in a leather jacket looks pretty good<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Makes ya reall think all dem synth-threads we got up in space ain't really what'cha call progress eh?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** All the polyester 'aint makin style like that!<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) slicks back hair and gives a toothy smile and a thumbs up.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** They may be less aesthetically pleasing, but Starfleet uniforms are engineered to keep the wearer comfortable in a range of temperature and environmental conditions far beyond what aged animal skin can provide<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) background music begins playing whenever Throk starts walking.*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** You'se just sucked the romance right' outta it Dino!<br />
*Sam Mulloy wildly gesticulates while talking. *<br />
*Kolea shows up in a bunny outfit.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: AFK a sec </font><br />
*Sam Mulloy Whistles*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Is it gettin hotta in here?<br />
*Sam Mulloy takes out a handkerchief and wipes sweat off his brow*<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** This is the third time today I've been asked to come to a holodeck in this outfit.<br />
*"Bubbles" Kolea turns around and looks at her back.*<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Are the seams straight on the hose?<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Also, I need to start checking the crew register, I think Lieutenant Frinkleman has had seven birthday parties this year.<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** I thought maybe it was something about his species, but he is human.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I am one bad-ass walking instrument of destruction, searching for love in the casinos of Las Vegas after deciding to turn over a new leaf following years of violent warfare in Southeast Asia.<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** He wins.<br />
*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee approvingly nods.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Yeah I can't beat that.<br />
*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee hangs up his chefs hat.*<br />
**Pennington:** I believe I may be able to provide a disruption to their power supply. If it's a general repair or controlled damage, we can cause an entire area to lose power and avoid the pointed suspicion that they may have if only their facility is hit<br />
**Pennington:** I'll investigate to see how plausible that is<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** During a minature crime wave too, right?<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Your classic entropy based warfare, gone casino heist. Power out, crime, gang activity, and a kitchen fire all at the same time!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I did notice that this era, and perhaps this program in particular, seems to have issues with our ability to use an EMP to cause that effect. Hitting a nearby substation would accomplish the same effect though.<br />
*"Bubbles" Kolea looks at blueprints.*<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** OOH!!! I call dibs on recon for these spots.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I'm really curious about why one of the mafia's legal secretaries went missing. I don't think she's the type to have taken a job working under the table at a casino...<br />
*"Bubbles" Kolea points to #9 and #10 on the map.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Taking out the power is very thematically appopriate, however our research indicates that they do have a backup generator<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So if a power outage is required, we would also need to deal with the generator in the basement<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Not if ze kitchen is sucking up all the juice!<br />
**Pennington:** The backup generator is surely not as capable as the main power. What systems do they have to compromise on? <br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** I shall cook ze worlds biggest souffle!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I believe the basement is where I store the slot machines I perform "maintenance" on, I can probably shut off the backup generator by "accident".<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Cooking in industrial kitches of this era is done with a flamable gas<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Skig! I have never heard you use airquotes before.<br />
*Skig blinks and looks at Kolea with a confused expression.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** But....zat gas is my ancestors! Zis is heresy!<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** It okay, I use airquotes whenever I say Kolea is wearing clothes.<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Not that time.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I don't think it applies that time.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** Alright let's get moving, it sounds like we have some ideas but nothing concrete yet. What do we still need to figure out next?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Plan of Attack to distract security away from the Vault, and then who goes to the vault and how they get it open.<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): So Tracy is going to be looking into the missing persons again (or specifically, why they went missing; she doesn't want any broken kneecaps)</font><br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Common dollface, let's engineer the diversions while the professionals get to work (looks at Malat)<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I can't distract more than six male security guards at a time. A girl has to have some limits.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** If you call me dollface again I'm going to rip yours off<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): Pennington will be looking to explore and set up the potential main power outage and make sure that'll work</font><br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ah, do not be le sour, it's a game! enjoy zis baroque earth culture!<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Do you want me to apply to work at the Casino, or get kidnapped and forced to work at the Casino? Either one is fine.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Kolea, most people are not enthusiastic about the idea of being forced into sex work.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** WAIT WAIT WAIT... Sex is work? What the Hell is wrong with you?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk feel uncomfortable and wish to turn on air conditioning.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** Yeah I'm not going to order you to do that, but you want to and you can get access to the social club that way, I'm not going to order you not to<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) looks at Bachar.*<br />
*Sam Mulloy feels as though skig should not be in charge of business decisions.*<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Oh, do you want some pointers?<br />
**Pennington:** I could use some pointers<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I mean, that looks really good overall, but I think we could really work on your highlights.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** Murry, checking out this missing woman sounds dangerous based on what you said, Zox, Throk and I will come with you. We shouldn't risk "Tracy" being killed in the program<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** The backup is appreciated<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk happy to help with that. Throk also happy to be Malat's new boyfriend to meet with her associates.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Actually, if I can have Zox and Throk as guards, if you'd like to talk anyone who comes looking into me, that might prove to be an efficient way of performing some espionage on their counter-espionage<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Wait, if you're coded as black in the program interpreter, that might not be a great idea<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): *take rather than talk</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I think these bikers have some... issues, with black people<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Okay, Throk not want Malat to have to find work next to Kolea unless wanted.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk have standards for protection.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Ishemok can come with me, these people sound like a bunch of sleaze bags, I'm sure he'll fit right in<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk also want to ride large two wheeled, environmentally destructive vehicle through glass windows while firing shotgun.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** If any part of plan can involve that, Throk happy.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ey. No need ta get clippy. I represent the highest standards of business. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I'm sure I can come up with a program to let you do that Throk.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk content then. Throk go with murderous psychotic Counselor woman and collect heads of her victims.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We can assist T'Kor and Skig with the power situation<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ah ze ingredients are all together. Soon the ensemble will be complete.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** All right, sounds like we have a few plans. Bynars go with T'Kor and Skig and work out the primary and secondary power. Kolea goes and does things that are best left unsaid. Malat and Mulloy go and meet with her never-do-wells. Everyone else goes with Murry to increase the bodycount. Did I miss anyone?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Skig being me, since for some reason I decided to refer to myself in third person at some point there.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I shall go become gainfully employed!<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) leaves to get a job doing tricks at a casino.*<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
>EXTERIOR - Office Building downtown: Tracy pulls up outside the building where Beppe Renzo it listed as having a law office. Bachar is in the passenger seat of her car, while Throk and Zox are sitting up on the rear like a couple of big, green dogs<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I PITY THE FOOL.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** Don't kill anyone unless they try to kill us first<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) gets out of the vehicle while background music plays.*<br />

**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Human holo-deck writers still use the baroque conventions established in the early 21st century when designing games. Surely, the white key...I mean white keycard, will get us the treasure.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Me thinks too many of these convetions draw from something stuck in human psychology, always looking for that item in the maze....<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** We just need a few good distractions and this caper wraps itself up.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I expect that it is some sort of keycard, but the question is what for and whether there are external passwords to analyze<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** No, no it really doesn't. Then we get to play the game unscripted after we get this quantum data...<br />

*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) inserts fingers in earholes and begins going, "LALALALALALALA"*<br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should go over everything again quickly. 11, 10 can you give us a quick briefing?<br />
*Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio thanks the twins*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Thanks to Commander Zox... Apologies: Thanks to Guido, his new employment at the casino restaurant has given him access to the areas shaded in green. And by accessing them, it has allowed us to more accurately detect their contents with a greater level of detail. "Bubbles" has also obtained a form of employment which cannot be described in detail on this network at this timeslot, additional deleted scenes may be available on the unrated collectors' edition BluRay. Suffice to say that she now has access to the "social club" beneath the casino (9).<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** While neither area grants direct access to any critical areas, the social club shares a common internal wall with the vault (12) and generator (11) areas. Although that wall is quite substantial: more than 30cm thick.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Guido's position also gives him access to an employee lounge (3) adjacent to the floor security office (4). While the kitchen (5) has a small, primitive form of turbolift (C) known as a "dumbwaiter" connecting it to the social club.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Both the kitchen and the loading dock (6) where Bubbles enters the building for "work" share a common wall with the count room (7).<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Thank you Commanders. Team, we are running out of time, so we need to get our plan buttoned up and run this op before we get to our rendezvous with the fleet<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Zox, you're the security chief. What are your thoughts on accessing the vault?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Skig, is our drill operational?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Surely your engineering beats pre-WWIII human tech?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It is, this should tear through the locking mechanism in 6.78 seconds.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** If we create a scene at a card table, and have a low level crime wave of just people that need to be escorted out for disorderly conduct, we should have the place suitable distracted to get the vault to ourselves<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Will it do so loudly? <br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Even if it's loud, I doubt a game or primitive humans can deal with so many things at once.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Per Throk's request, it will make a roar like a Brachiasaurus in Heat tearing through all the paper doors and wooden buildings in 1950s Tokyo Monster Movies.<br />

**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Oh goody!<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Ah, but not the vault nor security operations? <br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I was asked to incapacitate one of the inspectors for "bribery" reasons. Unlike Guiseppe the inspector had 32 minutes of stamina and said he was used to these forms of bribery, because it is common throughout Las Vegas.<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Hmmm<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: It's BluRay extras</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So we could have a new inspector come into town<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** To perform an inspection and refuse the bribe, someone incredibly stern and resistant. <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** They'd have to have a lot of technical knowledge and be uninterested in seduction entirely. <br />
*Lt. Malat turns to T'Kor*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Sounds like the kitchen needs an unquenchable grease fire right after the inspector<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** I could go. I'd need to get some of the operating manuals and a solid understanding on what to review<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** You don't need to actually inspect the slot machines<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** We know from Kolea's experience that they are going to bring you to the social club to try to stop the inspection<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Okay - So after a grease fire breaks out, and it's uncontrollable and incredibly smokey, we all have these masks to both let us see, breathe, and look like we are part of the response crew.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** So you would end up together with Kolea in the social club<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Good thinking<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Few are going to want to brave a fire.<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Will the system intentionally disable me during smoke? I do not have to breathe in the same way<br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** What are they doing there?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I can give you an overview of the slot machines and tell you where I rigged them up to cheat in the casino's favor, that would allow you to look very credible in calling them out.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Do we have a plan for them to access the vault from there?<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Pennington (T'kor)): If only Oakadan were here, with his knowledge of fire safety </font><br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Or are they part of the escape plan to get out from the vault?<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Is there anything combustable that may explode? <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Counterpoint. Once the fire starts, will they send anyone directly to the vault to evacuate anything?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Nawh, gotta be a fire-proof vault<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** The vault is on a time lock, they couldn't empty it if they wanted<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** So presumably they trust it will be safe during any fire<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) looks at T'Kor.*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Okay, another question. What if the data is stored in a flammable form? <br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Look, I need you to just follow along with their, "please come down here to inspect the machines in the basement first" plan.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Then we need flame resistant bags, shouldn't be too hard to source, even in this time<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** We'll be in and out long before the fire has time to spread to the vault, we just need to make sure we don't lose anything on the way out<br />
*Skig was equally confused like T'Kor, but then, Skig takes everything literally and completely misses all concepts of innuendo and obfuscation.*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Well. It seems we have a plan<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** So I believe we head downstairs, when people start evacuating we'll bust through the wall and get access to the vault<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** We can then begin to drill through the vault, get access to it, grab the stuff, and make it out again<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So we start off with infiltration. Guido, Bubbles, and Pennington sneak into the buildilng. Skig prepares herself with the getaway vehicle and Malat prepares her biker buddies to make a run on the Count room. <br />

>INTERIOR - Skig's Van: The crew meet back in the machine shop to synchronize before they begin the heist.<br />

*Hadija Zawadi checks her watch*<br />
**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** yes, it is almost ze time no?<br />
*Skig is wearing an eyepatch and a pirate bandana.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Yeah we leave in 10 minutes. Let's review the plan before we set out. We only get one shot at this.<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) looks depressed at nearly killing everyone AND failing medical duties.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** The timed lockout on the vault opens at 0845 and stays open for 15 minutes. So we need to be in position, ready to drill the combination lock by then. Working backwards, that means the Twins need to be at the blackjack tables at 0815. Skig and Murry arrive at the loading dock at the same time.<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) is content to have made a new holodeck friend who had some great mushrooms to share.*<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) offers Pepe some of Juan's mushrooms.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** You know the holodeck safety protocols won't actually replicate halucinogenic compounts?<br />
**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** Oi? A new ingredient? I shall save it for tonight's stew!<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** T'Kor will need to already be in position with Kolea by then, but that shouldn't be a problem. We can assume they will have some privacy and a bit of time.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Don't trip on mushrooms, that will interfere with the plan<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk know many things, for instance, belief in power of mushrooms means they work, even when they should not. Much like religion.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Once the Twns attract the pit boss' attention, we get taken down to their torture room with Throk. T'Kor's sabotage should kill the power at exactly 0830.<br />
*Pennington (T'kor) raises his hand*<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** What shall I do if I am not assigned Kolea? <br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk have firm belief that Pepe and Hadija are brilliant and will lead us to victory.<br />

*Hadija Zawadi smacks Malat upside the head*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** You can stall, or take off your suit and burn her into ash<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** It's a holodeck, none of them are real<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** No kidding, most human males don't have the stamina I've experienced.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** When the power cuts out, Zox starts the fire, and the fire alarm is the signal to execute everything else. Malat and Ishemok storm the casino with the Mohave Cruisers, Throk and I overpower the goons, the Twins kill the backup generator, Skig slips into the club as a firefighter with the getaway gear, T'Kor and Kolea blow the common wall, and we rendezvous at the vault just before 0845.<br />
**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** What? Zere is a religion that has mushrooms as part of its morel code? Tell me more, Ignatius.<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Lt Malat, just as a reminder I am in reality only a few feet away from you. I'm afraid if I removed my suit, I would probably wind up cooking several of you in the process of freezing to death.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Right, I shall head off to "work" then.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Good luck<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) still cannot believe that humans consider sex "work".*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Once we have the intel, we exfil to Murry waiting with the getaway vehicle and we return here so we can call for the holodeck exit.<br />

The away team pick themselves up from the pavement, and wipe away the chunky marinara that used to be the casino pit boss. Raimondo Garbo retreats into the hotel as a bunch of mobsters start pulling weapons.<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I must not care about irrelevant Holodeck characters. They are nothing. Even caring about them is the mind-killer. For the Holodeck is the invention of humans who need LARP-time. It is the time wasting event that brings total obliteration. I will ignore their existence. Their weapons meant nothing, they will pass through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. When the simulation ends, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** So we need to offload uncessary crew, get into position, adjust shield harmonics, and basically create a giant deflector array.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I need to get to sickbay to start replicating radiation meds, the radiation exposure is going to be high for any crew that remains aboard<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That is an efficient summary of the plan Commander Skig<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I do not see where this radiation is being deflected to. I assume this is not being punted into a direction that some foreign power would consider it an act of war or we melt a planet of natives in violation of the Prime Directive.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Viraseti, I want you to get down to stellar cartography and re-run these numbers, make sure this is going to be a survivable level of gamma radiation for the Lister<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns to Skig*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well at distances beyond 500 light years, the radiation would be too attenuated to be of any real danger<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The only reason the risk is so great to Earth is because of its proximity<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It is too bad it isn't hitting some uninhabited planet instead, imagine what a great research opportunity it would be to observe the effect of such a large GRB on a planet!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I would prefer we channel the forward sensor array to create an arc at a distance about 25% greater than what Starfleet is recommending due to the differences in the xenotronium alloy used in ships of this era.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Fuck that ma'am. We should go to this exchange with Jasanis' buyers and crack her skull open.

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Yeah I think if we came in force and with proper equipment, we'd be fine. Empok nor was goofy!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Purely from cost-benefit, and with the Federations desire to prevent harm and destruction, removing Jasanis has the clearest benefit and the least ambiguity. <br />

**Commander Bachar:** I don't love this plan, you'll be walking into a completely undknown situation with potentially 2 different powerful adversaries. And you won't have the Lister for backup. Are you sure you want to do this?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I'm not. I personally don't vote for it until we can figure out who they are. I think we could probably throw things off over there, but I think we can do better at their research facility<br />
