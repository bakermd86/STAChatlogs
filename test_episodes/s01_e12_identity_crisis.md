>Captains Log, Stardate 61796.1: We have had to divert from our scheduled mission to the Sybo Nebula to investigate a potential Romulan incursion into Federation space. Commander Bachar is preparing a briefing on the situation, but all we know so far is that a Romulan vessel was detected in the Antov Gap a few hours ago.

Diplomatic relations between the Romulan Empire and the Federation have been stable since the end of the Dominion War. Hopefully my crew doesn't cause a diplomatic incident that leads to another Federation/Romulan war. I would definitely lose my command.<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Four hours ago, Federation sensors detected a Romulan vessel in the Antov Gap: 170 light years from the Neutral Zone. Based on the sensor logs they sent us, this is an odd one.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** The ship was not detected crossing the border, or travelling through any of the surrounding sectors. At the moment, Starfleet isn't sure whether this is a sensor glitch, or an actual incursion into Federation territory.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I want everyone on their best behavior...<br />
*Commander Bachar looks at Murry and Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Yes Commander.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** You better not be covered in baby oil under that uniform, I don't want to your naked ass to start another intergalactic war<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Commander, if this is an incursion from a ship that is capable of significant cloaking abilities and modernized in any capacity, what are our orders?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I'd think the Romulans would rather appreciate a naturalist, as there's no place to hide weapons.<br />
*Hailey Murry scoots away from Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Maybe that stark honesty just threatens them.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Because the Lister is not going to fare well if we have to engage in combat against a Romulan Warbird.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis of the sensor records indicate a smaller vessel<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** I agree with Skig, if it's a warbird looking for a fight, its going to paste us<br />
**Commander Bachar:** For now, our orders are to confirm if this is even a real incursion into Federation space<br />
**Commander Bachar:** And ask them nicely to leave<br />
**Commander Bachar:** If they blow us, that will be someone elses problem to deal with<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: blow us up*</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Why don't we have an inflatable Lister to send in?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** If we can nail the diplomacy, then we can hopefully avoid it being anyone else's problem<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Though the fact that the ship wasn't seen coming into the system is quite strange<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Do we have any theories?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps a new cloaking technology, traditional cloaking would have been detected by the tachyon grid along the Neutral Zone<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** How was this one detected?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Based on these sensor logs, it simply appeared at its present location<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** No warp signature, no cloaking distortion detected. Highly unusual.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** How long has it been sitting there?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Foru hours<br />
**Commander Bachar:** No signs of activity<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** No heat, no gravimetric, no ladar, nothing?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Maybe their fancy new cloak blew up in their faces<br />

*Skig , unlike Zox, does not determine that the Romulans have covered their cloaking system with a thick layer of fondant and cherries.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Whatever it is, we'll know soon enough. ETA is just a few minutes out. Captain, should we return to our stations?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Oh yes, of course<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Perhaps one of those mysterious dimensional deities has given their captain a moral question that can only be resolved through a contrived sequence of events.<br />
*Commander Bachar nudges the captain's shoulder*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Dismissed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Is there anything of interest in the system? <br />
>The crew return to the bridge and the Twins pull up the Romulan ship on the viewscreen<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Nothing of parcilar note. It is a standard G-type binary star, four bodies, none habitable<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The last time it was surveyed was decades ago<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, I guess we should do a new survey sweep and update the records<br />
>As the viewscreen comes to life, the vessel that appears is clearly not a Romulan Warbird. It is much smaller in size, and lacking any apparent weaponry. <br />

>The vessel has no running lights visible, no sign of power, and is slowly tumbling through space nose-over-tail.<br />

*Zox softly wootles the tune of 'who could it be now'*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Try hailing them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** I doubt that will work ma'am, they've clearly lost power<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think that's definitely a +1 for Malat's suggestion<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Can we do a scan of everything else in the system to see if they got zapped? That incident with the village that Zox destroyed has me a bit nervous<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Good idea<br />

<img src="../images/auto/tekal.png" alt="Subcommander Tekal" width="50" height="50">**Subcommander Tekal:** We have some Romulan ale in the mess<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That is fascinating Dr. However, I surmise that if you transport out of this vessel without addressing the distortion of curvature, you too will be scrombled as we are.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Oh I seriously doubt that, if your transporter confinement beam got tangled up in the spatial distortion from our singularity core, your atoms would be spread across the next light year of space<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** For now, let's assume the transporters are unreliable. Skig, can you have someone on your team run a diagnostic?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** If we have a problem with the transporters, we should rule out our own equipment before we worry about spatial anomolies<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Excellent. In any case... did you lose power when the signularity struck the curvature or when the Chatara exited from the singularity into Federation space?<br />
*Skig connects back to the Lister.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Oh, it was incredible. One of the objects appeared in engineering around the singularity, all of a sudden the ship was thrown violently through space. Our sensor readings were gibberish, no stellar fix, no nav data, nothing.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** T'Kor, I need you to run a level 1 full diagnostic on the transporters, we had a transporter accident and need to verify if there is an issue with the system or this was caused by proximity to the spatial anamoly.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** We had no idea where we were, and the more we tried to go to warp the worse it got. I cut all the power feeds and then we came to a stop.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Also, verify that the Romulan ship is still held by our tractor beam.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That's a miracle you ended up anywhere recognizable. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/tekal.png" alt="Subcommander Tekal" width="50" height="50">**Subcommander Tekal:** Forgive the young Dr for her enthusiasm, she does not know when to shut up.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So the powerless state on your ship is self-inflicted and you can restore power easily once you determine the impact the anamoly is having on your system?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** looks at Tekal with one of those, "Oh, you have one of those in your crew also" looks?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/tekal.png" alt="Subcommander Tekal" width="50" height="50">**Subcommander Tekal:** Hopefully, as long as Dr V'Lora did no permanent damage in her zeal to cut power<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** We can't restore power until we un-stick this thing from our singularity drive<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Unless we want to be flung out of the known galaxy!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I'd like to take a look at this thing as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Subcommander, I would be happy to check your engineering relays and power systems to verify they can be restored at will when it is determined to be safe.<br />
>Dr. V'Lora giddily leads the away team to the engine room. It is a short walk, as the ship is quite small boasting only a handful of labs and research areas, and a crew quarters area.<br />

>In engineering, Dr. V'Lora opens the hatch to the singularity drive core, instead of the hot white glow of antimatter falling into the singularity, you see a large pulsating mass of brownish-gray matter. It's shape and size are fluctuating from one moment to the next, occasionally a second or third small object will appear near the first, rapidly fluctuate in shape and size, and either merge into the main one or dissapear<br />

<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** I doubt it would interract with the antimatter at all, in order for antimatter to anihilate with ordinary matter it needs to interact with its own anti-particle<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** But this object is made of completely different... stuff<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Subcommander, do I have your permission to perform an engineering check of your power systems and relays to ensure they are capable of being powered back on safely once the issue with the singularity core is resolved?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** It doesn't correspond to any of the known degrees of freedom of ordinary matter fields<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** We need to focus on our current situation and hope that things don't get too out of hand there<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Do we have any theories about what these things are?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, we can try setting up a spectrum scanner to see if there is some sort of repeatable pattern on the theory *they* - if *they* are actually a creature and sentient, are trying to communicate with us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** We have encountered energy beings before, perhaps we can look for patterns.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Good thinking, see what you can put together<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** But I will accept other ideas that might get a result faster.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Methinks they just want to balance between waves and particles. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So finding equilibrium in their existence, which is somehow thrown off by the singularity's existence?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Do you suppose there might be a way to split them from the singularity if it is causing "interference" for lack of better terms?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Either that or they are shifted half into subspace which accounts for them losing more mass as they gain more energy....<br />

>First Officer's log, Stardate 61797.4: I haven't seen Skig for the past hour, we can just hear her crawling Murry's body around through the maintenance hatches and muttering about Zox and Viraseti. In the meantime, Viraseti and Dr. V'Lora have been locked in an office reviewing the data they gathered with Zox. I have been in the bridge, and so far we are completely unable to determine our location, or the bearing to the Lister.

>And as if all that wasn't bad enough, the Voth sense of smell is incredibly sensitive. I always thought Zox was full of shit when he would sniff the air. But this is a small, crowded ship, and the air filtration has been running in low power mode for hours...

>So: situation normal I suppose.<br />

>INTERIOR - Romulan Vessel: As main power flickers back online, Skig slithers out of a maintenance hatch as Lt. Commander Viraseti calls the crew together to share the findings that she and Dr. V'Lora have been working on.<br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): New an entirely new vocabulary, twice over.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): need*</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Our current situation notwithstanding, Commander Zox's plan to probe the objects directly did yield an incredible amount of data. I have been analyzing it with the help of Dr. V'Lora, and we found something very interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Throughout all of our readings of the objects, the mass is in a constant state of flux. Even stranger, the mass reading is much less than the local gravitational field deflection. This implies some missing mass which are not able to read.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** The key breakthrough that Commander Zox enabled was that, under his probing, the object to underwent a repeated cycle of mass changes. The repetition allowed us to take extremely precise readings of the moment-to-moment mass change.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** From those data, we worked out that gravitational energy at any given point in time is explicable by adding the mass reading at that moment, and a non-linear function of the mass readings just before and after that moment, multiplied by a time-based factor.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Based on our findings, we have a hypothesis that we believe explains the objects' behavior, and also potentially where we are.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti listens attentively*<br />
*Skig pulls up a graphic on the monitor*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** This is a 2D facimile of our mystery object<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It appears, undergoes a series of shape and size changes<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** and then vanishes<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** is this....flatland?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It's behavioe is inexplicable until we look from a different angle<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That explains our limited perception of them...any leads on why they are so attracted to the singularity core, or where in space we are?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I'm also curious about where the missing mass comes into play here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So do we need to find a way to rottate them through a four dimensional space to free the ship from its stuck state?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Aha, as the object moves through its additional spatial dimension orthogonally to our own, we can only detect a single 3-dimensional slice of it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** So we are only able to read a tiny slice of the full object<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** However, the rest of the object is still close enough that the rest of its mass causes a deflection of the local spacetime curvature <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** And as for where we are, we have a hypothesis<br />
*Skig places her hand on the surface of the conference table*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Imagine this is us, in our 2-dimensional representation of our spacetime<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Oh! If we use that, we should be able to assess its shape in 4d. Various assumptions could be made for how gravity works through this fourth dimension, but only one should be consistent with our readings...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** The object is moving through the table from above, and if it tugs hard enough....<br />
*Skig moves her hand to the bottom of the table and sticks it to the underside of the tabletop*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Everything we know about subspace tells us that the matter of which we are made is confined to our own 3-dimensional space, but like a 2-D plane has a top and bottom when viewed in 3-D, we hypothesize that we have been "flipped" onto the other side of our 3-D universe<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Ah, like the old theories of wormholes?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Or would this be a separate reality?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Yes, entirely physically distinct from our own<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** With no way to return through ordinary means<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Which is... not great news, now that I say it that way<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But the singularity core here would be 0 dimensions to life from life of any dimensionality?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Yes, I suspect it would be almost imperceptable to these objects<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Is it the one common reference inter-dimensional beings could agree on?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Odd that the only commonality is imperceptible...<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Could we send signals through it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** But it creates such extreme curvature, it would change the way that they iteract with the spacetime fabric around it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** The singularity is effectively just a tiny point of extreme space-time curvature, the only form of signal it can emit is gravitational waves<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Which may be perceptible to whatever this thing is, or may not<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Obviously the only thing we know for sure it reacts to is the EM probing that Zox subjected it to<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Yeah, but it reacted to that by dragging us into another universe<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I think we should definitely use that once more at least<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Maybe not right now, though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Agreed, we need to make sure we get dragged back to where we started<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** When we first encountered the anomoly, it pulled us over 100 light years into Federation space<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** So if we are not careful, who knows where we will end up<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Can we reverse the sequence of EM pulses that Zox used to see if that returns us to our original location in our normal plane of existence?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Ah, was it only activated once?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We could certainly try<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I don't think we should try probing it again until we have some idea of where it is going to dump us<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Are we talking completely "alternate" or the "mirror" universe and the Terran Empire situation we have references to?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** Of course! The mirror universe, our navigational sensors would be unable to determine a positional fix because the stars have been chirally inverted<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Allow me to un-scromble the data!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Ok, so that is the issue of navigation. Second problem: how do we actually steer this thing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Because I don't want to rely on pure luck that we end up back where we started<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Okay, then we can collectively use our knowledge of the star charts, inverted to match the gravitational anomalies of the transference that cause transport to the Mirror Universe and follow the curvature of the splines back to our home, right?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ah ha! I just need to adjust the anti-hadoop distortion and adjust for a differential displacement of mass, as if a slight variable had changed in the big bang....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The computer should be generating and annotating a map shortly....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Additionally, if we are in the Mirror Universe, given our limited knowledge of it and the fact the last known contact involved knowledge of the collapse of the Terran Empire and civil war engufling what we would consider "Federation Space" we need to make sure we are maintaining a very low profile to avoid drawing the attention of something that can torpedo us to oblivion.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Agreed, let's focus on getting ourselves safely back to where we started without that happening<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** And I would prefer to get back sooner rather than later, the last we saw the Lister it was steaming off towards Starbase 34 and I am pretty worried about what is going on there<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Do we have a way to head the Lister off?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I must raise an objection; any technology we could bring back to our own home universe would be of immense import to both the Romulan Empire and Federation. We have a duty to discover.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Well if our warp engines were working we could plot a parallel course in this spacetime, but we can't with this thing hooked on us and we can't get it detached until after it drags us back to our own universe<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Do we have a way to drag it in a direction of our choice, though?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Hmm, good thinking<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The singularity engine!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vlora.png" alt="Dr. V'Lora" width="50" height="50">**Dr. V'Lora:** That will require some very precise calculations<br />
**Commander Bachar:** We know which way the Lister jumped, if we have a clear destination along that route, it'll be much easier to get help than if we warp back to our time and potentially have a broken ship.<br />

>First Officer's log, Stardate 61799.2: If we can't get out of here soon, this away mission may have no survivors. Voth scales are (apparently) incredibly itchy, and I am not sure how much more of this body I can take before I completely lose it.

>In the meantime, Skig insists that she has to remain slightly buzzed at all times in order to keep Murry's body functioning, even though that sounds absurd on its face. Regardless, she has gotten paranoid about running out of Romulan ale.

>And as if that wasn't bad enough:

>Viraseti has modified a laser welding drone into a hair removal robot to trim Skig's beard as it grows in real-time, which seems highly dangerous;
> Murry is... well, let's call that one a private problem;
> And Zox somehow lost Viraseti's uniform pants;

>Honestly I have no idea how he did that, this is a small ship. It is truly a fool's errand to try to keep that man fully dressed for an entire mission.

>In summary: situation normal.<br />

>INTERIOR - Romulan Research Vessel: Lt. Commander Viraseti and Dr. V'Lora are hard at work programming their course into the makeshift navigation system that Zox and Skig rigged up. Commander Bachar has pulled Zox, Skig and Murry into a quiet corner to discuss their plans after they intercept the Lister.<br />

*Zox Sneezes while attempting to wootle the wootle of happiness at solving the Math Puzzle(TM).*<br />
*Zox begins gnawing at anything green.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Alright, Viraseti tells me she and Dr. V'lora will be ready to execute this insane plan in half an hour<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Alright, Viraseti tells me she and Dr. V'lora will be ready to execute this insane plan in half an hour<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Any suggestions on what we are planning to do when we intercept the Lister?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I suggest we ask the nice Romulans to stay cloaked and perform Orient, Observe, Decide, Action loops. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** If only this were a warship with a cloaking device<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Good news, I have figured out how to adjust the Romulan replicators to generate a high enough grade of fermented soybeans that each of these 100g bars contains seven times the legal maximum of alcohol found in Romulan Ale. I can finally get this annoying buzz out of my head AND stop the hand shaking.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Skig, if you poison my body to death while you're inside of it, nobody will be left to care for the Lister<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Fermented? Oh wow. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Dr. Zerra can clone you a new liver when we get back<br />
**Commander Bachar:** The hand shaking is entirely psychosomatic, and the buzz is tinitus<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Assuming we get back<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well, we still do not know how to unscromble our neural engrams. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** And for that matter, there is no gaurantee that the Lister will even respond to our hails. We don't know why they abandoned us in the first place<br />
**Commander Bachar:** The easiest way to unscramble them would just be using the Lister's teleporters, so hopefully this can solve itself when we reunite<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I assume that T'Kor and Gra'lan will have dissected the transporter room by now and have a good situation report of what happened and a remedy.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Honestly, I'm mostly worried about the fact that the more times Tellerite hair is cut, the faster and thicker it grows.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Yes ma'am, sir. No way. Involved in what? Is it good or bad?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** It is good.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart:** Don't worry about it little one, it's all good<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** I'm sure you're both tired from your trip, the computer can help you find your quarters. Ensign Ghex, get some rest. I expect you to report for your shift on the bridge tomorrow morning as scheduled<br />
*Ensign Ghex salutes so hard she bounces up in the air a little bit*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Yes Ma'am! Sir!<br />
*Ensign Ghex looks around for a moment for the door before running over to it, then turning back and saulting again before scuttling off down the hall to find her quarters*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Were any of you ever that young?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Yes, by then I had killed at least 200 people and was trained in 14 methods for sensuous murder.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** According to legend, I was carved from the original warp core of the Lister. I believe that is what the engineers whisper behind my back.<br />

*Skig is going to adjust.... slowly... to this first officer thing. (Based on whispers to Fen).*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Regardless, everyone should get some rest. Right now we have half a new crew, a crazed chemical terrorist in the brig, and the only concrete lead we have is a track on a probe that may have the Twins on it. We are heading out for Earth first thing in the morning<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Yes Captain.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** I would say something inspiring and hopeful, but I'm not that sort of captain. If you need to be inspired, you're going to have to look elsewhere. The best I can do is to say that I expect all of your best in the coming days and weeks.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** The entire fleet thinks this ship is a laughing stock, let's try not to prove them right<br />

*Skig considers Captain Bachar's first order slightly irrational given the precedent of the last twelve months, but wisely does not say anything.*<br />

*Zox blames the weed.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** And Zox: For your first shift at Ops tomorrow, I expect you to be sobered up and with your pants on<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I'm sure Ghex will bloom into a wonderful and capable Starfleet officer, although I will mention that she needs to use less strawberry body wash lest Throk think she is a walking snack.<br />
