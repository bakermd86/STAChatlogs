>Captain's Log, Stardate 61285.8: Due to extensive, unexplained hull breaches on deck 8 after the Lister's infestation, we have had to divert to the nearest Federation dry-dock facility on Skana-IV to repair the damage.
While the repairs are performed, I have ordered the crew to take some shore leave in the planet's equatorial area.
Most of the crew were happy for the time off, but Commander Skig was... shall we say passionate about overseeing the repairs. I asked Zox to keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn't sneak back onto the Lister to work during her leave.<br />

>INTERIOR - Madau Casino: Zox, Skig and Murry have gone to the casino with Zerra and the twins. Dr. Zerra read some book on Dabo and is convinced he has a perfect system to beat the house. The twins have accompanied him, as they are convinced he does not.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I'm telling you, with the right betting strategy Dabo is actually a very simple game. You two are going to eat your words.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not question that Dabo is a simple game. So simple in fact that we can prove quite easily that the house has a 7% advantage, regardless of your "strategy"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, maybe not regardless of the strategy<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** But you've got to be very careful about that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Correct, you can always give the house a greater advantage<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I hope you lose early and consolidate your loss, otherwise you may confuse luck for skill.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Ye of little faith<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You are correct, we have no faith to speak of<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Oh, sorry, what were we discussing?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Nothing quite breaks the mind better than arriving at something for the wrong reasons.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Gamblin!<br />
*Dr. Zerra places several bets on the Dabo table*<br />
*Skig tries to surrepitiously hide her tricoder's auto-relay of from the Lister's repair terminal.*<br />
*Skig whistles in a very, "I'm guilty and can't even fake hiding it" way.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Do you find this form of recreation enjoyable Commander?<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 speaking to Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Aww, I understand you Skig. But if you want to have some fun with engineering, watch this poor Dr. break a mental circuit. It could be fun!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Dr Zerra, where did you get the funds for this?<br />
**Dabo Girl:** Last call, all bets are final!<br />
*Dabo Girl spins the Dabo wheel*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** It brings out the worst in people I think, but I can't speak for all sentient being in what make them tick.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I doubt Bachar was carrying a disrupter, likely it was one of the Naussicans who broke into her room after they beamed into the hallway.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so we should discuss what to do with Commander Bachar’s credentials. Do we want to disable them entirely or flag them?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Standard procedure would be to honeypot them into a useless location that would trap her account to log her location.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, let’s check these for evidence that may help us figure out where they came from or where they are going.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so whoever took Bachar’s place knew what Dr Malov was researching beforehand.

*Zox Log, Stardate 1337.420

Leisurely browsing on the posh luxuries of Skana-IV has made for a very thorny experience.
It seems the weeds of Commander Bachar's felonious past have sprouted again, forcing us
to pursue her captors. Rather than finding the typical sleazeweasels that inhabit gambling
emporia, we have caught scent of a larger plot involving a changeling, the Orion
Syndicate, and the manufacture of some rather impressive bootleg Ketracel White. After
an explosive research find, we prepare a new away team to find one Orion, Jasanis.
After this mission, I must send fresh greens to Rhuk and check in with the Malari authorities
to make sure Neraran is not causing too much trouble.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Hmm... I do remember someone named Jasanis. She is a vile seductress who believes heavily in the "love them and leave them to die in the vacuum of space with a limited amount of oxygen" approach to mating.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Also, she has a slightly modified pheromone signature that tends to cause females to get splitting headaches and behave irrationally, thereby inducing their mates to leave them.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** While it has not been tested much on others, Ketracel White can cause hallucinations in other species, as well as various physical stimulae. I'm not sure it would be incredibly useful as a street drug, but given its highly addictive nature getting people hooked on something hard to produce and therefore expensive would be a possible business opportunity.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** At least, as people like Jasanis consider "business opportunities".<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Well I doubt she plans to start a drug running empire with 800ml of the stuff<br />

*Skig suspects it might have something to do with a reactor overload at a nearby station though.*<br />
