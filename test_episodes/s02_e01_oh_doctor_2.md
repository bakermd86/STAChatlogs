<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Inconvenient. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Look on the bright side: at least your density no longer fluctuates with temperature. How do you replicate clothes that fit if your size relative to your mass changes every day based on the environmental controls? <br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): I think we should do a scan of the rest of the crew, just in case. We can pass it off as being just routine post-Neraran check to make sure they didn't get infected with a biological weapon</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Reason / Medicine again then, as an ETC to see how long it will take to complete</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Curious, I mean, it would be interesting to extract it for further examination, but I'm not entirely sure what that would do to people, as we are not entirely sure what it is.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Don't be silly, standard operating procedure under the Starfleet manual of ship operations is to set environmental controls between 17 and 25 C depending on local environmental conditions if in orbit of a planet. So even when environmental controls are working normally, there is (in fact) a significant range of available temperatures available to the operations officer to set. <br />
*Kolea pats Ghex on the head and gives her a Rubik's Cube to play with.*<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): With that ETC check, Kolea is asserting dominance of, "Yes, I run this Sickbay with extreme efficiency, even when wearing bunny slippers and skin tight clothing."</font><br />
>Over the course of a few hours, Kolea and Krepeka rotate the entire crew through Sickbay to run brain scans on all 400 of them. People are confused why Dr. Zerra is assisting Nurse Kolea instead of the other way around, but by converting several med bays into neurological scanners, they are able to complete the process very quickly<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I am even less confused about how transporters work with brain structures. I'd say my brain is jelly after today, but that'd just be nostalgic.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** ...but this is still confusing.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Well Lt Cmdr Murry and Captain Bachar, as you asked to have this scan performed and it is relevant, I believe it is important to report that everyone who went through the body swapping process has this strange nodule, including the Captain, which seems to be in a semi-solid state in your otherwise fluidic body, captain.<br />
*Kolea is telling this specifically to Murry and Captain Bachar, by themselves, in a faraday sealed room, FYI.*<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Are the nodules in Zerra and Krepeka the same size as the rest of ours? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Yeah, they all look pretty much identical </font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** That's damned odd<br />
*Captain Bachar pulls out a PADD*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I concur.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Also, can we get Chief Engineer T'Kor to figure out why the D-Batteries I get from my replicator only last about 30 minutes? You know, for reasons.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Not really relevant, but I just thought of it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** No, I would rather he figure out whether that device he discovered in the transporters could have caused these <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** No problem, it can wait.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I think that would be a good avenue of investigation after this.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Dr. Zerra's official report on Murry's condition from back then says: "The mechanism by which the cosmic string caused Lt. Commander Murry and Lt. Elin's brainwaves to become entangled is still unknown, further research may be needed"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Given his actions, I wonder now if he is being entirely honest there<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** This guy is just sloppy, overwhemled by the gravity of the whole situation.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Oh wait...<br />
*T'kor skitters into the room with a pile of reports*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I've finished that report for you, sir<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I suspect some method other than the cosmic string would be the resultant factor - which leads me to suspect we might want to unseal and further research the events of that particular situation if Murrey concurs.<br />
*T'kor hands Kolea a pile of reports labeled "D-Crisis"*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Goddamnit T'Kor, did you really think that was important enough to work on right now?<br />
*Kolea looks at reports and is annoyed to discover that her Orion Syndicate "Stress Relievers" are too powerful for wimpy Starfleet D-Batteries.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I guess I should have bought one of the gas powered pull start options on Empok Nor.<br />
*Kolea pauses.*<br />
*Dr. Zerra is puzzled at using primitive chemistry to produce a current.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I think a censor just fell over dead, and I was not even specific. This new time slot is interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I was told it was of top importance. Also, I have recommendations on a variety of methods for alternative power sources and diagrams for how to modify the device for up to three times as much output<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Don' do it! We need a nurse!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Excellent. I would hug you if it would not be lethal to both of us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I'll be looking into this device next, it's quite curious<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Now that this, ahem, mostly unimportant situation is resolved, the Captain was curious about your investigations into the strange device located in the Transporter Room.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Please say it's fixed and you can get me back to normal!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Wait, I mean get ME back to normal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** T'Kor, put investigation on Kolea's "devices" on hold and see what you can find out about the device you found in the transporter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** At a minimum: I would like to find a way to put Krepeka back into her own body<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** To be honest, keeping Neraran in a bowl of semi-frozen lime jello is the best way to keep her under control.<br />
*Zox Walks in...*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Having reviewed her personnel file, her not having arms or legs seems beneficial to the rest of us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, at the very least we have a way of checking if someone has been body swapped<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Imma have to say, no, we need to subject Neraran to....interrogation.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): I tell you, who came up with such a freaking psychopathic lunatic of a character?  Oh... wait...</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Well speaking of Neraran... Her attorney filed a motion for her charges to be handled by JAG on Earth, rather than here on the Lister. So when we get back, we are going to have to remand custody<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** What? That's not good!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** They can't be trusted with this.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I am curious how she was assigned an attorney at all, given that she has not had access to any sort of communication equipment, or even a head, since I trapped her goo form in a refrigerator.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Can't we just keep Neraran's mind in some strange body and hand over a fake?<br />
*Kolea looks at Dr Zerra.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Under regulations, even she is entitled to a fair trial. Her attorney argued that she can't get an impartial judgement in a field hearing overseen by a captain who she tried to kill barely a week earlier<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** No offense to your normal state of existence of course.<br />
*Captain Bachar narrows her eyes at Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** I don't think Krepeka would be OK with facing charges on her behal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** So T'kor, can you get me back?<br />
*Kolea smiles politely to Bachar.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think I meant to put Neraran's mind into like, the pet cat, and then hand over a husk of Zerra with a cat-brain in it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I can... I can try, but it would have to be in place of looking into the device I found<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I can... I can try, but it would have to be in place of looking into the device I found<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** That one is easy Kolea, we were docked at a Starbase undergoing repairs and we had someone in custody in the brig. I had no choice but to file criminal charges in order to explain the detention<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I see. Did you state that Neraran or Dr Zerra was in the Brig?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Starfleet is very pendactic in their application of laws.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** I said there are "inexplicable circumstances" surrounding the accused<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Strangely there is a checkbox on the form to indicate that the body and mind are different individuals<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): (pendantic)</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Starfleet seems to have run into this sort of thing before. <br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Regarding Zox's suggestion: I think Zox and T'kor will have to make opposing Presence checks to see which use of T'Kor's time Bachar thinks is better</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Curious, well, then if we want to interrogate her, we need to put her back, which I believe will require an understanding of the machine T'Kor needs to look into.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Ah, I believe this is related to Hailey's experiences. It looks like the device has dozens of cosmic strings that are quantum bonded together. It's partnered with a pattern interferometer <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So they are using the cosmic strings to mic up brain patterns? I guess that explains why we ended up back in our own bodies when we slingshotted the blackhole<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** That seems a terribly circuitous way to do so.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Exactly. Though I believe that Hailey's experience of being thrown back in time is a more novel one. I believe that sort of report is one which may add more to our understanding of these strings. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** But why does it cause the strange anomaly in the brain pattern that seems to apply across all species exposed to it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Is the string applying some sort of temporal effect that marks people exposed to it across their brain patterns on a permanent basis?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well, I don't know what exact it is we are detecting in the brain, but a cosmic string is not just going to attach itself to your brain of its own accord. They must be anchoring it somehow<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** How did Hailey get hers? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Let me see these scans.....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Per Dr Zerra's notes, it was caused by her and her crewmate being exposed to the cosmic string, perhaps in a way "fusing" them together.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** As in, perhaps this is some sort of "anchor"?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Whatever they experienced was a 1 in a million random chance. For a cosmic string to get stuck on their brain tissue is possible, but extremely unlucky<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Unless changeling body structure acts as a sub-atomic anchor from all the re-arranging.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Based on Kolea's scans, this device seems to be an attempt to controllably replicate what happened, but in a more complete way<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Koron must have been involved in this, he researched Murry's brain scans after her incident<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** He claimed that the findings were "inconclusive"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Well we should speak to this Koron and find out what he and Zerra discovered<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** T'kor, you are positively on fire with that reasoning.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Thank you, Zox. But the scale of my wit is nothing compared to yours<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** T'Kor, you are positively adorable.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Well based on what you're telling me: this device doesn't have an undo function. How do we put Krepeka back into her own body?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** And you'll need to come up with something soon, we will be back at earth in less than a day<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Barbarically? We get Gra'lan to go find a punch card backup of Krepeka, filter the brain patterns out of it, then use a Vulcan mind transference ritual to move the consciousness from Dr. Zerra's body to the blank one, leaving Dr Zerra's body in a vegetative state.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, we could loop near a black hole<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Actually, that would be disasterous. That would almost certainly loop Neraran back into her own body. We'd gain Zerra, but lose the chemical warfare specialist<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Yeah I don't love the idea of releasing Neraran back into the wild in her own body again<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I like that one Kolea!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Could we not simply have them teleport together? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We could try, but it would be highly dangerous and experimental. The device would probably attach a second cosmic string, resulting in an unpredictable outcome<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I mean, there is a Shanat Korr device that rends brain patterns from people and displaces them into a transient form that results in them experiencing constant neural fire to nonexistent nerve endings until they can be projected back into a suitable host corpse for furhter interrogation. But I doubt we would have access to that, since it is outlawed every where except for suspected traitors of the Tal'Shiar.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** But hey, I could always ask nicely?<br />
