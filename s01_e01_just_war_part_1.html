<font color="##261A12">Captains log, Stardate 61062.5: While en-route to the Spora Nebula to begin our survey operations, we recieved an unusual subspace mesage. The inhabitents of the planet Osala requested Federation assistance to mediate a cease-fire talk between two warring factions.&#13;&#13;The Osalan civilization was once a thriving power in the sector, but more than 100 years of endless war between the Osalan Central Republic and the Northern Front has reduced their civilization nearly to ashes. They probably wouldn't have recognized a more modern vessel as being a Federation design, so at least that is one advantage the Lister has over the Akiras and Sovereigns of the fleet.&#13;&#13;We will be meeting with the representatives of both factions to begin negotiations today.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">INTERIOR - Bridge: It has been several hours since Captain Baras and Counselor Murry began negotiations with the Osalans. Since then, the shouting and table pounding from the briefing room have gotten progressively louder.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Commander Bachar: That's it, I need to know what is going on in there</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Commander Bachar pipes the comms audio through to the bridge</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: I'm not sure how to say this, but the situation clearly skinks. </font><br />

<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Boosh.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: The Northern Front still occupies the Rolvak valley. I refuse to tolerate a proposed border which leaves Republic territory in your hands!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Utris Vixal: The Central Republic annexed the Rolvak Valley from our people!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: It was undeveloped wilderness when my people tamed it, why should your people benefit from cities built with our sweat and blood!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Utris Vixal: There are no cities left! It is nothing but ruins. Build on my people's land!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The delegates devolve into further shouting</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Captain Baras: Commander Murry... Any suggestions?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Hmm... I notice the Alluvial Damper has reached the Mun Coefficient on the starboard nacelle, I'll just start a level 1 diagnostic on that to make sure we don't have to worry about an issue with expanding the Jool radians.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Commander Bachar: Just do what you can to get the warp core back online, I don't like being stuck at impulse</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Captain Baras looks very uncomfortable with the tone of the negotiations</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Zox 'monitors' the rooms around the delegations for disturbances.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Hailey Murry speaks to Captain Baras on the side as the delegates shout</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Focus: Espionage ]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum</font> [2d20 = 25]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: It sounds like a situation where the two of them could actually work together to rebuild in that situation if they weren't so focused on their peoples' pride</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: If we can find something substantial to distract them from the past, we can get them focused on the future</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Captain Baras: That is an excellent idea Murry. I... am not the most skilled at the &#34;diplomacy&#34; side of the captain's seat</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Captain Baras: Why don't we all calm down and think about the root of the problem. As the commander suggests, this may be an opportunity in disguise. Commander...</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Captain Baras gestures to to Commander Murry to continue</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: Ok, it sounds like the captain is throwing in the towel. Anyone want to bet 1-week's holodeck time that they come to blows?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: Zox, you a betting man? Or.. Woman? Does your species have gender?</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Zox: </font> [d6 = 2]<br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: It wasn't in your file</font><br />

<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: Gender IS a strange concept. Why should your genital shape form the basis for your social divisions</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Generally, we don't try to egg each other on to certain behaviors, that's for the seasons.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Gentlemen, please. I might suggest that this is an opportunity to solve two issues at once. The Northern Front could use the space to settle, while the Republic's economy is in a downturn. I would suggest working together to rebuild and resettle the valley. The increased economic activity and trade would help provide both a home for those in need and economic stimulation to provide for them as they settle. </font><br />

<font color="##880000">Telar Talis and Utris Vixal sit back down and look at Commander Murry</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Lt. Cmdr Viraseti, could you assist me with these sensor scan results?  I believe this is an unusual phenomenon external to the ship which is inhibiting our warp field.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: That is... reasonable</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Utris Vixal: We could accept that compromise</font><br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Tactical.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti looks at Skig's console</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Interesting...</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: There is no obvious source of that warp field, it is almost as though the planet itself is emanating it...</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Captain Baras: Well, that is one issue resolved at least</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Captain Baras: Perhaps we should take a brief rest and get something to eat in the mess?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Captain Baras: It has been a long morning</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: Agreed, I for one am eager to see the rest of this vessel</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Captain Baras leads the delegates out of the briefing room and back onto the bridge</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Commander Bachar quickly cuts off the comms eavesdropping</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (4)]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 1]&#10;Success with 0 momentum</font> [2d20 = 35]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Two security officers walk over to the briefing room door and stand ominously behind the delegates, looking threatening</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: We could try moving out of range and see if the warp field re-estbalishes itself?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Commander Bachar: Agreed. Malat, move us to a higher orbit</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Skig obviously has a Tellarite accent for certain words.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Zox has a bit of a hissssy fit in ordering some security personel.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Skig: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (3)]&#10;[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 0 momentum</font> [2d20 = 31]<br />
<font color="##880000">Hailey Murry pulls the security officers back several steps to give them some breathing space, adjusting their positions so they're not looming menacingly so much as actually  standing guard</font><br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Man, I sorta wish they had given them a triceratops head and then I could smash into things to challenge a klingon to Bat'leth.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Captain Baras suddenly vanishes into a flash of light while crossing the bridge to the turbolift</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Commander Bachar: Yellow Alert! Zox, raise shie...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Commander, I do not think we should continue our ascent as the warp field suppression seems to be...</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Before she can finish her order, Commander Bachar vanishes as well</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Zox, I believe she wanted you to raise Shields.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: The delegates!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Shields up! Run a trace on all transporter beams!</font><br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Maybe we should have established Chain of Command if both the Captain and XO vanished in a beam of light.</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Hailey Murry: [ DARING  (11) +  COMMAND  (1)]&#10;[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]&#10;Failed on DC: 1</font> [2d20 = 34]<br />

<font color="##261A12">Commander Murry issues confusing orders to the security officers in the heat of the moment</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Zox: </font> [d20 = 12]<br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox runs a scan, but finds that there is no residual transporter energy at all</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Hailey Murry gesticulates wildly to the two guards</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: It isn't a transporter! Skig, the war...</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti vanishes mid-sentence</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Leapin Lizards! What's happening?!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: There is no reason to panic Zox.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: We believe the Lietenant Commander was attempting to say that the dissapearances are related to the warp interference</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Have you raised the shields? And were the shields up prior to Viraseti's disappearance?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: The energy signature does not match a transporter, it matches a jump to warp</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: That seems likely 11 and 10.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: The shields should be up now, and no they were not up in an attempt to show good will with the ambassators on board.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Right, so bring the ship back to its original orbit to see if the warp field instability from the interference field generated by the planet stabilizes.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Thank you Zox.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: Aye sir</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Lt. Malat pilots the Lister back to its lower orbit</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: A jump to warp? Why are crewmen being jumped to warp? </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Murry, as the diplomatic one, can you ensure the safety of the diplomats and see to their disposition while we look into this situation?</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Skig performs a sensor scan on the warp field to determine what is going on.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: The field energy from the warp disturbance is returning to normal levels. I can form a supposition that whatever is controlling this warp inhibitor field wants us to remain in a lower orbit.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Zox, can you perform an internal scan to see how many crew have disappeared from this warp-transporter situation?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Aye-Aye.</font><br />

<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: I am certain that this is some sort of Northern Front deception!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: 170 of the crew are missing, Skig.</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Skig has called a meeting of the remaining senior staff to investigate the warp field interference and the crew's dissapearance</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: While nothing can be discounted, let us consider the high likelihood that neither of your peoples are capable of this level of technical sophistication.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Thank you Zox.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Utris Vixal: Hah! Sounds like hte unhigned accusations of the Central Republic!</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Skig looks at the delegates.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Utris and Telar nearly come to blows before the security officers separate them</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Murry, can you escort these two to the brig? I think the situation will get the best of them.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Delegates, please. We'll get to the bottom of this in no time. This sort of circumstance can happen without any malefactors. Meanwhile, come with me and I'll arrange for some lunch. </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Sirs, while I can appreciate the fear of the unknown when presented unknown information, please consider whether your technical skills would be capable of the observed behavior.</font><br />

<font color="##880000">Zox appears to appreciate Skig's wisdom.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The delegates calm own and follow Commander Murry</font><br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): edit later</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: No unusual activity occured prior to crew becoming missing.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Hailey Murry steeples her fingers as she leans forward</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: Sensor scans revealed no signs of nearby vessels</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: When did we start getting the warp interference? </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: What has been determined so far is that a warp inhibitor field is preventing the Lister from forming a warp field. Attempting to move to higher orbit activated a response from the warp field that caused a spike in energy emissions as well as the mass disappearance of crew through what looked like warp field transference.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10: It seems highly unlikely that such a phenomenon is naturally occurring</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: The interference began shortly after we entered low orbit.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: It is definitely not naturally occuring, as this does not appear in previous surveys of the planet.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Can you create some way to stabilize the interference?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Skig shrugs.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: I'm with Zox, I would certainly feel better if we had the warp drive online</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Perhaps, there are a multitude of approaches we could take. I believe we need to identify the source of the phenomenon. We could look into the feasbility of offseting the interference by modulating our own field.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Is it possible that there's some sort of atomic phenomena interfering with the warp fields? (Hypothesis)</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: I cannot compete with your brain, but I think I know who to ask some questions. I will interrogate the diplomats with Lt. Rhoda. </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: It looks like both the Northern Front and the Central Republic have begun to look into the Rolvak Valley recently for the first time in a hundred years. I wonder if there's something in the valley itself which could be causing this. (Hypothesis: Rolvak Valley)</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Yes, I am curious if this was caused by the activity in the Rolvak Valley. Perhaps new technologies or weapons used there triggered some latent and previous inactive ancient defense mechanism.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Ah. Good. Something to inquire about.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: That would explain why it was triggered when we tried to move to a higher orbit</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: The current inhabitants of this world do not have the technical skill to achieve this, but I previously encountered problems on Preserver planets that had a similar impact.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: They might not knowingly have access to that level of technology, but there might be something forgotten that someone has activated. By mistake or intent. </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: I agree. I believe we should look into the Rolvak Valley as both the cause and location point of this issue. We should start with that.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Zox nods in agreement. </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: I think we must first gather some information before beaming down, especially given the uncertainty of the warp anomaly. I cannot put our away teams at risk without prudence.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: I agree, we have no idea what is down there</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Allow me a quick...discussion with our diplomats.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Therefore, we should approach it from a multidisciplinary approach. Murry, can you and Zox discuss with the delegates, separately if they are worried about &#34;national secrets&#34; their technical level, as well as any strange phenomenon they might have observed around the Rolvak Valley and in general.  Lt. Malat, 11/10, and I will work on sensor and scan sweeps of the Rolvak Valley to see if we can pinpoint the source of the disturbance, as well as sensor scans of the planet to determine if our missing crew have been transported somewhere.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Let's check with each of the delegates individually and get their side of how development and exploration of the valley has been occuring</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Perhaps you should try first Hailey. I have been accused of being cold to guests.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">INTERIOR - Crew Quarters: Zox and Commander Murry head to Telar Talis' quarters to get her side of the story</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: What is going on ou there? I demand to speak to the captain!</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Hello again, Ambassador Talis! Our captain is currently predisposed at the moment, but I'll let him know as soon as possible. In the meantime, I wanted to see if we can get started on some background so the Central Republic can get the most benefit out of the situation (Insight+Conn with Bureaucracy; relying on decorum as she asks about the current situation in the valley to better set up the treaty)</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Hailey Murry: [ INSIGHT  (12) +  CONN  (3)]&#10;[Focus: Bureaucracy ]&#10;[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]&#10;Success with 3 momentum</font> [2d20 = 3]<br />

<font color="##880000">Telar Talis calms down and gives Commander Murry some of the relevant history</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Zox stares at Telar Talis in dinosaur.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: My people built the valley from the ground up. When we claimed that land, the Northern Front was content to leave it wholly undeveloped.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: It was a unique opportunity to use nearly limitless geothermal power to build a city of the future.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Limitless?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: But the Northern Front would not accept our rightful claim on the land!</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: Our records indicate that our people built a great geothermal power extractor and used its energy to power the entire city</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: We have lost many records of that era, but if our archives are to be believed, it would have been a thing of beauty</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Telar Talis: Before the Northern Front laid siege to the city from orbit and reduced it to ruins</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Zox smiles at the mention of geothermal power, it's like a big heat rock.</font><br />
