>Captains log, Stardate 61062.5: While en-route to the Spora Nebula to begin our survey operations, we recieved an unusual subspace mesage. The inhabitents of the planet Osala requested Federation assistance to mediate a cease-fire talk between two warring factions.&#13;&#13;The Osalan civilization was once a thriving power in the sector, but more than 100 years of endless war between the Osalan Central Republic and the Northern Front has reduced their civilization nearly to ashes. They probably wouldn't have recognized a more modern vessel as being a Federation design, so at least that is one advantage the Lister has over the Akiras and Sovereigns of the fleet.&#13;&#13;We will be meeting with the representatives of both factions to begin negotiations today.

>INTERIOR - Bridge: It has been several hours since Captain Baras and Counselor Murry began negotiations with the Osalans. Since then, the shouting and table pounding from the briefing room have gotten progressively louder.

Commander Bachar: That's it, I need to know what is going on in there
*Commander Bachar pipes the comms audio through to the bridge*
