**Security Officer:** No one move! Security systems detected a shapeshifter infiltration!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Shapeshifter went out the window, but sure, have us all stand here while the murderous Shapeshifter who disintegrated Dr. Malov gets away.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so we should discuss what to do with Commander Bachar’s credentials. Do we want to disable them entirely or flag them?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Standard procedure would be to honeypot them into a useless location that would trap her account to log her location.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, let’s check these for evidence that may help us figure out where they came from or where they are going.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** This is unusual. Both Naussicans have signs of low level radiation poisoning<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did it get the chance to print anything?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The log indicates it printed approximately 800ml of something<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We may be able to reconstruct the chemical signature from the encoded memory files if the buffer was not cleared, which it might not have been if it was in the printing process when we interrupted them.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** After feeding the voice signatures through an extensive database, I have determined that a wanted Orion Criminal by the name is Jasanis is in cahoots with this shapeshifter.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so whoever took Bachar’s place knew what Dr Malov was researching beforehand. They definitely did the secret duplication of shapechanger goo, you can see her apply it here and one of her goons activate the machine behind the doctor’s back.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox, if we know we are looking for an Orion woman named Jasanis, would this be a good time to initiate a planetwide security scan to locate all Orion pheromone signatures?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** These printers were being used to research production on Ketracel White, so anything specific to the Starfleet’s research of the drug would need this specific machine<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That doesn’t make any sense, why would a founder need to co-opt Federation research on Ketracel White? The Founders already produce the stuff, they invented it!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Perhaps to stop our research into it? I doubt this is being done in the spirit of cooperation with the Federation to liberate the Gem-Hadar from their dependency on the Founders.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wish Neraran was here. This would be a puzzle she’d be most adept at piecing together.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Zox, you’re in command here. Bring in whatever other personel you need and find that shapeshifter. If I lose my first officer, you're all getting demoted<br />
>And now, the conclusion<br />

*Zox Log, Stardate 1337.420

Leisurely browsing on the posh luxuries of Skana-IV has made for a very thorny experience.
It seems the weeds of Commander Bachar's felonious past have sprouted again, forcing us
to pursue her captors. Rather than finding the typical sleazeweasels that inhabit gambling
emporia, we have caught scent of a larger plot involving a changeling, the Orion
Syndicate, and the manufacture of some rather impressive bootleg Ketracel White. After
an explosive research find, we prepare a new away team to find one Orion, Jasanis.
After this mission, I must send fresh greens to Rhuk and check in with the Malari authorities
to make sure Neraran is not causing too much trouble.*<br />

*Skig beams back up to the ship with Captain Baras to bring the Lister back online to assist remotely.*<br />
*Kolea beams down to join the away team after changing out of her bunny suit.*<br />
**Kolea:** Reporting for duty, sir.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Kolea, can you find your own kind by a faint pheremone trail?<br />
*Kolea sniffs the area.*<br />
**Kolea:** Well, if it was not burned too badly, possibly.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it was mostly everything else that got burnt<br />
**Kolea: [ FITNESS  (8) +  MEDICINE  (4)]

**Kolea:** Hmm... I smell a lot of Zox pheromones, they are arousing.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think that was just one of the things that got burnt, Kolea<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think it's just Jurassic Musk. Rhuk gifte it to me in the hopes I wouldn't attract more humans.<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, I do indeed smell the husky odour of a very manly and strong dinosaur.<br />
**Kolea:** That was cooked.<br />
**Kolea:  [d6 = 2]**<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would the name Jasanis ring a bell?<br />
*Kolea gets out medical tricoder and uses it to look for Orion pheromone traces.*<br />
*Zox begins thinking.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** This woman's criminal record makes me look like a model officer<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Sounds like fowl business<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): This is my day to roll 20s. No one ask Skig to do anything with the Lister's power systems!</font><br />

Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 23]**<br />
**Kolea:** I was charged with that once, it involved mistaking chicken based cooking oil for massage oil in a heated room.<br />
**Kolea:** Hmm... I do remember someone named Jasanis. She is a vile seductress who believes heavily in the "love them and leave them to die in the vacuum of space with a limited amount of oxygen" approach to mating.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well darn that's some luck.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...that you know of her, not the poor people she seduced.<br />
**Kolea:** Also, she has a slightly modified pheromone signature that tends to cause females to get splitting headaches and behave irrationally, thereby inducing their mates to leave them.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So complicated. Why can't you just decorate a hole in the ground with vegetation and do the dance of many stomps?<br />
**Kolea:** And she also thinks Starfleet Vessels are piles of floating scrap that should be destroyed.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's it! Nuking the planet from orbit.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** (Just kidding)<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well based on her rap sheet, the only part of a Starfleet vessel she has ever seen is the inside of a brig<br />
*Zox looks for iodone pills in the lab wreckage*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not their best feature if you ask me<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So...what would she be doing kidnapping a Starfleet officer and getting caught up with shapeshifters?<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, the jail cells do not make for very mood appropriate bondage chambers, but they have nice open force fields which allow for performance work without the risk of being slobbered on.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well, she's got a lot of drug charges here. Does Ketracel White have any value as a street drug?<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 13]**<br />
**Kolea:** While it has not been tested much on others, Ketracel White can cause hallucinations in other species, as well as various physical stimulae. I'm not sure it would be incredibly useful as a street drug, but given its highly addictive nature getting people hooked on something hard to produce and therefore expensive would be a possible business opportunity.<br />
**Kolea:** At least, as people like Jasanis consider "business opportunities".<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well I doubt she plans to start a drug running empire with 800ml of the stuff<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She must have some plan to synthesize more<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But she probably has the expertise to make more with these machines.<br />
**Kolea:** I doubt it, but this type of planet would make for a good test bed for "trial runs" of the material as well as increasing production.<br />
*Zox slaps his coms badge.*<br />
**Kolea:** Resort planets are good places to test out new "merchandise".<br />
*Zox Skig. Where on this planet are more of these replicator, fabricator, thing-dingies? The ones that were in this lab. I have these serial numbers and the manufacturers name as well.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig. Where on this planet are more of these replicator, fabricator, thing-dingies? The ones that were in this lab. I have these serial numbers and the manufacturers name as well.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm. So, if they came all the way out here for it, I don't think they've got a supply themselves. How many doses is 800mL of ketracel white? <br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): So 3 out of 8 rolls for me today have been a 20.</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Sorry, the main computer is having issues interfacing with, pretty much anything. Why in the name of Engineering would someone hook the cross-inverse transflux to the primary positronic matrix? I am NEVER taking time off when the Lister need repairs AGAIN.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Thanks Skig. Sorry for the trouble.<br />
**Skig:  [2d6 = 11]**<br />
*Skig beats head against terminal, inflicting 2 points of Stun damage on herself.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay - any ideas on how to find where more of these would be on this planet?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You could use your authority as Chief of Security to ask the planetary government for a list of registered locations for these highly regulated machines?<br />
**Kolea:** You could use your authority as Chief of Security to ask the planetary government for a list of registered locations for these highly regulated machines?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes! Excellent suggestion!<br />

*Skig requests permission to shut off the Lister, disconnect all comm badges, and not be part of this game until the dice rolls become sane. Unless she needs to roll to get approval for that, in which case, cancel the series.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So using the normal dosage of Ketracel White, they took roughly 20 doses of the drug. That's...not a lot. It's quite potentially addictive even with just that, but there's plenty of other drugs that could have been used instead and those are much easier to find. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hello, Security Office? I'd like to run an inventory check on all large scale chemical replicators on planet Skana-4. <br />
**Customer Service IVR:** Thank you for calling The Skana-IV Department of the Interior, Regulated Medical Device Division. Please state the nature of your query so that you can be connected to appropriate representative. For example, you could  say "Billing" or "Register my regulated device"<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Blasted things, I thought humans had banned these after their many world wars.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** give me an operator!<br />
**Kolea:** Unfortunately Counselor, the "newness" and "novelty" of taking "Super Gem Hadar Warrior" drug would be a draw for rich bored Trust Fund Babies.<br />
**Customer Service IVR:** I heard "World wars" would you like to be connected to the Minstry of Planetary Defense?<br />
**Kolea:** Try pressing 0 five times, then press 0420, then press 69.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes! that sounds fantastic!<br />
**Kolea:** You will either get an operator or a pay-per-minute phone sex line.<br />
**Kolea:** Sometimes both.<br />
**Customer Service IVR:** Connecting you now, please stand by<br />
**Ministry of Defense Employee:** Thank you for calling the Skana-IV Ministry of Planetary Defense non-emergency line, if you are experiencing a full-scale planetary invasion, hang up and place an emergy call<br />
**Ministry of Defense Employee:** How may I help you sir<br />
*Zox supplies the model names and numbers of the equipment.*<br />

**Kolea:** No problem sir.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay - the plan before we energize. Haley, you get first crack at him. If that doesn't work, we move to plan B.<br />
**Kolea:** Just let me know when I get to put on my bunny suit and exude pheromones.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Who's the associate?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Anytime you want. =D <br />
**Kolea:** YES! Best away team ever.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** According to the arrest record, he's a Ferrengi smuggler <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Disgusting little trolls...<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So, we are after a Ferengi by the name of K'Tat Denllan. He got busted, but may know more about this sort of equipment.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I see.<br />
**Kolea:** Given how the organization works, it is just as likely Jasanis is using the name to scare people rather than actually working for them. If she is working for them, things may be more complicated than currently expected.<br />
*Kolea shrugs.*<br />
