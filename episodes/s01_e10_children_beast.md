>Captains Log, Stardate 61686.5: Thankfully, our mysterious summons back to Sector 017 was for environmental protection, not another war. I am sure Commander Zox is dissapointed, but I am sure most of the crew is glad not to be dragged back into combat.

Hopefully the crew don't do anything to embarrass me again with the entire fleet gathered in one place. Admiral Ross didn't seem to think much of me during my command competency review... Here's hoping for a smooth week.<br />

*Skig will do everything she can so Captain Baras gets a good command competency review.*<br />
*Skig also wants to make sure the Lister performs superbly.*<br />

>INTERIOR - Zeppalite transport: Murry and Zox's team are situated quite comfortably in a civilian transport for once, after Zox managed to secure something spacious and not-delapidated out of the Starfleet vessel impound lot. They are cruising along at warp 5, heading for the border of Breen space with their forged identity and passage documents.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I mean, realistically, we should probably come up with names, cover stories, and disguises because it is not like at least you and Zox aren't already well-known and blindingly obvious to our quarry.<br />

With so much of the crew transfered back to Earth, the engine room is unusually silent save for the hum of the warp core. The silence of the two socially challenged engineers is interrupted when Commander Bachar slips out of the turbolift accompanied by Zox.<br />

**Commander Bachar:** I assume by now you've reviewed the mission briefing, and you know that comms will be impacted by the radiation<br />
**Commander Bachar:** We have to manually relay communications via shuttle to and from the flagships<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** That sounds like a fine opportunity for trouble to arise<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Yes, although I question why they are asking the communications crews to relay via shuttle instead of using the hyperlink photonic relays built into the ships to transmit morse code via the interpolation of the rear nacelle tracking light and the forward array disks.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** But sure, we can stick people in shuttle craft.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Well be glad that they lack your outside-the-box thinking Commander<br />
*Skig mostly does not want Old Faithless to get damaged.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Because it gives us an excuse to be on Nechayev and Ross' flagships<br />

>INTERIOR - Aldazed Drug Lab: As the screams of workes echo through the halls outside, Dr. Malov seals the door and vents of the room and shrinks into his seat in terror.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov:** This is not an ideal outcome, the last time we had a containment breach we had several deaths, and that was just from one unit breaking containment<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Shall we leave out the window?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Can you state if this is a chemical or biological hazard?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** True?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov:** I can't leave the rest of the workers to fend for themselves, we need to remain united and not bend to pressure from management<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): This stuff is semi-sentient?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov:** Well, the refinement of ketracel white requires some very unstable chemical compounds to react at a controlled rate. The only way to stablize the reaction is with a reagent than can alter its own molecular structure in response to the chemical reaction: changeling morphogenic matrix<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think it's safe to say that management isn't about to cause the current pressure<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov:** This is no different than any other strike breaking effort. Don't you know the history of your own planet? When the west Virginia cola miner's went on strike, management send in the Baldwin-Felts detective agency to kill them. This is no different<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov:** Jasanis thinks she can break the strike by releasing the changling matrices<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** This is significantly different. For example, what happens if those things break out of the facility and get into the city?<br />

**Commander Bachar:** I hope you know what you're doing taking that deathtrap <br />

**Commander Bachar:** Good boy<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Well now that we have dealt with Ensign Geret's lack of good judgement, I have 2 reports for your to deliver<br />
*Commander Bachar hands a pair of PADDs to T'Kor*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Yes, Commander. <br />
**Commander Bachar:** One is Skig's engineering readiness report to be delivered to main engineering on the Excalibur, the other is a requisition for more radiation meds for the Bellerephon<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Once you are on-board, do your best to dig for any evidence about why Ross and Nechayev are so interested in the Lister<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I want to know what the hell is going on here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Understood. Which ships areNacheyev and Ross are aboard?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Nechayev's flagship is the Excaliber, Ross' is the Bellerephon<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Do NOT get caught<br />
*Geret ponders deeply which to visit first, only to get lost in arcane and esoteric thoughts of protocols and regulations.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I would say "use your best judgement" but I don't have a lot of faith in that, so use MY best judgement. If things go south, get out before you're found out<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk:** Throk certain he not stick out like giant solitary Gorn among hundreds of pasty white humans.<br />

*Commander Bachar pulls Geret's commbadge off her uniform and holds it up to her tricorder, tapping in a few keys*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Congratulations, you're Commander Zox again for today<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret:** Yahoooo!<br />
**Commander Bachar:** You turn that back in to me at the end of this mission or I will eat you myself<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Is everyone clear?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Well, Starship computers are highly internetworked so any files on the ship computer itself would be accessible from any terminal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk:** Ensign Tastes-like-Zox will do things that are best not known by rest so we aren't responsible for its death.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret:** As commander of this mission, it is an order that everyone acts your role, so you have to act like the group w bench from the lister - otherwise you will attract attention.<br />

They aren't a natural Bynar pair, their original complementary units are either dead, or missing. A careful technical analysis shows that their network communications are not within normal Bynar parameters<br />

Haggarty:** Zox's Psychological profile from his last medical clearance indicates a high degree of unresolved anger over his lack of direct combat involvement during the war, and a tendency toward agression as a result. It is a profile which makes one susceptible to manipulation, and his previous post at Starfleet Security gave him direct personal access to the suspect, both before and after the attack<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty:** The suspect used a device to rewire a replicator into a point-to-point transporter, and attempted to use it to beam a small explosive into President Inyo's transport while on a tour of a new Starfleet Medical facility on Earth<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty:** But Inyo's security team had to pull him from the transport at the last minute due to a scheduling conflict<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** No you idiot, someone on your ship sold her out<br />
*Hailey Murry rolls her eyes*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** And that would be this "Janus"?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** Yeah, I was working with a broker to try to put a deal together that would make us both a ton of latinum<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** A buyer in the DMZ wants a bunch of exotic particle weapon cells, but the only seller who can provide them isn't interested in money<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** Turns out, the only thing they are willing to trade for is the white, and I'm the only person in the Alpha Quandrant with a chemical refinery and knowledge of how to refine the stuff<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** Trouble is the reaction has to be stabilized in a bath of changeling morphogenic matrix, so I tell the buyer he's out of luck, the stuff is literally impossible to get<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** Until, conveniently, I get a message from someone calling themselves "Janus" who tells me where I can find a hiding changeling, and as if that wasn't convenient enough it's going to be on a planet where the Federation is also, "coincidentally" researching how to synthesize the chemical components of Ketracel White<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** So you tell me girlscout: What do you think the odds are that my buyer is in Starfleet?<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Meaning the buyer of the particle weapon cells, not the buyer of the white itself</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Were you planning on cutting Janus out of the deal and taking all the money, or getting that money to them? <br />
*Zox looks uncomfortable.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** Janus didn't want any money, didn't ask for anything, just started feeding me intel<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** I assume he or she works for my buyers<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** And they are trying to make sure that they get those particle cells<br />
*Hailey Murry glances at Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I really have a feeling that Jasanis needs to find some backwater planet and change her identity real quick<br />
>The conversation is interuppted by the comms crackling to life <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Waaaaay too many people don't like loose ends.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** We should plan accordingly.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/radio.png" alt="Comms voice" width="50" height="50">**Comms voice:** Bridge to Jasanis, we are entering orbit of Porea Synet IV. T'Pau is requesting permission to beam up<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Jasanis.png" alt="Jasanis" width="50" height="50">**Jasanis:** Permission granted<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Curious<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** I can only logically conclude that your efforts to investigate Jasanis' illegal activities have come to a head at a rather unfortunate time<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** We've found it rather convenient, actually<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Hmm<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Well you seem to have all of the leverage here<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** I can only logically conclude that your efforts to investigate Jasanis’ illegal activities have come to a head at a rather unfortunate time<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Logically, the only thing we can do is appeal to your humanity. If you confiscate the Ketracel white, we will die<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Well, this fills in a lot of blanks.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** You may care little for the lives of Jem'Hadar, but we would request that you release Jasanis and leave in peace<br />
*Kolea thinks to herself, "How about we set them up with Dr Malov to mass produce it and keep Jasanis"*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** But we do care.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Your actions suggest otherwise<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Was Jasanis your only source?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** It would be cruel and reptilian to leave you without a source of white.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** As we explained to your Federation previously, we do not want a supplier. We want self sufficiency.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Your Federation was all too willing to "help" us by supplying us with what we needed, but the thought of an independent colony of Jem'Hadar without external control was, logically, concerning to them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Like the Founders, the Federation seeks to control everything<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Ah, and Jasanis was selling more than just the Ketracel White? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Jasanis was willing to do what Starfleet would not: work out the entire production process and share with us her methods, research notes, and engineering challenges<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I respect your drive for self-determination. I am friend to Jem'Hadar, and have once aided First Taran K'lor and his crew. I believe we have an understanding as soldiers, T'Pau.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Your friend Taran K'lor would slaughter us for apostacy if he ever found us here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** And you're familiar with the methods that Jasanis was employing? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Yes, are you?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Our contract with Jasanis included strict limits on her user of violence, much to her annoyance <br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** She contacted us many times requesting permission to kill someone I can only logically assume is you, based on your species, hair color and secondary sexual characteristics<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Interesting. So we indeed are indebeted to you already.<br />
*Kolea looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** To the best of my knowledge, she has killed none of your people<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** In accordance with our agreement<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** But you have killed many of hers<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I'm not sure how he was able to pick up your secondary sexual characteristics?<br />
*Zox eyes back at Kolea*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Some species are a bit more subtle. <br />
*Zox winks*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Also, he doesn't have your hair color right.<br />
*Kolea looks at T'Pau.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** And the slave labor in the factory? The various kidnappings? The bombs on the Lister? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Leaving Jasanis here would put you all in danger.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Ah yes, Jasanis many crimes. From where I am standing, it appears you have committed as many crimes of as much severity, so your attempts to claim the moral highground are not logical or compelling<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Are you not committing a kidnapping as we speak?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** As for the "bombs<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Well, it started out as a kidnapping and drug bust heist, but it started to become apparent that Jasanis might be most safe outside of Federation custody at this point.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Technically, she kidnapped us and we just managed to have a suitably ludicrous combination of events that resulted in a reverse of fortunes.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Jasanis was permitted only to use force as a distraction, per the terms of our agreement. As far as we know, she has never actually blown up the Lister<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Did Jasanis come track you down in your Federation starship? Safely in your Federation space?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** Or did you illegally cross both Breen and Cardassian jurisdictions in order to take her captive against her will in a territory which has no extradition or renditition agreements with your Federation?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** We do not defend Jasanis' methods, we do not like the way she or the Orions operate. But we do not see that your Starfleet has any high moral position to sit in judgement <br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** And logically, even if we trusted you as individuals to keep your word and aid us in our endeavors, you are not free to act as you want<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** You are beholden to the orders of your Starfleet command, and they do not want my people to have the ability to produce our own White<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** So again, logically, I cannot trust you and must instead request that you release Jasanis<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** So that she is free to provide us with the information we require to begin work on our production plans<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Well, for starters, take this shipment.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** They expand their territory, establish new colonies, build weapons of war, and seek every greater control<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** But they did abolish Twitter, so they have that going for them.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** The only difference is that the Federation does it with a smile, and open arms <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I'd say the lack of a slave-race of soldiers is a pretty notable difference as well<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau:** And then you would be court martialled and encarcerated <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** But I see your good point T'Pau. In many ways what white is to you, rhetoric is just as much of a chemical.<br />
