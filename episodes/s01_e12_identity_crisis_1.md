>Captains Log, Stardate 61796.1: We have had to divert from our scheduled mission to the Sybo Nebula to investigate a potential Romulan incursion into Federation space. Commander Bachar is preparing a briefing on the situation, but all we know so far is that a Romulan vessel was detected in the Antov Gap a few hours ago.

Diplomatic relations between the Romulan Empire and the Federation have been stable since the end of the Dominion War. Hopefully my crew doesn't cause a diplomatic incident that leads to another Federation/Romulan war. I would definitely lose my command.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Four hours ago, Federation sensors detected a Romulan vessel in the Antov Gap: 170 light years from the Neutral Zone. Based on the sensor logs they sent us, this is an odd one.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** The ship was not detected crossing the border, or travelling through any of the surrounding sectors. At the moment, Starfleet isn't sure whether this is a sensor glitch, or an actual incursion into Federation territory.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I want everyone on their best behavior...<br />
*Commander Bachar looks at Murry and Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes Commander.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** You better not be covered in baby oil under that uniform, I don't want to your naked ass to start another intergalactic war<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Commander, if this is an incursion from a ship that is capable of significant cloaking abilities and modernized in any capacity, what are our orders?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I'd think the Romulans would rather appreciate a naturalist, as there's no place to hide weapons.<br />
*Hailey Murry scoots away from Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe that stark honesty just threatens them.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Because the Lister is not going to fare well if we have to engage in combat against a Romulan Warbird.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis of the sensor records indicate a smaller vessel<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I agree with Skig, if it's a warbird looking for a fight, its going to paste us<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** For now, our orders are to confirm if this is even a real incursion into Federation space<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** And ask them nicely to leave<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If they blow us, that will be someone elses problem to deal with<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: blow us up*</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Why don't we have an inflatable Lister to send in?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we can nail the diplomacy, then we can hopefully avoid it being anyone else's problem<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though the fact that the ship wasn't seen coming into the system is quite strange<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do we have any theories?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps a new cloaking technology, traditional cloaking would have been detected by the tachyon grid along the Neutral Zone<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How was this one detected?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Based on these sensor logs, it simply appeared at its present location<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** No warp signature, no cloaking distortion detected. Highly unusual.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long has it been sitting there?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Foru hours<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** No signs of activity<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No heat, no gravimetric, no ladar, nothing?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe their fancy new cloak blew up in their faces<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Possibly, although we aren't reading any chronoton emissions either<br />
*Skig , unlike Zox, does not determine that the Romulans have covered their cloaking system with a thick layer of fondant and cherries.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Whatever it is, we'll know soon enough. ETA is just a few minutes out. Captain, should we return to our stations?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh yes, of course<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Perhaps one of those mysterious dimensional deities has given their captain a moral question that can only be resolved through a contrived sequence of events.<br />
*Commander Bachar nudges the captain's shoulder*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Dismissed<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is there anything of interest in the system? <br />
>The crew return to the bridge and the Twins pull up the Romulan ship on the viewscreen<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Nothing of parcilar note. It is a standard G-type binary star, four bodies, none habitable<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The last time it was surveyed was decades ago<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, I guess we should do a new survey sweep and update the records<br />
>As the viewscreen comes to life, the vessel that appears is clearly not a Romulan Warbird. It is much smaller in size, and lacking any apparent weaponry. <br />

>The vessel has no running lights visible, no sign of power, and is slowly tumbling through space nose-over-tail.<br />

*Zox softly wootles the tune of 'who could it be now'*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Try hailing them<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I doubt that will work ma'am, they've clearly lost power<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think that's definitely a +1 for Malat's suggestion<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we do a scan of everything else in the system to see if they got zapped? That incident with the village that Zox destroyed has me a bit nervous<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Good idea<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Emergency systems are active, reading gravity normal.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Then I think we'd better get over there<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I recommend we stop its movement and rotation with a tractor and beam over an away team to ascertain the situation.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I agree captain<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What is the status of life support?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh yes, of course. You'd better put together an away team.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok, for now we put a pin in this<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I am disgusted and mortified to be in this body, but for now let's just avoid using the transporters<br />
*Commander Bachar wootles in frustration*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We came here to offer assistance, and we still have a duty notwithstanding what bodies we are in<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We come in peace; your vessel appears to be in distress and we offer the Federations best engineers to hep!<br />
**Romulan Officer:** You seem to be having issues of your own, but your offer is appreciated<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Transporter malfunction. I will fix it when I get back. What seems to be the issue here?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, why do I feel like I'm carrying lizard babies?<br />
*Skig looks angrily at Zox.*<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** I an Subcommander Tekal, I am the commander of this vessel<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Psychosomatic. Likely a placebo effect based on your expectations or wants<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well I did not expect this today, but neither woud I have expected to just see a vessel appear out of no where?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I am commander Bachar of the Starfleet vessel Lister, this is my team<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** <admires her now softer, elegant hands><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Don't mind the rank insignia, minor transporter issue<br />
*Commander Bachar turns to Skig/Viraseti*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, you can fix this, right?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I would need to know what the problem is, but likely yes.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Subcommander, what seems to be the issue?<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** You appear to be in the wrong bodies<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Well, that is our issue at least<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes, that is our problem, but what is the technical problem with your vessel?<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** That is difficult to explain simply<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Are we now in Federation space?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Hmm, odd<br />
**Hailey Murry: [  REASON (8) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 1]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 23]**<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes indeed, you are indeed in Federation Space, far away from the Neutral Zone.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** seems to play with her hair a bit much like she had <never felt it before><br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** We were conducting a survey in Romulan space when we detected some odd gravitational readings. Our computer flagged them as possibly related to a previously documented but as-yet unstudied anomoly known as "Mek'an's Folly"<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** <seems to play with her hair a bit much like she had never felt it before><br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** We proceeded to investigate and take scans of the phenomenon, but the phenomenon began to affect the ship and things deteriorated rapidly<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Have the mysterious readings dissapated at all?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** They come and go. Hi, I'm Dr. V'Lora, research lead here on the Chatara<br />
*Dr. V'Lora shakes "Viraseti"'s hand eagerly*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What prompted you to lose power?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** It was absolutely fascinating, the objects appear without warning in space. They undergo continous compositional and topological flux, and are so far unidentified<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, do you have any Romulan Ale on board? My throat is parched and I'm horrifically alcoholish in thish body.<br />
*Skig looks around for "Murry".*<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** But then one of them hit the singularity core and seemed to get stuck on its spacial curvature<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What is your normal BAC? I think it might be getting under your normal threshold.<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Just incredible, I have been down in engineering taking readings for hours. Subcommander: do you realize we could be the first to thouroughly document an entirely unique form of spatial anomoly?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Like are we talking .5 or so, I want to make sure I take good care of this flammable sack.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, no drinking on duty<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I'd recommend not drinking on the job, Skig, unless you want to embarrass yourself<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Sorry, just trying to maintain physical coherency in this form, I need to make sure the hands do not start shaking uncontrollably.<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** We have some Romulan ale in the mess<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That is fascinating Dr. However, I surmise that if you transport out of this vessel without addressing the distortion of curvature, you too will be scrombled as we are.<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Oh I seriously doubt that, if your transporter confinement beam got tangled up in the spatial distortion from our singularity core, your atoms would be spread across the next light year of space<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** For now, let's assume the transporters are unreliable. Skig, can you have someone on your team run a diagnostic?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If we have a problem with the transporters, we should rule out our own equipment before we worry about spatial anomolies<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Excellent. In any case... did you lose power when the signularity struck the curvature or when the Chatara exited from the singularity into Federation space?<br />
*Skig connects back to the Lister.*<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Oh, it was incredible. One of the objects appeared in engineering around the singularity, all of a sudden the ship was thrown violently through space. Our sensor readings were gibberish, no stellar fix, no nav data, nothing.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** T'Kor, I need you to run a level 1 full diagnostic on the transporters, we had a transporter accident and need to verify if there is an issue with the system or this was caused by proximity to the spatial anamoly.<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** We had no idea where we were, and the more we tried to go to warp the worse it got. I cut all the power feeds and then we came to a stop.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, verify that the Romulan ship is still held by our tractor beam.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That's a miracle you ended up anywhere recognizable. <br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Forgive the young Dr for her enthusiasm, she does not know when to shut up.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So the powerless state on your ship is self-inflicted and you can restore power easily once you determine the impact the anamoly is having on your system?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** looks at Tekal with one of those, "Oh, you have one of those in your crew also" looks?<br />
*Skig looks at Tekal with one of those, "Oh, you have one of those in your crew also" looks?*<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Hopefully, as long as Dr V'Lora did no permanent damage in her zeal to cut power<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** We can't restore power until we un-stick this thing from our singularity drive<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Unless we want to be flung out of the known galaxy!<br />
*Dr. V'Lora giggles*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** May we....see this anomaly?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'd like to take a look at this thing as well<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Subcommander, I would be happy to check your engineering relays and power systems to verify they can be restored at will when it is determined to be safe.<br />
>Dr. V'Lora giddily leads the away team to the engine room. It is a short walk, as the ship is quite small boasting only a handful of labs and research areas, and a crew quarters area.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** <appears disoriented, unable to smell or hear anything><br />
>In engineering, Dr. V'Lora opens the hatch to the singularity drive core, instead of the hot white glow of antimatter falling into the singularity, you see a large pulsating mass of brownish-gray matter. It's shape and size are fluctuating from one moment to the next, occasionally a second or third small object will appear near the first, rapidly fluctuate in shape and size, and either merge into the main one or dissapear<br />

**Dr. V'Lora:** Beatutiful, ins't it<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** So far, we have had no luck in identifying it<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** It's physical properties are in a constant state of flux.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Vulcans said EFF emotions as it lead to very naughty things.</font><br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Could this be....alive?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** It is possible, it is cleraly well outside any understood and documented phenomenon<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Hrm. Have you established if it is consuming antimatter?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** thus depeleting the singularity?<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** We are unable to assess what is happening inside it<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** I doubt it would interract with the antimatter at all, in order for antimatter to anihilate with ordinary matter it needs to interact with its own anti-particle<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** But this object is made of completely different... stuff<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Subcommander, do I have your permission to perform an engineering check of your power systems and relays to ensure they are capable of being powered back on safely once the issue with the singularity core is resolved?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** It doesn't correspond to any of the known degrees of freedom of ordinary matter fields<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Please do, this is a research vessel so our own engineering capability is limited<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Commander, can I shave this beard?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I cannot concentrate<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The beard will SHED if you keep tugging at it.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti makes a disgusted face*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Then you will end up with small bristly fibers in all sorts of inconvenient sensitive electronics.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I mean, you can shave it off. It grows at a rate of 3mm/day.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I need to go brief the captain, let him know our situation. Skig, see what you can do here. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes ma'am<br />
*Commander Bachar heads off to an unoccupied conference room to hail the captain*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Hrm. What if the captain doesn't believe Zox?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, Viraseti and Murry, whichever of you is which body, work with Dr V'lora to determine what we can about the Singularity. If needed patch into the Lister's Modular Laboratories, configured for Quantum Gravitational Theory, and provide analysis back to the teams on the Lister.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Aye Ma'am<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Sounds good!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I will work on the verifying and maintaining the engineering systems.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'll get a data link set up<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Zox, don't do anything that results in greivous injury to the body you are currently inhabiting.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I couldn't if I tried, it's all soft and strange...<br />
>Suddenly, a new object appears near the entrance to engineering. It is similar in appearance to the one on the singularity core, but it quickly grows in size before splitting into two separate objects. The two new objects move apart, changing in shape before both shrink down smaller and pop out of existence again. Numerous other similar looking objects continue to pop into and out of existence for a few minutes, changing shape and size, sometimes merging together and sometimes splitting apart. <br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That has NEVER stopped you before.<br />
*Dr. V'Lora runs over with her hand scanner to take readings of the objects*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That is highly unusual <br />
