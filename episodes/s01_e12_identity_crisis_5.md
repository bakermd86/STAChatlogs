>INTERIOR Briefing Room: Immediately after the Captain's all hands call, the Twins summon the few remaining senior officers and acting senior officers to the briefing room to discuss the situation. As everyone filters in, the Twins are standing motionless and wordless in the corner.<br />

*Kolea knows how the greatest empire in Galactic History lost to this... PLOT ARMOR!*<br />
**Throk:** Hello, Councilor Throk has arrived<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That has an ominous ring to it<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Anyone know why the Twins summoned us?<br />

>As the officers mill about waiting for the Twins to start the briefing, they suddenly leave the corner and start walking around the table, extracting small sample vials of blood from each officer and then swallowing them<br />

**Kolea:** This is disturbing.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Apologies for our delay, we were in Stellar Cartography when the Captain made his all hands call.<br />
*Throk reaches forward to test the attachedness of the Twins heads, confirming that they are holograms*<br />

>Throk grabs the medical sample robot and begins trying to pull it apart, but it seems to be pretty well made<br />

*Throk licks each of the twins to make sure they don't taste like changelings*<br />
**Throk:** Throk thinks you taste... how does Zox say... artisinal<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We had assumed the captain was suffering from paranoia, however perhaps he has a point that this crew belong in the brig<br />
**Kolea:** Throk, please stop licking the Bynars, your saliva might corrode their cybernetics.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 move away from Throk and take different seats*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Now, notwithstanding questions around Gorn cuisine... We called you here because we made a concerning discovery<br />
**Kolea:** *inserts shocked pikachu face*<br />
*Krepeka makes goofy breathing noises.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** While the Captain was in surgery, we attempted to re-establish communication with the away team. However, we were not able to raise them. Upon investigation, we discovered that the vessel is no longer visible on our scanners<br />
**Kolea:** We have been at Warp for over a day and a half and the Romulan ship was without power...<br />
**Kolea:** Also, aren't the sensors offline for a Level 5 diagnostic?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We terminated the Captain's busywork orders when he went into surgery and brought ship's systems back online<br />
*Kolea glances at the Captain.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Which raises another important point: Is the captain still fit to command, in your combined medical opinion?<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 turns to Dr. Zerra and Nurse Kolea*<br />
*Kolea glances in the direction of the Captain in sick bay.*<br />
*Kolea waits patiently for Zerra to speak.*<br />
**Throk:  [2d20 = 10]**<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** He is clearly suffering from confusion and possibly paranoia, but given that he has already declared a mutiny in progress, it may not be a good idea to attempt to relieve him of command<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It may indeed be safer to allow the captain to continue on this course towards Starbase 34 and allow him to turn over command to the flag officer there. Any objections?<br />
**Kolea:** I believe it would be prudent to not appear to be engaged in additional mutineering actions while other people are already doing it.<br />

**Kolea:** I feel the Captain's mental and physical health will further deteriorate if people he percieves are loyal try to remove him from command.<br />
**Krepeka:  [Total: 5] [Effects: 1] [4dChallenge = 5]**<br />
**Throk:** Councilor Throk wonders who is currently at Starbase 34, and if they know we are coming. <br />
**Krepeka:** Hello fellow crew; it may appear trivial, but there have been 8 incidents involving drunk, rogue, or disgruntled captains causing significant casualties, damage, or interstellar embrassement when in the vicinity of a starbase. Perhaps we should keep the captain and the vessel away from trouble...<br />
**Kolea:** Only 8?<br />
**Kolea:** What is the time frame you are using for that data?<br />
**Krepeka:** I believe our Security Chief would call it a recpie for trouble.<br />
**Throk:** What are odds that the Captain takes action against Star Base 34? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Rear Admiral Vinter is in command of the starbase, we cannot confirm whether she knows we are en route however, it seems unwise to discuss this situation with the admiral over comms<br />
**Krepeka:** If he simply gets the idea that changelings are on the starbase....high?<br />
**Kolea:** I would not worry about the Captain taking action against the Starbase, and if he did, then I think it would be prudent to stop his action by reason of medical concern.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If the captain orders an attack on Starbase 34, we trust that the crew will refuse the ordr<br />
*Kolea looks at Dr. Zerra.*<br />
**Kolea:** Right?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** And we would be forced to relieve him of command<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Oh, yes of course<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That would be very prudent<br />

**Krepeka:** Might I suggest tuning proble wave density funciton variable 16 to pi minus 42, as Romulan Cloaking devices have a known bug at that frequency?<br />
**Throk:** Counselor Throk wonders why three<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Reasonable suggestion, we will make the adjustment. It may also be wise to resume the investigation into the transporter malfunction, as Lt. T'kor was not able to finish it before the Captain ordered it stopped<br />
**Kolea:** Can I ask a couple questions? As the remaining senior staff is here and the question of the away team has come up.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes of course<br />
**Kolea:** There was mention of a deleted transporter log that I believe Gra'lan was arrested for. Which happened around the time of the malfunction. Do we have any information on that?<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 pause for a moment and look into the distance*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Stand by, accessing<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You are correct, there is a missing transport log entry around Stardate 61794<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have searched the work log, it seems Mr. Gra'lan was working on restoring the deleted record from physical backups<br />
**Krepeka:** I find it unlikely that Gra'lan has commited an act of sabotage; it is not likely to attain that many grey hairs with nefarious or malicious actions.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were not aware such physical backups existed, however leave it to Commander Skig to "go the extra mile"<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Regardless, it could be important to recover that record. We grant permission to continue that work, although we believe that locating our missing away must take priority so we will continue with the probe preparations to do that.<br />
**Kolea:** I see, would you be able to check the logs to determine who changed the Captain's daily hypospray injector from 100ml of Bendraya Novosipirator to 150ml of Bendrazodohroid?<br />
*Kolea watches reactions from people around the table.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The captain's medication was changed? Naturally, stand by while we check the replicator logs<br />

**Kolea:** Is it hot in here doctor?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I don't think the captain's medication is the most important thing to be worried about here nurse<br />
**Kolea:** I disagree.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** He just had heart replacement surgery, and we have the missing away team to deal with<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, which I noticed you were... busy?<br />
**Throk:** Counselor Throk advises the doctor set his medkit on the table<br />
**Kolea:** And the dosage modification would drastically shorten his lifespan while making him irritable and paranoid?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ah whatever, I thought this plan sucked anyways<br />
**Throk:** It is not good to fiddle<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think we lost them for now<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But we probably need a plan, it sounds like from Lt. Krepeka's last all hands call that Dr. Zerra is also gassing people now<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Things seem to be spiralling out of control a little bit<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Any ideas?<br />
**Ishemok:** People would pay for officer training scenarios like this.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Besides stealing a shuttle and running away to Risa<br />
**Gra'lan:** The best thing about the Tandy 1000-SX is that you can hold down the F8 key while it is booting to downcycle the processor to 4.77Mhz so Pong works.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Fascinating information, but I'm not sure how that helps here<br />
**T'kor:** We're currently moving at warp speed, the shuttle would be a terrible option to use right now<br />
**Gra'lan:** The simple solution is to follow the Jeffries tubes to main engineering and shut down the transporters and lift tubes to avoid recapture and hope we can hold out long enough for the rest of the command staff to return.<br />
**Gra'lan:** I'm pretty sure T'Kor can melt some doors shut.<br />
