>EXTERIOR - Flooded Canyon: Kurij and Skig are being swept downriver and are about to crest the waterfall. Malat is unconcious on the ground, while Ishemok is dissoriented, but alert after his head injury.<br />

**Kurij:** How heavy --blub-- are you?!<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Sorry, my internet has chosen NOW to be mostly unusuable. I've been having this problem for about a week now.</font><br />

**Ishemok:** I never stole it! it found it's way into my pockets by chance<br />
*Ishemok coughts and moans on the edge of consciousness.*<br />

**Ishemok:** ....but I don't want to be a businessman, I want to be an intergalatic chairity worker and red-cross, i.e. the federation...<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There is no reason to worry Kurij, this entire situation is mitigated by the fact that Tellerites are not naturally bouyant. All I have to do is trigger the flooding system on my EVA suit to cause us both to sink to the bottom and then we can walk over to the edge by holding our breath.<br />
*Skig triggers the intakes on her EVA suit to turn it into an underwater hydropump to basically pass water through her while she walks over to the shore in the same manner as inline submarine shunt system.*<br />
**Kurij:** That sounds like a more managable problem<br />

>Fortunately, Skig's plan worked a lot better than Ishemok's and the water-logged Tellarite emerges from the torrent with Kurij clinging to her back. They cling on the rocks at the base of the cliff, unable to pull themselves up with the additional weight of 100kg of water in Skig's EVA suit<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Are you ok down there?<br />

**Kurij:** Commander, I believe that violates the 68W-C1192 medical code. Cardassians are more vulnerable to thermal shock and that water is quite chilly. Other methods should be tried instead. <br />
*Cmdr Bachar narrows her eyes*<br />
**Kurij:** But of course we can do it on your command<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Good point Lieutenant, suggestions<br />
**Ishemok:** Drugs.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Leave her sedated as we do not know if she will be hostile or not and we need one less variable in our current equations.<br />

**Kurij:** Ishemok, you are a literal twig, what are you doing?<br />
>Ishemok attempts to hoist Malat up over his shoulder but stumbles and drops her instead, she rolls down the hill toward the water<br />

**Kurij:** Speaking of which, Bachar, can you describe your rescue of Ishemok for a moment?<br />
**Ishemok:** Seems it was a flight of the imagination, eh?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I grabbed an exposed root in the cliff face and was able to reach down and grab him by his collar<br />

*Skig facepalms now, whether people can see it or not.*<br />
>When Matat hits the water, she jolts awake<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** HOOOO THAT IS COLD!<br />
**Kurij:** Lieutenant Malat, over here!<br />
>As Malat screams, the away team find themselves suddenly back in the cargo bay. Bachar and Ishemok are standing on an unbroken section of the catwalk, while Kurij is laying prone on a section which collapsed and has formed a steep ramp down to the cargo floor below. Malat is down below on an automated cargo conveyor which is slowly carrying her across the cargo deck<br />

**Ishemok:** Oh whew....<br />
**Kurij:** Oh<br />
**Kurij:** Hey, did it end for all of you as well?<br />
**Kurij:** That's weird<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What the hell just happened<br />
*Ishemok immediately eyes for valuable objects.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The sensory delusions we are experiencing are getting drastically worse. Commander, was similar behavior being observed on the Lister?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Not that I know of<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But we need to get to the bottom of this<br />
**Ishemok:** quick, time to drink some water before we all fail our Ketracel-white tests!<br />
**Kurij:** Does anybody have a working com badge?<br />
*Cmdr Bachar taps her commbadge and hears only a dull thud*<br />

>Ishemok also hears a quiet thud when trying his commbadge<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, as it stands, we should return to the Lister and use the scanner suite to perform a wideband scan of the entire neurological spectrum to see if there is previously unidentified radiation triggering these hallucinogenic episodes.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Plus, I'm worried about leaving Hailey "I blow out entire sections of the ship" and Zox "Let's try making omeletes with the nacelles" alone on the Lister too long.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I would tend to agree, if comms are down, can you find a way to get us over?<br />
**Ishemok:** Wouldn't it be strange that four species would all react the same way?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Commonality in our neurological makeup possibly.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or possibly not neurological, could be holographic<br />
**Kurij:** Like the snake things, but expanding wider? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Whatever it is, we're going to need access to a science lab on the Lister to figure it out. Unless this salvage freighter has a shockingly competent scientific suite<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah, good point Malat, there could be some sort of malfunctioning holodeck technology from the salvaged Federation vessel, I was thinking of neurological by virtue of the cerebral degeneration observed in the Taganites.<br />
**Kurij:** Skig, have you gotten communications up on this ship? <br />

*Skig fixed a few things by cannibalizing other things, in true Skig fashion. Also, since she is anti-social, it completely makes sense that she would rip out major portions of the Comm Equipment to pull it off.*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So, I doubt that it would be possible to bring Comms back up without taking main power off line. I was thinking it would be more efficient to re-power the transporter room adjacent to the engineering controls and just beam back to the Lister.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Since I'm highly suspicious that things on the Lister might be going off-track and we don't have comms, I'm going to modulate the transporter so we phase through the shield frequency I set today, just in case the Lister has its shields up because paranoia is gripping the crew.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Good thinking, if you can bring the transporter back online we can beam directly to the science lab on deck 6<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, I shall begin work on that at once.<br />
**Ishemok:** What if our perception of time was altered by that holodeck or whatever? won't we be throwing ourselves into atomic oblivion? can we check the time first?<br />

*Skig transports Ishemok to a Star Citizen 890J so he can die in a space game on a ship that has a pool, casino, and brothel.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Science Lab: Lt. Cmdr Viraseti is busy welding the door to her lab shut with a phaser when the away team materializes near her desk<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Nope, nothing weird happening here!</font><br />
>A few moments later, Skig materializes completely naked. It seems she inadvertently engaged the biofilter to "stringent" when she beamed over and removed everything that didn't contain her DNA. She'll need to eat a lot of yogurt later to replenish her decimated microbiome<br />

*Skig shrugs.*<br />
**Ishemok:** feeeeemales?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good to know that works.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti spins around at the sound of Ishemok and Skig speaking*<br />

*Skig executes her entire fan base.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Don't tell me you're all losing your minds too<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** What happened to your uniform commander?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** On the contrary, I believe Ishemok's mind was always lost.<br />
**Ishemok:** Well, we have to figure this one out ASAP before we have two derelict ships eh?<br />
**Kurij:** By the way, Ishemok, that's a violation of USSC Code 1742-B. It's not going to be good for you. The DNA recognition doesn't always work well with medical gels that are that close to the body. <br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I seem to have set the biolfilter too strictly when I transported myself over.<br />
**Ishemok:** Surely there will be many more, and more pertinent crimes to punish with the whole crew gone mad. Im not too worried.<br />
*Skig walks over to nearest replicator and generates herself a new uniform.*<br />
**Kurij:** Have there been incidents here as well, Lt Commander? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** While I'm getting new clothes, Viraset, can you bring Commander Bachar and the rest of the away team up to speed on what is going on here.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Oh, you could say that<br />
>A loud banging is heard on the door<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Is it a Zox style banging?</font><br />
**Security Officer:** Open this door right now Viraseti, or we're going to cut through it<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** EAT SHIT MUTINEER!<br />
**Kurij:** Uh<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns and points her phaser at the away team*<br />

>As the away team contemplates their situation, the ship's PA comes to life with a loud whistle.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Attention all hands, this is the Captain speaking. Commander Zox and Counselor Murry are attempting to carry out a mutiny in violation of Starfleet regulations and Federation law. They are armed and extremely dangerous, all crew are hereby ordered to subdue them on-sight by whatever means necessary<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Don't listen to him, the Captain has been replaced with a changling<br />
**Kurij:** Oh<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** How do you know?<br />
**Kurij:** And what are you working on?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I saw him turn into a Briromian Tiger and maul one of my junior science officers<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah, so the mass hallucinogenics are happening here also.<br />
**Kurij:** Quite so<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Viraseti, carry on sealing the door<br />
**Ishemok:** Hrm...This is all so confusing.<br />
**Kurij:** Do you think this is caused by proximity? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I have no idea what is going on here, but I don't mind having a welded shut door between us<br />
**Ishemok:** Wait...what do doors mean in an age of transporters?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Quite possibly. It's either proximity to some sort of radiation between transmitted from the other ship, or some sort of biological contaminant. However, the biological contaminant seems unlikely because that is kind of a trope we have beaten lately.<br />
**Ishemok:** Skig, get us out of here, we need to reason with Zox, the beast can be tamed with the right plants<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We need to figure out what the hell is going on<br />
**Kurij:** Zox is difficult to reason with, and if he's mutineering then I'd rather keep distance between him and us<br />
**Kurij:** He's scary<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm more worried about Murray blowing up MORE decks of my recently repaired ship.<br />
**Ishemok:** Hrm<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We need some idea what is causing these hallucinations, or whatever they are, and some protection against it<br />
**Kurij:** Do you think our Holodeck is a safe zone?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Correct, Viraseti, what do you think about running a wide band scan of the Taganite ship, overlapping neurological stimulants and radiations that would impact brain waves of all Starfleet crew member races to see if there is a shield modulation option we can use to filter it out?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think now is the best time to be playing around in the holodeck<br />
**Ishemok:** That sounds good, how do we do that?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Hmm, you think the mutineers may be affected by something from the taganite ship? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It's worth a look<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Anything we can use to stop these bastards...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I doubt the crew would randomly pick now to stage a mutiny.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti angrily runs over to her terminal and begins tapping away on her controls*<br />
*Skig gives Commander Bachar the, "may not be 100% sane" gesture and points a thumb at Viraseti while the Science Officer's back is turned.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It's not the crew, it's this changeling that replaced the captain. I caught on to him when he tried to kill you by evacuating all of the oxygen from the briefing room earlier today<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But before I realized he was a changeling, he got security on his side and they tried to arrest me for carrying a phaser rifle into the bridge<br />
**Ishemok:** How did you know it was a changeling?<br />
**Kurij:** He transformed into a tiger<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And not just from the Taganite frieghter, its permeating this entire region of subspace<br />
**Ishemok:** Oh goody, can we charge people for the cure? <br />
**Kurij:** We don't sell cures to our own crew<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Also we live in a moneyless society<br />
**Ishemok:** What about sell the region of space as a mental amusement park?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Possibly, but first off, let's modulate that out with our shields.<br />

>INTERIOR - Science Lab: In the immediate aftermath of Skig’s successful remodulation of the shields to completely block out all of the subspace neural energy that has been flooding the ship, the crew began to hear a painful ringing of ever greater volume. Within only a few moments, the ringing had reached a level that was physically harmful.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Commander, your plan seems not to have had the desired effect<br />

**Ishemok:** Turn it off! Turn it off!<br />
**Kurij:** We need to recalibrate!<br />
**Kurij:** Skig! Why is this happening?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would guess that whatever the localized phenomena in this area is has created a resonance field that impacts our auditory membranes.<br />
*Ishemok rolls on the floor clutching his bleeding, giant ears.*<br />

*Ishemok restrains himself from and gently dabs some blood from his ears.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It appears that there is a subspace rift that is looped around and through this section of space. It is localized within the Lister, which caused the resonance field to cause a harmonized subcochlear reaction.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I adapted to the problem by positing this would be a good way to incapacitated the non-Zox, yet violent members of the crew while further analyzing the situation.<br />
**Kurij:** Why on earth is it localized within the Lister?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suspect Murry's former crewmember may have answers in that regard, even if the crewmember herself does not know it.<br />
*Skig blinks and looks at the crew as if they should be in awe of her Vulcan like application of a solution to the problem.*<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And I've never seen a cosmic string get looped and coiled up like this<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, I was having a hard time rationalizing such a thing, hence my hesitation when looking at this.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti is so distracted by a new scientific phenomenon she has forgotten about her desire to fight to the death with the "mutineers"*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, it reminded me that I need to clean up the wiring in subdeck communication cabinet 4 after certain red shirts used it as an orgiastic party once they were loaded up on the illegal narcotics Ishemok sold them that I was supposed to not report to Zox.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good work Ensign Ishemok, I should put in a transfer request to have you moved to the science department<br />
**Kurij:** So if it's stuck in a loop, is it possible to drag it away from the ship? String it out and away or just break the resonnance? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can, I, uh, borrow this phaser rifle if you are not going to need it?<br />
**Ishemok:** Shhh! Rule 420: Business in the open won't be business for long.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Hmm. Now that is an interesting idea to string it out. Perhaps it is like an electrical transformer, the coiling itself could be causing it to function as a transmitter<br />
**Kurij:** A transmitter for what? What's it picking up? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Whatever the ends are anchored to<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or what is it transmitting?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Although what that is... Is out of my area of expertise<br />

**Ishemok:** Can we sell this as a cosmic bungee jumping ride?<br />
