>INTERIOR - Lounge: Gul Haloras shoves Malat away as he grabs his bottle of Kanar from the table. Malat begins to bellow steam from her ears as she grabs Gul Haloras by his collar...<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** You're going to go back to your quarters now... sir. On your feet, or in a box<br />
*Kolea hurries over to the quarelling pair.*<br />
*Kolea puts her hand gently on Gul Haloras' shoulder.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** As a medical professional, perhaps you could describe to me in great detail your excellent record in crushing Bajoran skulls, I believe that is what you said. I mean, hers is hardly worth bloodying yourself over. Think of all the paperwork it would cause as a diplomatic incident.<br />

*Kolea does not notice Zox either Planting Evidence On OR removing items from Gul Haloras.*<br />
*Admiral Janeway walks into the lounge just in time to see Kolea and Zox carrying Haloras away unconscious*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I'll help you get him to Sick Bay. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Yes ma'am, situation normal for the Lister.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vrell.png" alt="Proconsul Vrell" width="50" height="50">**Proconsul Vrell** If this is a normal day for you, I should come visit again sometime<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Sometimes the really arrogant ones have the sticks in their ass catch on fire as well.<br />
*Zox Wonders if there's a conference where both Gul Haloras and Malat are picked from the audience to learn conflict resolution.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It's a constant struggle<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): We've broken their code!</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Rhuk.png" alt="Rhuk" width="50" height="50">**Rhuk** Well.....I have to go put the original back.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** But this has been an amazing engineering session of a 1:1 recreation of a positronic matrix embedded in an isolinear rod<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I can only assume you fell very far from the genetic tree your mother is part of, perhaps you were a pruned offshoot.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** However, rarely have I seen such perfection, it's like you designed a next generation Isolinear Rod with 10x the capacity at a fraction of the production cost.<br />
*Captain Bachar walks in on Skig and Zox making the copy of Gul Haloras' isolinear rod*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I can only assume we differ in methods. Words and food are just more....civilized.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Captain.<br />
*Zox stands at attention.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I am going to abstain from asking about this so I don't have to mention it in my eventual court martial <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** It is best.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Gra'lan serves as a distraction here. Not enough time to court martial em all.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I talked to Janeway, she doesn't want you breaking her ship again. So the away team is going to have to use Ol' Faithless<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** In fact, I will suggest that Obliviousness is Bliss ma'am.<br />
*Skig shudders.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** WHAT?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I can definitely understand Admiral Janeway's concern, but we should take a more circumspect ship that is not so obviously Tellerite Engineering Personified and Perfected.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I best be moving. <br />
*Zox lets out the wootle of subterfuge.*<br />
*Skig adds in a "Property of Obsidian Order" tag.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Well in that case, I suppose you can take the civilian transport or a standard shuttle. Any thoughts on the away team?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I think the best time for the away team to depart is immediately after the meet-and-greet, everyone will have shown their face enough to alay suspicion and things will be a bit busy, good time to slip away unnoticed<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Darisha would always be useful.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Mowus is still carping at losing the ability to study the Pelarians.</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I have to head to Gul Haloras' event, I hope he sobers up a bit first<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I believe we are ready to go, I am very grateful for this opportunity to demonstrate my leadership skills.<br />
*Skig flips over card to see if there is anything else she needs to read off it.*<br />

*Kolea "exercises" Gul Haloras to sober him up.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Conference Room III - Gul Haloras stands in the center of the room, around him are many small tables each with a single chair. As the attendees file in, they sit down at the tables around the room. On each table is a small grey and blue board covered with small polymer pieces.<br />

*Kolea is showering and unable to attend, it takes a while for her hair to dry.*<br />
*Mowus wants to attend a class on conflict due to being an anthropologist.*<br />
**Gul Haloras** If you would all your take your seats, what we will be doing today is learning how to think strategically. And learning more about how all of our difference species visualize strategic challenges<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** Oooooh Im bubbling with excitement.<br />
**Gul Haloras** In front of you is a Kotra board, I trust you are all familiar with the game. Kotra is a game of strategy, such games are useful to hone your strategic thinking skills. <br />
**Gul Haloras** Whether something as simple as Kotra, or large-scale wargames coordinated between our respective governments.<br />
**Gul Haloras** Naturally, my own strategic skill are far too great to expect any of you to overcome them alone, which is why I will be playing all of you at once. Together, we can learn from one another and hone our understanding of our mutual strategic thinking.<br />
*Zox somewhere off in the distance, remembers this strategic genius losing to a garbage field and a salvage merchant.*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Sun Tzu get.</font><br />
**Gul Haloras** Hmm, most enjoyable<br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Mowus was game #3, lost to time</font><br />
**Gul Haloras** Mowus, you  show deft strategic thinking but you are too thoughtful. If you could learn to be more decisive, act with greater speed, you would be a truly worth opponent<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Why thank you! I learned much and had fun!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** Why thank you! I learned much and had fun!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** I always try to use the Finnish opening. =D<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Your game is most interesting, but the captured pieces are far too chewy and taste of wood.<br />
**Gul Haloras** And you, Hailey Murry. You are agressive, but you act without thinking. Before you charge at your enemy you must first consider whether you are exposing yourself to counterattack.<br />
**Gul Haloras** And you Throk... I am thankful that you refrained from any attempts at violence over the outcome of the game<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** It okay, Throk waiting for you to eat loser's pieces to assert dominance in proper fashion.<br />
**Gul Haloras** These excercise may seem trivial, but through this struggle we can learn about our respective strategic thinking.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It's been probably 30 years since I played that. I took on the strategy to try and time you out, put some pressure onto you. <br />

**Gul Haloras** A worthy strategy for a simultaneous game such as this, I commend your outside the box thinking<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** I believe I will be acquring some Kotra boards.<br />
**Gul Haloras** I hope that everyone has learned something valuable. I find that games like Kotra give a unique insight into the way we think strategically and tactically <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** Much more engaging than watching Throk hunt crew members or Kolea take them to sick bay for no apparent reason.<br />
**Gul Haloras** Throk sounds like an interesting fellow, I am glad to have met him<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** He's a lot more than meets the eye, and he is quite a lot that meets the eye<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** decides he has changed his mind about Gul Haloras, and despite coming to blows with Malat, is respectable.<br />
