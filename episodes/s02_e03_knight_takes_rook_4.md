>INTERIOR - Voth Greenhouse: The rows upon rows of cabbages, caulifowers, carrots, and other assorted vegetables are sitting comfortably in the sun, absorbing its radiation, swaying gently under the ventilation of the sophisticated greenhouse. Their quiet day of being plants is suddenly and very rudely interupted when a young Andorian pilot crash lands a flaming shuttlecraft through the roof, plowing into dozens of innocent cabbages.<br />

>The crew stumble out of the Delta Flyer as the greenhouse's fire suppression system activates, dousing them all in water.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** We have 1 injured from among our crew. Also hello, it has been a while.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** Oh, I'm injured<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v6.png" alt="Brag" width="50" height="50">**Brag** Zox? This is certainly unexpected<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v7.png" alt="Kagon" width="50" height="50">**Kagon** I'm surprised that Starfleet hasn't locked you up yet<br />
*Brag smacks Kagaon in the head*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Aw, they can't lock up their most famous chef!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v6.png" alt="Brag" width="50" height="50">**Brag** We should take your friend to the clinic.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yes please, thanks for the offer. Helpful as ever.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v7.png" alt="Kagon" width="50" height="50">**Kagon** What happened to you? Forgot how to fly an orbital approach?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** I'd appreciate it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Someone opened fire on us. We can probably look up the coordinates. Didn't expect that really...I mean most of us stick together.....most of us.<br />
>Brag and Kagon lead the away team into the colony. It is a moderately sized collection of residential buildings and public spaces, surrounded by farmland and greenhouses as far as the eye can see. The population appears to number in the low thousands in this town.<br />

*Zox glares at Kagon*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v6.png" alt="Brag" width="50" height="50">**Brag** I can't believe that someone in the colony would have opened fire on your ship. Well, Kagon may have if he knew you were on it, but probably no one else.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk looking for things to kill that shot at our ship. Or food. Or both.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v7.png" alt="Kagon" width="50" height="50">**Kagon** I resent that, I would have rammed it.<br />
*Throk looks for things that he should consider eating.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Ghex, please triangulate the position of whatever took us out of the sky.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, it happened, Someone doesn't want us here, strange as it may be.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh yes sir, I'll get right on it sir! Very important stuff, I can totally do that. No question.<br />
*Throk helpfully bends a piece of metal into the shape of a triangle to help Ghex.*<br />
*Ensign Ghex runs off towards the burning shuttle.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** Happens as often as not. I wouldn't be surprised if this was all a big misunderstanding<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk conflicted, does Throk follow small blue creature that likely will get seriously injured off screen, or stck with Voth Security Chef who is 100% likely ot get seriously injured on-screen?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Where is 'food' more likely to arrive?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** Go help out Ghex, she may need help moving things out of the way<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** It happens, but not on an agri-world. I didn't even know they had anti-ship batteries.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** If Zox is okay with that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Sure am!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk go help small blue creature move heavy objects.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk also excited to be away from people who can try to convince him not to eat perfectly edible Voth.<br />
*Throk runs after Ghex.*<br />
>Brag and Kagon lead the crew to a small medical office near the town's main square, as they enter a small, older Voth notices them and comes out from behind his desk<br />

<img src="../images/auto/v2.png" alt="Dr. Korok" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Korok** Hmm... I hadn't heard you'd returned Zox, how did you injure yourself this time?<br />
*Dr. Korok begins scanning Zox with a medical tricorder*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Someone planetside opened fire on my ship and my crew.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v2.png" alt="Dr. Korok" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Korok** Strange, you don't seem to be injured<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** That'd be me with the injury this time<br />
*Oakadan points at the blood trail*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v2.png" alt="Dr. Korok" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Korok** Ah, of course.<br />

*Throk follows Ensign Ghex into the room, with a largish bloody bone hanging from his mouth as he chews thoughtfully.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I was waiting outside for just the right moment to make an entrance, I didn't want to interrupt your reunion and then I thought that was the perfect, dramatic time to burst in, you know. How was it? Was it too much? Was it not professional enough for a Starfleet officer? Maybe I should have just come in quietly when I got back and not tried.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk think small blue person is adorable and wants to keep her.<br />
*Throk gently pats Ghex on the head like she is a pet.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** But I just thought it would be pretty cool, and you guys get to do so much cool stuff and I usually don't get to do the cool stuff, you know?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Whatcha got?<br />
*Throk rummages through pockets looking for a snack and finds a piece of cabbage and gives it to her.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh right... I triangulated the coordinates of the incoming fire that took us down, it originated from a ground-based phaser array about 2km outside the town<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** And there we go.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Fantastic!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** Do we have a map of the settlement we can refer to?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v6.png" alt="Brag" width="50" height="50">**Brag** Sounds like one of the defense grid emitters <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** We don't need a map, everything is coded with scents. can't you tell?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Interesting....but why would they fire on a federation ship?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Yes, Throk noticed beautiful aroma of Voth eggs.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** They have nice mushrooms and plenty of spring onions.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v6.png" alt="Brag" width="50" height="50">**Brag** True, as for the defense grid, it could be a malfunction<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** Would it be okay if we took a look at it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v6.png" alt="Brag" width="50" height="50">**Brag** The system is automated, and it doesn't really get a lot of use. It was installed during the Dominion war, I don't think it's ever been activated since<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I do believe you are coming with us Mr. Kagon...yes...as we investigate the defense grid. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk think Starfleet would not declare war on Voth colony, after all, Voth eggs cook much like Ostrich eggs and require special treatment, unlikely to be worth fighting a war over.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/v2.png" alt="Dr. Korok" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Korok** Try not to get yourself impaled, burned, gored, or otherwise grievously injured<br />

*Zox bows graciously to  Dr. Korok*<br />
>The walk to the defense grid is brisk, the fresh air and open space are a welcome change of pace (apart from Ghex complaining about the heat continously). At the coordinates, the crew finds a small, Class IV planetary defense phaser emitter.<br />

*Throk hands Dr Korok two of the crayons from his box to help track Bingo cards and adds him to the instant messaging group Kolea setup.*<br />
