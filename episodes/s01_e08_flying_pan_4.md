>Captain's Log, supplemental: Skig's survey team missed their rendevouz and are now several hours overdue. We have been unable to reach them on comms, and we can't read the shuttle's warp signature anywhere. Lt. Malat and the Twins are tracking its ion trail to retrace its steps. I hope I don't end up regretting approving Skig's request to use that junker for the survey. If we're lucky, they were just kidnapped by Gorn slavers or something. If the shuttle blew up predictably, I'm going to get called in for another command review...<br />

>INTERIOR - Lister Bridge: Captain Baras sits uneasily on the bridge as his staff conduct the search for his missing officers.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Any sign of the shuttle?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have not detected anything else since the last time you asked. 3 minutes and 41 seconds ago.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Last sign of the shuttle indicates that forest moon. I hope they weren't killed by teddy bears with rocks and sticks. Tends to happen to highly trained personnel.<br />
*Throk exits the turbolift carrying Zox's Ceremonial Voth Warblade polished to a sheen.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect this crew not at risk of death from trademark infringing teddy bears, no one here other than Bachar is highly trained.<br />
**Throk:** For instance, Throk require watching instructional video on pant zippers most morning.<br />
*Throk hands Zox his Ceremontial Voth Warblade.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Why thank you Throk! I am no longer fearful for the crew saftey, and I never though't i'd get that tarnish off.<br />
**Throk:** This work very well for disco ball on lower decks rave party also.<br />
*Throk pauses.*<br />
**Throk:** Wait, I was supposed to use inside voice for that.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Which moon is that, Zox? I'm seeing two with large amounts of trees, one frozen and one thawed. <br />

**Throk:** That was the other button, not the one you pushed.<br />
**Throk:** But as you are elite Security Chief, I assume you meant to do that.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Lieutenant Malat, take us in closer so Zox can try that again at closer range.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Red Alert, shields up<br />
**Throk:** Throk recommend a full spread of photon torpedoes to nuke the site from orbit, it is the only way to be sure.<br />
*Throk pauses.*<br />
*Zox secretly just likes the red lights, easier on the reptile eyes.*<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are reading several dozen small objects in orbit of the planet, they appear to be the source of the probing that Commander Zox is detecting.<br />
**Throk:** Throk has downloaded Command and Conquer: Red Alert, to Zox's datapad, per instructions.<br />
*Throk hands datapad to Zox.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** They are conducting a scan of the Lister, but no sign of aggressive action at this time.<br />
**Throk:** This one have very good reviews, also, not off Warez site.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, Westwood Studios in their glory days.....I mean wait, we stand READY for orders, Commander!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Who on earth would have set up an array of satellites around an uninhabited moon? <br />
**Throk:** Throk remembers he not member of command crew, should not be here to interfere with actions of brilliant and highly motivated and trained command staff.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I am attempting to ascertain the manufacture and communications mode of the satellites. Reccomend evasive pattern delta 4 while analysis proceeds.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What are we evading? They aren't attacking us<br />
**Throk:** Throk think array of satellites in high orbit would place risk on low orbit shuttle. Throk feel that Skig would never endanger precious shuttlecraft by moving it below satellite positioning system. Perhaps scan for crew members in low orbit in EVA suits?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We are missing a shuttle? What else could have done it?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm not seeing anything specific in the records for who would have placed them in there. <br />
**Throk:** Throk can 100% imagine Skig putting Viraseti in EVA suit and pushing out back of shuttle so Science Officer could gather data while shuttle is safe.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is highly likely that Commander Skig and her survey team would not have detected these objects, they are very small and the shuttle's sensors may not have been sensitive enough to isolate their power signatures<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Honestly, Zox, it's not unlikely that Old Faithless just malfunctioned and dropped them onto the planet<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I put it at 50/50<br />
**Throk:** Much like Murry uses crewmembers for sadistic murderous experiments.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Right, but your job is to drink and feel out the situation, my job is to assume hostile actors. <br />
*Throk nudges Zox.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Excuse me, I use the Holodeck for that, not crew members. The fact that you didn't respect my holodeck time is on you, not me.<br />
*Zox feels a sense of reptilian solidarity with Throk.*<br />
**Throk:** Superior officer Bachar lady want to know why you think we need to be doing evasive maneuvers which interfere with zero-g massage parlor?<br />
**Throk:** No wait, not specifically that, but Throk is curious when that was installed.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Let's not hear anything more about Throk intruding on Murry's holodeck time. I don't want any hostile workplace complaints in my command record<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Zox, do these things pose any threat to the Lister?<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Captain, the hourglass icon is turning at 3 radians per second, computaton should be concluded momentarily...<br />
**Throk:** Throk apologize profusely to nice Captain, workplace is absolutely not hostile compared to Gorn ship where underperforming crew are consumed while still alive.<br />
**Throk:** Also, morale is maintained without floggings, very good bonus.<br />
*Throk leaves to get cookies and milk for command staff, as he feels he needs to apologize for derailing the entire episode.*<br />
*Hailey Murry messages a couple of redshirts to have them aid Throk and make sure he uses the machine correctly this time*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have pinpointed Old Faithless; these records show hostile action was taken by this satellite network. <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh thank goodness<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I was worried that Skig's death trap just exploded and would reflect negatively on my command<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can't be held accountable for something that wasn't listed. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Communications flow towards an unlisted system in Cardassian space. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Couldn't have hit Old Faithless that hard, otherwise I imagine she'd have disintegrated in the descent <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I wonder if they just accidentally flew into one of them? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey, these are not peaceful satellites, they are not filing the Encylopedia Galactica with survey data. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What kind of data are they sending?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We have not much time. Recomend looping by the moon and extracting our crew before the satellites' owners arrive.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The objects are only 1.5 meters across, and there are approximately 64 of them. The odds of the shuttle hitting one by chance are less than 1 in 10 to the 11<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I agree with Zox<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we reach them on comms? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not at this range, we're outside comm badge range<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Then let's move in closer, Zox keep an on those satellites<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Murry to Away Team, do you read? Is anyone there? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hello Murry, we are here but have experienced a few challenges.<br />
**T'Kor:** Excuse me, Skig, I hate to interrupt, but there's an unshielded singularity here and I'd like to request a beam out at your earliest convenience<br />
**Geret:** The machines! They are hungry for energy!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** For instance, I believe T'Kor is in need of emergency transport due to discovering a highly radioactive energy field killing the natives.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Additionally, Old Faithless lost an engine on impact with the planet, and I request you keep the Lister out of range from the energy dampening field being emitted by the defense mechanism of this complex we are in.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are not reading power drain<br />
*Skig stops to think for a second.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And I think I have brought you up to speed on everything going on here.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we beam them up from this distance? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, as long as the Lister is not in danger. However, T'Kor still needs transport as I do not think it would be safe for us to try and retrieve him.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh yes, someone beam up Mt. T'kor<br />
**Geret:** But beams are energy, and *they* are still hungry! Better divert them with another tasty energy source before the singnal is eaten!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** And then move us back to a higher orbit, if Skig is worried about the power drain best to play it safe. <br />
**T'Kor:** Thank you, Chief Engineer. I was starting to get concerned that my lack of decorum was the issue<br />
*Skig gets out dictionary and looks up WTH "decorum" means.*<br />
*Geret skig definition: using fancy twisty ties on cables.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ensign Geret, is that you? Please, calm yourself. As we've discussed in the past, please take a moment. <br />

**Geret:** Yes Ma'm. We have encountered a preponderance of energy draining weaponry, first when the shuttle was downed, and second from offensive drones encountered on planet. Only via offering decoys, or reflecting these beams have we had any success in countering this bizzare reverse energy endothermic weaponry.<br />
**Geret:** ...I mean they need more energy!<br />
**Geret:** hungry hungry drones! Nom nom, eat up those little energy pellets!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** That is actually a reasonable suggestion from the hysterical ensign, Zox come up with a distraction<br />

**Satag:** You address Primark Satag of the Xepai Collective, and your assertion of innocence is irrelevant<br />
**Throk:** Throk impressed we find non-glowy version of T'Kor's people. Maybe T'Kor needs to discuss proper skin care techniques with them? Ishemok, can you arrange for sample sizes for free for them to test with suitable markup for later purchases?<br />
**Throk:** Throk thinks Satag guy translator must be broken, to use word "innocent" when describing Ship's Counselor.<br />
**Throk:** For the record, it is 2381, not sure humans can remember agreements from 2344.<br />
**Throk:** They have short lifespan.<br />
**Satag:** The Federation agreed to honor all Cardassian border agreements with third parties within a 100 light-year radius of the demilitarized zone. The Cardassian Union ceded authority over Xepai space to the Xepai Collective<br />
**Throk:** Also, Satag, I am curious, do you enter larval state and break from carapace when you need to grow, or does your chitin naturally expand?<br />
**Geret:** and is your national sport, cricket?<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We didn't start this? Skig, am I correct, based on the sensor logs, that your personal ship, pride of the Lister, Ye Olde Faithless, was targeted?<br />
**T'Kor:** It seems reasonable to me, though we do have the hiccup of needing to get our Away Team back on board. We'll also need a copy of their side of the treaty, as well as a strongly worded letter to higher command to forward over to the Cardassians. <br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Security Chief Zox, while I must generally agree that anything targeting Old Faithless is a hostile act, the fact is we may have been unintentionally trespassing and activated an automated system.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Federation would have similar systems in place, and the response was to disable, not destroy.<br />
*Captain Baras unmutes the comm line*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Did you feel your person(s) were threatened by a sudden loss of power and dramatic crash onto moon?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** As a result, I would suggest we merely try to defuse the situation by retrieving my command and I and the shuttle craft and departing to open communications with this new spacefaring entity on equal and less intrusive footing.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Or is that how engineers have fun, ya know, like normal people sky-dive or mountain climb to feel alive?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We apologize for any intrusion, our away team seems to have stumbled upon an automated security system and activated it unintentionally. Our records do not indicate this system as being part of your borders, we would be happy to update Starfleet records to properly reflect Xepai space and be on our way after we recover our away team from the moon<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I never feel threatened in Old Faithless, for I know it will survive when other Shuttle craft have been detonated into small pieces while falling into the accretion disk of a double wormhole singularity.<br />
**Geret:** but but....we can't leave those people down there, dying slowly of radation? Can we?<br />
**Satag:** We accept your apology. But your away team has interfered unacceptably in our colonization plan. Our sensor logs indicate they have communicated with the inhabitants <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Only if we play the DS:9 music to close. TNG wouldn't let that shit fly.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We should discuss this with the Xepai and work collectively to correct the problem...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, well, yes, there is that small problem.<br />
**Satag:** We require that you identify all persons contacted by your away team so that they can be terminated in order to prevent further spread of the contamination<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti accesses the ship's sensors and pulls up an audio/visual scan of the village*<br />
**Pinek:** Praise be to Nanon! Our prayers finally answered! Praise be to Speaker Zerra, who on the order of Shaper Nanon, has cured the blight!<br />
*Pinek villagers cheer*<br />
>The villagers cheer<br />

**Ishemok:** It's like a planetary reverse ant-farm. In space, insects toy with humanoids.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Great job Dr.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh dear. Do we have a way of stopping news from spreading? <br />
*Throk points at Satag's ship.*<br />
**Throk:** They have idea, but I don't think you like them.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We can't seriously be entertaining the possibility of letting these Xepai just kill all those people?<br />
*Throk drops off pina colada's, fruit smoothies, and ice cream for command staff, walks back out.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** There were more than 250 people in that village<br />
*Throk puts on the Firefly episode, "Jaynestown" to play in the background.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Intercept and spoof their communications network and destroy them. <br />
*Zox shrugs*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We can't start a war with the Xepai Commander Zox. I don't want to see those people killed, but we need a third option<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What if the Federation needs a new war?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** The last one wasn't enough for you?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** 118 million dead <br />
**T'Kor:** Is it possible that we can beam them aboard and rig their faulty power systems down there to explode, wiping the whole village off the map but saving all the locals? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh, these guys can't be as big as the Cardassian Empire.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** And the Federation is not as expansionary, we don't go around starting wars with neighboring civilizations just because we don't like them.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Beam everyone up, store them in transporter buffers, tell the Xepai we will address the problem we created ourselves, scan the entire village, blow up the current one to "get rid of the locals" and then recreate them in a new spot in a replica of their existing village somewhere not drenched in radiation.<br />
**Ishemok:** Can we buy them off?<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not think we'll be able to reconstruct their temple<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I didn't get the sense that Primark Satag was interested much in money<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The exterior of the temple is all we really care about, T'Kor.<br />
**Ishemok:** Flatter them, tell them how much we love their experiment, how it satisifies our deepest curiosity about civilization.<br />
**Ishemok:** What if they want technology rather than latinum?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Also they seem to be monitoring the planet, that just runs the risk that they come back later and find a larger level of contamination, killing even more of the inhabitants to remove it<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** To do that, we'd have to understand why they're running these experiments<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** He said it was a "colonization plan"<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, I agree. I think it'd be easier if we just lifted all these people off the planet for good. Could we settle them on the other planet? <br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not without blatantly disregarding the Prime Directive<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti huffs*<br />
*Hailey Murry sighs*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Does exterminating a village also blatently disregard the Prime Directive?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You cannot simply abduct less advanced people from their homes and drag them around the galaxy for their own good<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If we did so, we would be no better than colonialist slave traders on acient Earth<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Correct, we are not following the methodology of the Preservers.<br />

**T'Kor:** I'm not sure I get the reference. But we should keep in mind that we must work with what equipment we have on hand, and that equipment is limited. We do not have Old Faithless simply for fun, as fun as she may be. <br />

*Throk walks back in to drop off some snacks.*<br />
**Throk:** Maybe we just make replica village on holodeck, beam them up into holodeck, and carry them around on Lister until Xepai are content. Then we mind-wipe everyone using hypnotic suggestion to think we never existed and beam them back down.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Where does he come up with these ideas?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Not a bad idea in principle, but there is no way we could fit the entire village into the holodeck <br />
*Skig makes a note to check Throk's diet and find out if he is getting too many hallucinogenics.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We could have them cycled through with the buffer, though, couldn't we? <br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Would that take too much time?</font><br />
**Throk:** Throk not sure we have enough prophylactics for Kolea's idea.<br />
**Throk:** Also, censor not allow her to state it on air.<br />
**Ishemok:** Have we surveyed any planets suitable for Dilithium mining in Federation space close by?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** To hold so many people in a transporter buffer for so long would not be safe, either to them or to the Lister's power systems<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In principle, yes, but at the point where we are holding them in transporter buffers would be a danger, as the Twins have said.<br />
**Ishemok:** Xepai need that stuff, and they can only get it from the Cardassians. Perhaps we could arrange for a teensy redrawing of the neutral zone, give them a mineral world and put this one under Federation control.<br />
**Ishemok:** No one wants to trade with the Cardassians. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Uh oh... You all should see this....<br />

**Pinek:** Let the Speakers of Zerra carry forth word of his great deeds to the other villages. May all who follow Nanon know of his generosity and the might of his servants. <br />
**Pinek:** In the name of the Keepers<br />
**Throk:** Is constipation, low-G environment intestines not good for dense food. Anguish is common.<br />
**Ishemok:** Not quite a regal as a Hermes, but you will do as a god, Dr. Zerra.<br />
