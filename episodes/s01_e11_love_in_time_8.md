>INTERIOR - Orlana Research Control Room: As the lights go out, and the internal sensor feed cuts off, the room is cast into darkness for a few moments before the emergency lighting kicks in. The crew can hear Zox over the open comm line, laughing hysterically as the tribbles visciously tickle him.<br />

>Geret takes the contraption from Bachar and is able to operate it much more competently, spraying the hormone solution into the vents<br />

**Geret:** Following orders is fun! Team buulding starts with _you_ in starfleet!<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d20 = 12]**<br />
>As the hormones pour out of the air vents, everyone starts coughing as it seems Viraseti used a formaldehyde group as a stabilizer for the hormone aerosol<br />

*Zox strained wootles intensify*<br />

**Geret:** Yay!<br />

*Skig leaves to restore main power to the systems now that Bachar is not going to stop her, "Because the Tribbles are a bigger threat".*<br />

>INTERIOR - Orlana Lounge: Having dealt with the Tribble catastrophe, the Lister crew have been invited to the performance of the Andoria Philharmonic at the Gala. The crew have come in their dress uniforms, and are chatting by the bar about their recent mission<br />

**Throk:** Throk especially like part where mighty Voth Security Chef make thousands of BBQ Tribbles and become #1 favorite celebrity streaming chef on Gorn streaming service.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I can't believe you guys were almost killed by Tribbles<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah, they pay me 0.00000000004 ounces of latinum for every bottle of hotsauce they sell with my face on it! What a deal!<br />
**Throk:** Throk also realize in this experience that Gorn mistranslate all communications with Starlfeet. For long years we thought Starfleet had Chief of Security, but instead, have Security Chef.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Does not such a branding agreement violate Starfleet regulations?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Um....Errrrr.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, don't be a narc<br />
**Throk:** Throk think it barbaric to use cattle brand on great dinosaur like Zox.<br />
*Skig is busy upgrading all the power plants and security systems at the research facility, and not available in this scene.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Not if the profits are given to chairity! What, did you think I was a cold blooded dinosaur?<br />
>As the crew chat, Viraseti and Zerra come into the lounge together, significantly later than the rest of the senior staff<br />

**Kolea:** Those two look quite happy now that Viraseti is single and they can freely shag each other without pesky laws calling it "adultery".<br />
*Zox looks at the now putative couple and wonders how effective naked wrestling really was. Gah, mammals, ya know?*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** yeah, I can't believe I had no idea they were a thing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I guess it makes sense.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I didn't even know Viraseti was married<br />
*Kolea shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's hard to tell sometimes when there's distance between active work and their personal life<br />
*Geret appears to dig the formal dress and classy event.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk just happy he was allowed to eat all the BBQ Triibble he could at the Research Station Buffet before we left orbit.<br />
**Throk:** Throk slightly sad Skig not allow any Tribbles on the ship.<br />
*Zox passes Throk some Pepto and anti-acids.*<br />
*Throk etas them, bottle, labels, and caps.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I am not sure you should be eating the tribbles, what if you accidentally eat still-viable Tribble eggs or something<br />
**Throk:** They crunchy but good.<br />
