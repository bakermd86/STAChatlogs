<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): As soon as Kolea notices the Changeling Suit is missing, she is going to contact Dr Malov and warn him that Jasanis is on the ship, running free, and has the Changeling Suit so he needs to lock everything down. She will remind him that Orions do not have sex with corpses, so "No Playtime if you die".</font><br />


>Captains log, Stardate 61714.1: While en route to Starbase 73 to pick up the rest of our crew from leave, we received an unusual distress call from a Federation research outpost in the Orlana system. Our computer records indicate that the outpost only has a small research staff of a few dozen, but the distress claims that they are having a maintenance issue which could threaten trillions of lives. I don't really understand, but to be on the safe side I asked Lt. Commander Skig to put together an engineering team and assess the situation.

Dr. Zerra also tells me that he lost the telemetry from his health monitoring device implanted in Lt. Commander Zox. He says it may just be interference, but just in case I asked Amondi to check if he has any next-of-kin we may need to notify.<br />

>INTERIOR - USS Lister, Transporter room: As Skig gets her away team ready for transport, Lt. Commander Viraseti shows up wearing a tricorder and carrying a PADD.<br />

**Gra'lan:** I've got my slide rule, abacus, and astrolabe packed! Let's see what sort of automata needs some maintenancin!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I hope you don't mind if I join the away team<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, did you remember your sundial and magnetic compass?<br />
*Skig looks at Viraseti.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I do not, any particular reason you want to join us?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yessir Skig-boss! We have full sensors in case of interference!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good, I also want to make sure we can generate inference.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Just in case there's anything unexpected down there, it is a research outpost after all<br />
*Skig wonders if Gra'lan's presence is due to the show picking up the National Antiquarian's Guild as a sponsor.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very well, I was expecting something like your long estranged third cousin was expecting their seventh child and you wanted to visit since we were here.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti squints her eyes and raises an eyebrow at Skig*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or some other plausible reason for you to be very familiar with the situation.<br />
*Skig directs her team to get on the pads.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Four to beam down.<br />
>INTERIOR - Orlana Conservation Research: Skig and her team materialize on the planet's surface, ready for a plasma leak, out-of-control fire, fusion reactor overload, or other catastrophic maintenance issue warranting a distress call. Instead, they see a lot of people milling around, chatting, drinking coffee, and generally not seeming overly concerned.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, the coffee machines are working.<br />
>The outpost has a pleasant, naturalistic aesthetic. Lots of greenery, no alarms or signs of danger are present<br />

**Gra'lan:** sneezes<br />
*Gra'lan: snezes*<br />
*Skig channels her inner Zox and Murry and calls down an orbital strike on the facility while rampaging around as a radiation infused kaiju.*<br />
>A short Tellerite man with a thick mustache comes running over, breathing heavily and sweating profusely.<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Just kidding.</font><br />
**Yalak:** Oh thank goodness you're here<br />
**Gra'lan:** What seems to be the trouble? Other than these blasted plants getting busy with the atmosphere?<br />
**Yalak:** Oh thank goodness you're here<br />
**Yalak:** It's better if I show you, come with me<br />
*Gra'lan: continues sneezing from the plants*<br />
*Yalak leads the away team to a large lecture hall which is set up with symphony seating on the stage*<br />
**Yalak:** Observe please<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very well.<br />
*Yalak plays a note on the piano on the stage, and the sound system begins making increasingly awful feedback sounds from the loud speakers, quickly becoming so loud as to be painful*<br />
*Skig observes what the attractive Tellerite wishes to show her.*<br />

**Yalak:** You see the problem?<br />
*Yalak turns off the sound system and the feedback dies down*<br />
**Oakadan:** No, but I heard a problem. What happened? <br />
**Gra'lan:** Is this...Disaster Area?<br />
**Yalak:** Yes, this is a huge disaster<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
**Yalak:** Trillions of lives are at stake<br />
**Gra'lan:** eh?<br />
*Yalak nervously wipes sweat from his brow*<br />
**Oakadan:** Perhaps you should back up a step, and walk us through what the purpose of this is<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Are you by any chance counting the lives of all the airborne bacteria coming from the plants suffering an untimely death due to acoustic assault?<br />
**Yalak:** This is our lecture hall, normally it is used for symposia that we host here. But this week is our annual gala and we have the Andoria Philharmonic to play a selection of the great Andorian composers for our board of directors<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do things other than the piano operate normallly?<br />
**Yalak:** No, it is the entire sound system. Any music feeds back horribly<br />
**Yalak:** It will completely ruin the concert<br />
**Gra'lan:** How does that put trillions of lives in the balance?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan, this looks like some sort of cross-wiring situation of the analog to digital convergence system. Can you see if you can give it a tune-up while I check on something?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yes sir! Right away!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oakadan, with me.<br />
**Gra'lan:** I mean..Yes mam!<br />
*Skig heads back out of the room.*<br />
**Yalak:** This planet is a wildlife refuge for thousands of critically endangered species.  Our annual gala ensures we get the needed political support from the Federation Science Foundation to continue our work here<br />
*Gra'lan produces a 'Baby's first wiring kit by Radio Shack' box and begins working.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Sweet, is that the one with or without the "lick here" wiring for the batteries?</font><br />
>Skig leads Oakadan out of the lecture hall, following her tricorder. She sees Viraseti having a heated discussion with a human scientist in his mid-to-late 40s<br />

*Skig patiently observes whatever conversation Viraseti is having that distracted her.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No, we came out here responding to a distress call <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But while I'm here...<br />

*Skig offers some popcorn to Oakadan.*<br />

*Dr. Gallego accepts the PADD, then runs away*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(whispers back)*: No, I'm pretty sure Gra'lan will start the entire building on fire shortly and that will distract us.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(whispers further)*: Nevermind.<br />
**Oakadan ** *(murmurs)*: I'd like to slip around and ask for his viewpoint on all of this, if that's okay? Virasti should be able to assist you<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti grunts in frustration, then turns around and sees Skig and Oakadan*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Why don't you two go fix something<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(whispers)*: Oh sure, don't get shot. The Lister's fire suppression system needs it's annual maintenance next month.<br />
*Skig looks at Viraseti.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Rather strangely, I see something right in front of me that looks like it needs fixing.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I thought the Klingons killed all the Tribbles<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Tribbles have proven to be almost impossible to exterminate. The best we can hope for is a Klingon Ship Cat.<br />
*Yalak comes over, drawn by the smell of extra crispy Tribble*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent work Gra'lan, can you work with that handsome Yalak chap to make sure the conduit ducting is safe from further infestation and then we can work out a safe transport method for any surviving ones?<br />
*Yalak blushes slightly*<br />
**Yalak:** Oh well, I don't think you'll be transport the Tribble population. They have really thrived on this continent<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In that case, we shall just need to Tribble-proof things a bit.<br />
**Yalak:** so much so that they have displaced all of the other land animals from this continent and we have had to resettle them on other land masses<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yeah, we aren't solving this with engineering. This system might need an ecological solution.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** By definition, is that not the example of an invasive species?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Anything I put to insulate the wires is probably gonna get chewed through<br />
**Yalak:** This is a wildlife refuge, and this is the last known population of Tribbles in the Alpha Quadrant<br />
**Gra'lan:** Best you could do is put a big pile 'a grain somewhere and distract them until this concert is over.<br />
*Skig secretly suspects this is a problem Neraran is ideally suited to resolve.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah, my mistake.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I thought the Tribbles were present on other systems?<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Gra'lan): Daleks are teh solution to Tribbles.</font><br />
**Yalak:** Not since the Klingons declared them a mortal enemy of the Empire<br />
**Yalak:** They fought a decades long campaign to exterminate them<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This does explain why the "Gift Box of Tribbles" on Bajor-a-zon Primt has gone up in price so much and they do not ship to Klingon space since the times of Montgomery Scott.<br />
**Yalak:** Yes, shipping a box of tribbles through Klingon space would be considered trafficing in illegal weapons and would warrant a death penalty under Klingon law<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In any case, it is a known quantity, let's find an engineering solution to keep the sound system safe and the Tribbles content and happy.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Well, it's true Skig. Ecology is just a degenerate form of engineering. How to contain an r regulated, invasive species for a week?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's the spirit, let me know if you need T'Kor's help to cook something up.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): ...I hope you all appreciate that...</font><br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I will look at the literature, it is pretty unusual for such a sedentary species to cause an issue like this<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have certainly not heard of something like it happening before<br />
*Gra'lan looks at Viraseti.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Ma'm. I think they are hungry as heck.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thank you Lisa.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Some jerk probably left behind half eaten food in the seating, and that drove the little snuggle-poos nuts<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan, they were not by any chance using Platarium XC axial coating on the acoustic systems wiring?<br />

**Gra'lan:** I don't think they were. I didn't know they had to teethe.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It was removed from the approved cabling list on starships about fifty years ago, but the Lister has it on Decks 7-24 and getting replacement cabling is quite challenging.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** They love to gum the coating off the cabling, which exposes the core and causes them to start burning.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very unfortunate.<br />
**Gra'lan:** May I suggest we update the transporter saftey protocols to avoid getting them onboard?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent idea.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Any other items before I update the Captain?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Also, anyone eat these things here? I was going to throw them out, but if any species finds them tasty, who am I to judge?<br />
*Skig sends an update to Captain Baras on the situation that the problem seems to be a troubling but benign Tribble infestation and Skig recommends the Transporter protocols get updated to screen for Tribbles due to the presence of the wiring on the ship which the Tribbles would find delicious.*<br />
>EXTERIOR - Jem'Hadar Colony: Murry, Zox, Kolea and the Twins have been put up in a comfortable pair of rooms constructed from what looks like the wreckage of a Starfleet vessel. A Nebula class warp nacelle and part of a saucer section can be seen crashed into the mountain range in the distance, along with the front half of a Jem'Hadar battleship. The grounds of the colony are green and pleasant though, with logs of Jem'Hadar dressed in a variety of different styles of clothing engaging in a variety of leisure activities like Yoga, mediation, pottery, knitting, etc.<br />

**T'Pau:** We have little reason to withhold any information from you<br />
**T'Pau:** Now that our contract with Jasanis is complete<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can you tell us more about the Founders, and what would cause one to pose as a Starfleet Officer?<br />
**T'Pau:** The Founders went to war with Starfleet, many of them posed as Starfleet officers<br />
**T'Pau:** Just as many Starfleet officers conduct espionage against the enemies of the Federation<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How much do you know about Jasanis's secret contact?<br />
**T'Pau:** I do not know what contacts she may or may not have, just that she claimed she could produce Ketracel White<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So she contacted you?<br />
**T'Pau:** Based on the notes she beamed down when she fled, she had to capture a Founder and use its morphogenic matrix as part of the production process<br />

>The feed from the bug starts up and you see the inside of the cargo hold on Jasanis' ship, you see her talking to Dr. Malov <br />

**Dr. Malov:** Are you sure about this?<br />
**Jasanis:** It'll be fine, it should be fine. I think it's fine. Is it fine?<br />
**Jasanis:** Just get out of here before I change my mind<br />
*Dr. Malov nods and leaves*<br />
>The Jem'Hadar particle canister dematerializes from the cargo bay on Jasanis' cruiser and materliazes on a landing pad in a busy spaceport somewhere.<br />

>Jasanis sits akwardly on top of another canister holding a trigger device similar to the one she used on Ilitz Prime. She is fidgeting with the trigger mechanism, and occasionally whistling a tune.<br />

>A few minutes later, a Cardassian male and a Trill female wearing unremarkable civilian clothes materialize near the canisters. They are standing in the shadows, and keep their heads down, so you can't see their faces very well on the feed. Jasanis activates the dead-man switch on the trigger device and holds it out prominently.<br />

**Cardassian Male:** What is that supposed to be?<br />
**Jasanis:** A detonator. Just some insurance, you know? In case... You know, so that to make sure that you release the funds from escrow. Otherwise, boom!<br />
>Jasanis chuckles nervously.<br />

**Cardassian Male:** How dramatic. I'll call off the orbital strike.<br />
>Jasanis looks up at the sky and ducks behind a crate.<br />

**Trill Female:** That was a joke, relax. We'll authorize the funds transfer as soon as we verify the contents.<br />
>The Trill female takes out a scanner of some kind and begins to scan several canisters. As she does, Jasanis stands back up, crosses, uncrosses, then re-crosses her arms.<br />

**Trill Female:** Energy readings are consistent with what we expected, it looks like it is good.<br />
**Jasanis:** Of course it is, I always keep my word.<br />
**Cardassian Male:** I seriously doubt that. I'll transfer the funds now and you can be on your way.<br />
>The Cardassian taps some commands into a PADD. A few moments later, Jasanis' PADD chimes and she checks it, then disarms the trigger device.<br />

**Jasanis:** Looks like everything is in order, I'll just be...<br />
>Jasanis is cut off when a disruptor shot comes whizzing in from some unseen distant point. She is instantly disintigrated. The other people milling around the spaceport start running for cover while the Cardassian and the Trill turn and look at each other.<br />

**Cardassian Male:** Well that was awefully public, I suppose they don't teach the fine art of "subtlety" at the academy.<br />
**Trill Female:** What do you mean, that wasn't me. I was going to beam a bomb onto her ship when she beamed out. I thought that was you.<br />
**Cardassian Male:** I am hurt that you would think so little of me. That I would assasinate a valued business partner. In such a sloppy manner. Nevertheless, we shouldn't linger too long... Sweep the canisters for bugs and let's get out of here.<br />
>The Trill female taps some commands into her scanner, and the signal from the bug cuts out a few moments later.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That was unexpected<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Very unexpected. Why wait until Jasanis gets paid?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can we get a forensic voice analysis on that?<br />
**Kolea:** I feel bad for Jasanis, although this does happen to Orion's who are one day from retirement.<br />
**Kolea:** It's why I refuse to retire.<br />

**Kolea:** We saved a copy of that recording for forensic voice analysis on everyone talking, right?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes.<br />
**Kolea:** That was not a live feed?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Unfortunate.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well this complicates matters. <br />
**T'Pau:** It is logical to assume that Jasanis' buyers would want her dead, she is in a dangerous line of work<br />

**Kolea:** She was a loose end that we had successfully tracked down a few times.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, I do believe we must cut our sabbatical short here. There are now many at risk from those weapons.<br />
**T'Pau:** You are free to leave at any time<br />
**Kolea:** If anything our ability to track her down made her a liability to both the person she owed money to and the buyers. Either would see her dead to cover their tracks.<br />

**T'Pau:** Good luck on your journey<br />
**T'Pau:** I hope you are not killed<br />
**Kolea:** Good luck in your search for peace and White.<br />

>INTERIOR - Orlana Conservation Research: Oakadon and Dr. Gallego are chatting over a cup of coffe when Skig and the rest of the team catch up to them.<br />

**Dr. Gallego:** You see: the challenge here is re-introducing these species into new environments and constructing a stable food chain on each landmass that will be self-sustaining<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** The old days of dumping a bunch of tribbles into a complex ecosystem and letting them run havoc don't fly anymore<br />
*Skig drinks coffee slowly, savouring the rich aroma of natural coffee beans instead of replicator generated ones.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Neither does the old days of deadbeat husbands refusing to sign divorce papers<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Oh my, look at the time<br />
*Skig thinks to herself, "Tellerite deadbeat husbands do fly, by trebuchet per court order."*<br />
*Dr. Gallego jumps up to flee but suddenly grabs at his stomach*<br />
