>INTERIOR - Janeway's Cabin: Admiral Janeway is interrupted by the sound of struggle as a Jem'Hadar dressed in all-black bursts through the door to her office. Janeway reaches for a phaser, but the Jem'Hadar opens fire before she can reach it. Outside the door, the security guard is laying on the ground in a pool of blood.<br />

Is that even going to come off? It looks like it is chemically bonded to her skin.
