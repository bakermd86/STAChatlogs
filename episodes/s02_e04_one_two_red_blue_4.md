>INTERIOR - Sickbay: As the crew finish up their treatments, several crewmembers from Dr. Skig’s Lister rush in. They are carrying a crewman with a severely lacerated chest. They run over to the number dispenser machines and grab a red number for “Life Threatening Emergencies”<br />

**Injured Crewman** Yes, painkillers would be great<br />
**Injured Crewman** We were working on a replicator controller near junction A14. I heard something odd from inside the maintenance hatch and poked my head in. Then something fell on me from above, scratched and clawed me, and then ran off down the jeffries tube<br />
*Injured Crewman looks back at Skig*<br />
**Injured Crewman** "Best ship in starfleet"? Am I get transferred ma'am?<br />

*Injured Crewman lays back in his chair and stares up at the ceiling.*<br />
**Injured Crewman** Do you ever think about how there's no up and down in space?<br />
**Injured Crewman** Up and down are just like... constructs<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** All the time, it is one of the great mysteries, just like how we are all assigned to the ships we pass the qualification exam for.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The kaleidoscope anomaly has fractured the Lister across dozens of transdimensional instances of itself and we Skigs need to put it back together.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** That explains a few things, we lost connection to all of our automation controllers throughout the ship<br />

*Skig suspects Murry was not being entirely sincere with that "Thanks", but really cannot tell.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** T'Kor and I have been working on modifying the internal sensors to give us readings on what is going on inside the Lister<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I suspect you are no longer attached to the rest of the Lister as you know it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** My working theory is we will need to inject a warp core transmodal spike through both nacelles, adjusting the phase to match the major ship power reading for each deck so we effectively shake every Lister back to its original dimension.<br />
