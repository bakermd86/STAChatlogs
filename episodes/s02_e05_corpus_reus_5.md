>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: The senior staff converge on the briefing room under the faint blue glow of the emergency lighting. As they arrive, they enter to find Ensign Ghex lighting candles and placing them on the briefing room table.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** What's with the candles?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh, you know I figured since it was kind of dark with the emergency lighting and we need to keep power usage to a minimum to avoid giving away our position to the Roral, the candles seemed like a nice way to brighten up the room a little bit.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We still have men on the station, don't we?<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Malat wordlessly flicks on a standard issue flashlight and pulls the jacket forward to convert it to lantern mode.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, I left a security team behind<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** This is amazing planning Ghex. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So we need to create a diversion before we can pick up our crew and warp out.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Or we can just hide and hope they don't notice us, I powered everything down and used the maneuvering thrusters to match the drift of the surrounding junk vessels. The Lister is pretty old, so we kind of also look like space junk. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Umm....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** But we still have the crew on the station, they'll certainly go there<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, I don't think hiding is going to work long term, once they figure out that we were on that medical ship they're going to search the yard<br />
*Skig contemplates spacing Ghex, but realizes that would probably get Bachar mad at her.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** And we still have a few of them frozen....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yerp.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Either our saboteur onboard or the broken ODN line will have tipped them off that someone has been nosing around, and that someone was unlikely to escape. I would not give us a long time before they locate "Constitution-shaped object" among the debris.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I'm inclined to agree, Ghex may have bought us a little time but we shouldn't get comfortable here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** They're probably the ones who set up all the mines over there as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** We need an escape plan, suggestions?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm surprised they were able to get here so quickly<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What direction did they appear from?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well... so ma'am, the thing is, I originally thought that the signal from the Roral was just interference. So I was actually trying to apply a high pass filter to the navigational sensors to filter it out, rather than get a precise bearing. Which is to say, that I um... didn't really take a bearing on it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** You are sure its the Roral, though? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh yeah, it exactly matches the warp signature that Lt. Commander Viraseti reconstructed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** What if we magnitize their hull and turn all the garbage into a weapon? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We could use the maneuvering thrusters to point us at a clear path from the debris field, use the particle injection matrix to immediately jump to warp after we remove the safety overrides from the ship and then kick us into warp 7. Of course, there is a reason Starfleet has removed that option from every other ship in the fleet. Something about fusing all organic matter into the bulkheads.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well, that would certainly distract them for a bit. I'm not sure how we would magnetize their hull though.<br />
*Skig reconsiders now that she is First Officer.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Given the mines they have scattered throughout, it'd probably do more than distract<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Wow, so uhm.. Well the first officer's plan is interesting, but I think that it would reduce the crew to a uniform homogenate.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Actually, let's not do my idea until we run out of others.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes Ghex, there is a chance we would all turn into sentient doors.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Geret already does that frequently enough<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** They realistically do not know what ship is here. We could launch a shuttlecraft and have it distract the Roral away from the Lister.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Did anyone spot any ships that would be a good contender? If we find a good one, we could lure the Roral close to one of the mines like that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** A good EVA spacewalk! Just what we needed!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Kal'aakor's station is still powered up.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Alright, but you need to be extremely careful<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yes Ma'am!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We need to pick up the people over there anyway, we don't we just activate his sensors/scanning/defense grid and pick the Roral as the target for "failure to pay"?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** These are anti-ship mines, so your EVA suits will be too small to set off their proximity sensors. But if you accidentally set one off, you'll all be instantly vaporized<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Windbloom likes vaping though. <br />
*Zox smirks at camera.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh, that's a really good point, Skig<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** There's no reason we can't do both. Zox can lead the team to reprogram the mines, Skig and I can head over to the station<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Hit them from both sides<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Probably don't be near the mines when we set things off, though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well be far away if we get started soon<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That works for me.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I also wouldn't want to be on the station when it opens fire, the Roral will shred that place in a matter of seconds once it responds<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I will make sure to save a copy of Zox and everyone with him in the Transporter Buffer.<br />
*Skig issues a fire extinguisher to Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Thanks!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I'll have the transporters on standby, if you set off the mine I'll try to beam you out. But if it comes to that, it will give away our position.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** But giving away our position is probably better than you being turned into a loose collection of atoms spread over half the salvage yard. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Let's to avoid that outcome. Assemble your away teams, dismissed.<br />

In the distance, they can see the Roral, hanging ominously in space just outside the salvage yard.

I was planning on sending them a cryptic message, just a partial one, but if I do that then they'll go after the real spy and question her.
