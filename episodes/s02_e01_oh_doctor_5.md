>The Cardassians lead the team through the lobby and into a lift, where they are taken to a higher floor. Once there, they are lead to the office of "Second Junior Assistant To The Ambassador" Kovar<br />

*Skig waits patiently for everyone to get through security while giving the dog some kibble, thinking that if this was a damaged plasma coil she would make sure it had energy.*<br />

>In the office, they see an old man in a brown cardigan sweater who is washing paint from his hands in a small sink, next to an easel placed by the window. On it, is an impressionist oil painting of the distant Marrakesh skyline<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Indeed. Impressive painting, I like what you have done with the lighting effects and the mixture of sand and stars to create a dichotomy.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** Most kind of you to say, I took up the hobby several years ago at the urging of a friend<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** The humans are a curious bunch, wouldn't you agree?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** I will pass that along to the ambadassor, however she is unlikely to grant that request given the pending asylum request<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** Your diminuitive friends seem a bit paranoid. Perhaps they have a hint of Cardassian in them<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** I have been following you for some time now, do you know what mistake everyone keeps making? They underestimate you<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Nonsense, if it doesn't involve Lister's Engineering Systems, Skig probably paid NO attention to what was being said, but I doubt Junior Assistant Kovar would agree with that without knowing more about her.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** They assume that because you seem to be a bunch of imbiciles on an old ship, that you can be lead around by the nose. But there is an old human saying I am quite fond of: A chain is only as strong as its weakest link<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ambadassor.png" alt="Junior Assistant Kovar" width="50" height="50">**Junior Assistant Kovar** And Starfleet is no weak chain, so I am not going to make the same mistake as them. <br />
