*Skig uses Zox's tricoder to power up a terminal to pull up the security logs.*<br />
**Kurij:** Between the huge tractor beam emitter and the logs, it seems like this is a salvage ship sent out here to pick something up which wasn't as intended. There's probably something of interest in the cargo bays<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, Dr Zerra, can you pinpoint the faint lifesigns we detected from the Lister?<br />
*Zox Nods at Kurij but looks intent at deciphering something on a screen.*<br />

Dr. Zerra, can you monitor our stress and aggression hormone levels and report any changes - I suspect whatever is on that ship is partially responsible.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well your agression hormones are off the chart, but that is consistent with your last physical<br />

**Kurij:** It'll be a good idea to remain in suits for now as well<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The suits may not protect against sound and light based hypnosis weapons. Be careful.<br />
*Zox races after what might seem to be some motion down a dark corridor.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Captain, the Taganites were salvaging a Federation vessel. Do we have access to Federation logs for vessels in the area that have gone missing or been destroyed lately and what their most recent assignments were?<br />
*Skig walks along behind bullrushing Zox, being cautious and scanning for movement and atmospheric or environmental anomalies.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Nothing recently, but we lost many ships in this area during the war<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Understood Captain, thank you.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I can have the twins start to put together a list of ships lost in this area<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That might be helpful while we collate more data.<br />
**Kurij:** If I can get eyes on the vessel that's probably in the cargo bay, I can probably narrow down the search a lot<br />
**Kurij:** I've seen a lot of different ships<br />
**Kurij:** Who here thinks we should split up?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Let's head to the lifesigns first and see if there are people to rescue. Then we will move into the cargo area and get you that information.<br />

>INTERIOR - Taganite Freighter: Zox clings to the limp body of the Taganite who charged at him and collapsed in his arms, Dr. Zerra takes out his medical tricorder to check on him, as Commander Skig had ordered<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am not an expert in Taganite physiology, but it seems that his neural patterns are scrambling the medical tricorder. I'm not able to get any coherent readings of his brain activity<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** His heart is still beating, but his physical condition implies some neurological issue that the tricorder can't pinpoint<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... Dr. Zerra, analysis?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** There is still a second lifeform, about 60 meters from here<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I am not sure about the risk to the ship by beaming a lifeform to the Lister when we are unsure of the necessary containment protocols.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have every faith in your quartantine buffers and fields.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would prefer not to give Hailey an excuse to blow more holes in the Lister.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Very well<br />

**Kurij:** So the Bolian looked like she should be dead, right?<br />
**Kurij:** And these bodies also look like they're supposed to be dead<br />
**Kurij:** Can we, I dunno, scan a couple to make sure? <br />
>Skig and Zox lead the away team through the ship to the main cargo bay, when they get there, they find that the door has been welded shut by a phaser.<br />

*Skig goes to find the alternate Jeffries Tube entrance to the cargo bay while Zox tries to tear the door open.*<br />

*Skig is impressed that Ishemok can sound exactly like Zox, and remembers that in case it becomes important for shipwide announcements.*<br />

**Ishemok:** Rule 208: Sometimes the only thing more dangerous than a question is an answer. <br />

>MEANWHILE.... INTERIOR - Sickbay: Zox and Murry are escorted to Sickbay by Nurse Kolea to recieve medical care after their near death experience in the briefing room. Dr. Zerra is examining the patients brought over from the Taganite frieghter<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** My tail hurts<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well lets get you on the scanner and see what ails you<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you, Dr Zerra<br />
*Dr. Zerra guides Zox onto a medical bed*<br />
**Kolea:** Hello Doctor. Zox seems to have developed several boo-boos and Counselor Murry's frontal lobe damage from her rampant alcoholism seems to have triggered some violent neurosis.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** What happened anyways? Nurse Kolea reported you all suffered from oxygen deprivation?<br />
**Kolea:** Oh, that also.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig broke my arm<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): I doubt anyone would believe that, but maybe...</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Zox has given me multiple concussions<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, Zox appears to have broken 2 bones in his arm, fractured his clavicle and his skull and ruptured one of his kidneys<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I can see why the entire crew of the other ship wound up dead<br />
*Dr. Zerra begins administering care to Zox and gets his arm set in a bone regenerator*<br />
*Kolea gets out the "chart of Zox injuries" that they keep on the inner board of the daily check sheet for Physician on Duty and checks off any new boxes.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Whew.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That should only take 10-15 minutes to set, but try not to break it again today<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): (BINGO!)</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's okay, the paleo diet keeps me healthy!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Nurse, make sure to note down the ruptured kidney. That's a new one.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And check if anyone has BINGO yet<br />
**Kolea:** Nurse Yulari has a bingo for kidney rupturing, I believe she gets the decorative floral arrangement.<br />
*Hailey Murry overlooks the clear conflict of interest in the medical bay having bets for injuries that people sustain*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Now, as for you Counselor. What is this about your frontal lobe?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I've been seeing things since earlier today, so I'd like to have that looked into. I thought it was just a migraine<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(quietly)*: It caused me to suplexed Kolea, so she's holding a grudge<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And Nurse Kolea mentioned alchoholism? You know, we do have a certified substance abuse counselor on board<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes, that would be me<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Let me check, her name is... Murry... Oh, right. Nevermind<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That's alright. It's not the alcohol, it's the grudge<br />
**Kolea:** I only hold grudges against slavers and women who steal my bedmates.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well if you're having headaches and hallucinations, we should probably have a look<br />
**Kolea:** And... well... you don't qualify for the second, so unless you are the first, we should be good. I'm just going off what the tricoder tells me.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do recent concussions count? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Because otherwise, not that I'm aware of<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** No, this is old scar tissue.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** At least a few years, possibly 10-12 <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is difficult to know exactly when, but you have a lot of scarring along your prefrontal lobe<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that sounds pretty terrifying<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, it must have been here for a long time<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is so subtle it would have never been picked up in a standard physical<br />
*Dr. Zerra walks over to his computer*<br />
*Kolea notes on medical record, "Subject of brain experimentation she doesn't remember."*<br />
*Zox makes a note in his 'understand humans' journal on the origin of the phrase 'scared for life'.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Interesting, looking at your physical from when you came on board, there is a small shadown on the scan here. It isn't large enough to have been flagged at the time, but it is in the exact same location. So this scarring doesn't appear to be new.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But I don't see any evidence of incisions, or other scarring around the area<br />
*Hailey Murry is secretly quite relieved it's not some sort of recently developed brain-scarring*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I don't know how this scarring could have been caused, it would have required something to interact with your brain without having gone through your skull or surrounding tissues<br />
*Zox goes into hibernation.*<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think Skig replaced all the batteries with cheap ones she got from Radio Shack. That's the reason it broke!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were attempting to report it as a potential security breach<br />
**Kolea:** Doctor, do you suppose it was performed via some sort of advanced inter-cranial operation via nanomachines fed into her via her nasal passages, which is the shortest route to the human brain and a cause of why Orion women can cause human females to behave violently due to our pheromone signature?<br />

**Kolea:** When one is a slave working in the medical malpractice division of the Orion Syndicate, one does learn a few things.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, I am afraid that is a little outside my area of expertise. All I can say is that whatever did this didn't cut through her skull to do it. It's as if it materialized in there<br />
**Kolea:** Interesting, pinpoint beaming of brain matter in and out via transporter has also been discussed; however, every medical journal I have seen on the matter has suggested it does not work to rehabilitate violent criminals without reducing them to a vegetative state.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, a transporter lobotomy would have probably caused some more noticeable side-effects in the Counselor<br />
**Kolea:** To be fair, those medical journals were also part of the Orion Syndicate Medical Professional Journal of "How To Deal With Federation Officers".<br />
*Kolea scratches head.*<br />
**Kolea:** Curious how we consider the Federation to be violent criminals.<br />
*Kolea shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps not a transporter then, there are many ways to pass solid objects through one another: phasic cloaks, spacial folding, subspace transit, transwarp tunnels, wormholes<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Although a wormhole in the Counselors brain seems unlikely<br />
**Kolea:** Good point. Perhaps vivisection is the best way to evaluate further. I'll prep the anesthetic.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I was going to say, those sound like they also have notable side effects<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think not right now, not when we've had sabotage happen so recently and have a ship we need to recover<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Isn't that incredible!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We were tracking the ends of the subspace string that is wrapped around the ship and causing mental instability in most of the inhabitants of the ship and likely led to the neural incapacitance of the entire Taganite crew.<br />
**Kolea:** Don't forget you were also on your way to the bake sale the enlisted were holding on deck 14.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wha-? How's it stuck in my brain? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That is a good question.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That I can't say, some exploratory brain surgery might give us a better idea<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, perhaps you could help Dr Zerra get that ready?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we do some less exploratory brain scans instead? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This doesn't seem proper.<br />
*Skig looks at Dr Zerra behind Viraseti's back and makes the, "please stab with knock out drug" hand sign.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Sickbay is still flooded with neurozine gas, I can't do any brain surgery or brain scans from a jeffries tube<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though we may have to wait, Zox flooded deck 6 with Nerouzine<br />
**Kolea:** Nonsense, taking out the brain for examination before surgery was quite common in some cultures.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't see how this works unless you have a subspace scalpel.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well doctor, might I suggest we use the secondary medical facilities on deck 8?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** They are not as well equipped, but should be servicable as the Lister's Advanced Sickbay facilities are spread through several decks.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We can take turboshaft 7 down to exit 4, then cross corridor 14 to encounter the least number of obstacles and the shortest path.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we're going to do any sort of medical things on my brain, we'll need someone to keep the Captain busy<br />
**Kolea:** I can give him a sensuous massage.<br />

*Hailey Murry looks over Virasetti's shoulder, pointing at readings*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Based on Ishemok's scans, it looks to me like the coiling of string has created both a subspace capacitance and inductance which are causing the string to draw neural patterns from both ends. Like a coil of wire acting as an electrical transformer and capacitor at high frequencies<br />

*Dr. Zerra pulls up an image on the monitor as he scans Murry's brain*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The string seems to lead right to this spot here in your prefrontal cortex. It looks like the spot is surrounded by a small collection of scar tissue<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is extremely small, less than 12 micros<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: microns*</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But the scar tissue looks old, at least 5-10 years <br />

**Kurij:** Hold on, what is *it*? <br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How on earth would that have happened? <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That is possible, we could have easily missed something this small when we examined her<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Who is this person?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Wait that doesn't make sense, unless they were on the freighter?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** According to Murry, the other Federation officer is a member of a group of mutineers.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** According to the Captain, so are we<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Federation officer who was recovered from the brig of the Taganite freighter.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I can't think of anything that could have happened during the mutinee to have triggered something like this<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we just stick her on a shuttle and send her off and away? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't worry Dr. you have been held against your will the entire time on threat of being eaten by Zox and as a result are blameless in this situation.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well surely whatever caused it would have happened before the mutiny Counselor<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I surmise that would merely stretch the cosmic string out and create a tympanic response when it reached its limit before snapping back in an uncontrolled direction that might damage my beautiful Lister.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, would you agree with my hypothesis on the result of separating the two of them?<br />
**Ishemok:** Wait, everyone caught between Murray and her mutineer have been spawning countless mutinies across the depths of space?<br />
**Ishemok:** This...sounds profitable...<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The string is at least tens of thousands of light years in length, and possibly longer. So I wouldn't worry in the near term about it breaking<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do we have to worry about things like knots forming in it or things it might tangle on? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However it is, if I remember correctly, currently coiled around and through the Lister.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, there is really no way to predict what might happen in other locations as a result of the string<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns to Skig*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** In subspace yes<br />
*Skig secretly wonders if using a Klingon Disintegrator on Murry and the other Federation officer would be a good plan of action, but probably not something she should say out-loud.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So the only part of the lister it should directly interact with is our warp field<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't think we can leave it connected to you indefinitely, even if it has been there for 10 years<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We don't know what impacts this may have had on other people in other systems unbeknownst to anyone for the past decade<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or our shielding arrays, as evidenced by the filter I applied which caused a sympathetic vibration throughout the ship.<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Murry could have inadvertently collapsed entire civilizations just by travelling around the sector<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm sure Murry has been blowing up dozens of other unsuspecting starships with her proclivities.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Might I suggest that Hailey Murry and this mutineer need to use constructive dialogue to resolve this subspace gap; clearly something from their past has some sort of pan-dimensional gravity and perhaps needs to be counseled away.<br />
*Kurij stares off into the distance at the thought*<br />
*Hailey Murry stares off into the distance at the thought*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** (delete first)<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Words speak louder than actions, perhaps you are on to something Zox.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Part of the problem is that she's comatose, so we'll have a hard time counseling anything<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Mostly because actions do not speak, but I never claimed Tellerite sayings make sense.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It is possible that the source of all this neural energy is the pre-existing conflict between you two being amplified by the cosmic string<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr Zerra, would it be possible to rouse the officer from a comatose state?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Sticking with the tranformer analogy we have been using: defusing that tension could be like switching the power source from AC to DC<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If that's not dangerous enough, do we have another way to intinate a neural link?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Absolutely, as long as I don't make the same mistake I made with Kolea....<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suppose we could enlist a Vulcan to perform a mind-meld and allow the two of them to communicate using the Vulcan as a medium. Now... do we have any Vulcan's on board?<br />
*Zox Ponders why they don't have a Vulcan or Betazed counselor, but then realizes why he is on the Lister, thus answering his own question.*<br />

**Lt. Jg. Elin:** You're one to talk about ego<br />
>The twins activate Skig's inexplicable door control override program that definitely  violates numerous health and safety standards. Every door aboard the lister begins to slam open and shut at a terrifying speed, threatening the arms of every poorly trained security officer in their vicinity<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Why do you have that pre-programmed into the computers?<br />
**J'Davir:** Ego when used to focus oneself on the good of the ship and society is beneficial, but this unhealthy competition seems to have grown ever out of control. Perhaps a better resolution is what do you find respectable about each other that would act as a conduit to build a basis of trust and cooperation for your sakes and those of your ship mates.<br />

*Ishemok whew.*<br />
*Zox Aww...*<br />
*Ensign Murry is chatting amiably with Elin as they prepare their lunch*<br />
**Ensign Murry:** Oh crap. I think I erased it. Whoops!<br />
*Ensign Murry laughs*<br />
**Ensign Murry:** Do you have a backup?<br />
**Ensign Elin:** No, wait are you serious? You erased my mother's Koror soup recipe?<br />
**Ensign Elin:** I don't have it backed up outside the replicator!<br />
*Hailey Murry gestures to the scene*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Literally started because of an accident<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** Because of carelessness<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** Your carelessness<br />
*Zox doesn't understand why Hailey and Elin don't just settle the dispute with ritual headbutting at high noon.*<br />
*Skig shudders at the concept that a Starfleet officer would be stupid enough to not have six backups, including three in cold storage at different physical locations, for anything of importance.*<br />
*Zox is unimpressed with spicy dialogue, prefering competitive war-trumpeting.*<br />
**J'Davir:** Hmm... Murry, I think there is a time that it is necessary to admit there are valuable cultural differences which have to be overlooked in favor of greater cooperation and understanding.<br />
**J'Davir:** What may seem a trivial accident to you could be a heinous slight to the Bolian. For reference, I recommend mixing raw meat into Zox's salad and see what happens.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That has dietary implications, though...<br />
**J'Davir:** It may seem like a simple accident to you, but as a herbivore who considers raw meat sacriliegous to consume on days not ending in Y, it is traumetic.<br />
**J'Davir:** Hmm... so you are supposing that a Koror Soup Recipe would not contain valuable dietary supplements that might make a Bolian more at ease on a spaceship?<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** Not just "a" Koror soup recipe, my dead mother's Koror soup recipe<br />
**J'Davir:** Exactly, so it is genetically crafted to ensure further mental ease for a particular Bolian.<br />
*Hailey Murry struggles internally with the situation, especially given she's had some professional counseling training now and has a much more mature perspective on the whole ordeal*<br />
**J'Davir:** In essence, what seems like an accident to you, of a recipe shared with you in friendship, was necessary to help Elin survive the rigours of space travel.<br />
*J'Davir looks at Elin.*<br />
**J'Davir:** Were you able to ever recover the recipe?<br />
*Zox Suddenly realizes this entire caper is over a recipie, because beings can't be bothered to have multiple stomachs and need this pre-digested soup thing.*<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** I was going to try to get it off the replicators of my prior posting at Starbase 121, but then the captain went crazy before I had a chance to get back. And after that we were branded as mutineers and couldn't return to a Starfleet facility<br />
*Skig is annoyed at using her really cool Jem Hadar mudering door routine for no reason over a freaking soup recipe.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Bachar to Zox, do you have any explanation for why I am experiencing Counselor Murry's memories?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Did Skig do this?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Commander, no; these hallucinations are 100% psychic and not mechanical in any way.<br />
*Skig sets the sonic shower in Bachar's quarters to "moderate flensing with a side of vivisection".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The entire sector around us has to watch them. <br />
*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
*J'Davir looks at Murry.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** That doesn't exactly put me at ease, but good to know. Also: when this over I want you to conduct a full security review of subroutines that Skig has added to ship's control systems<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Listen, Lt Elin, I really am sorry about losing the recipe. I was back then, too. If it helps, we can probably reach out to Starbase 121 and see if we can delve into the records on their repliactors. See if we can get the recipe back. <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I am fairly certain this door behavior violates protocol<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We are attempting to solve this disruption with a mind meld over tea...Yes of course. I will run such a scan, but it may be part of the new transparency policy, i.e. no closed doors.<br />

**Lt. Jg. Elin:** I will begrudgingly admit that things did get slightly out of hand<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Negative, they are closing approximately the square root of 49 multiplied by the cubic value of the Lister's forward thrust when applied to a rhomboid manipulation of the space-time constant while adjusting for the lava lamp randomness generator in the warp core and divided by the number of remaining crew. If it was 45 times last minute, that is totally coincidental.<br />
*Zox blows a mental circuit trying to understand Skig.*<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** But you're over here with Commander's pips and I've lost the last 10 years. It's not fair<br />
*J'Davir wonders if he can apply to be the Ship's Counselor, as long as he never has to do a session with Skig.*<br />

Starfleet had already dispatched a ship to arrest us, and given the captain's claims that we had mutineed we didn't want to risk it<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** Commander Almu took us into Niberide space to lay low for a while and figure out our options, but then things get foggy...<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** There were some kind of creatures on the ship, or something. People started dieing, and then I have no idea after that<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Fascinating, good work on your detailed scanning records Ensign Ishemok. When this is done, I am definitely having you transfered to stellar phenomena.<br />
**Ishemok:** Oh! That's music to my ears! a promotion!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Music you say? Maybe that would calm down these disturbed psyches...<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It seems that the high reckless mind meld experiment has had an effect on the balance of neurological energy feeding the system. Previously, Elin and Murry were both producing an excess of neurological fields associated with their anger, but now those fields have dissipated <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But as the string is collapsing, it seems to be pulling whatever neurological energy it can from each end<br />
**Ishemok:** Should we all induce sleep and watch it starve?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Like a vacuum, drawing all the air from an open airlock<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Pretty sure that would kill them both<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And possibly J'Davir as well, I am not an expert on mind melds<br />
**Kurij:** Well, that doesn't sound optimistic<br />
**Kurij:** Is there a way that we can each take a bit of the load off so it doesn't kill everyone as it dissipates? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What about all getting super emotional and excited so it drains from all of us instead of these angry people?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Would we rather have it dissipate through starvation, as Ishemok proposed?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Like a blood donor? Interesting idea, but you would need to figure out a way to move it from one of their brains into your own<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And the risks are incalculable<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Don't say it is dangerous, Zox will want to do it even more<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We might also want to consider just breaking the mind-meld; however that would be performed.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I have never dealth with a failing mind meld before, I have no idea the risks if we sever it. If we had a few hours I would consult the medical literature, but I doubt we have that long<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, would it be possible to determine what is causing the string to tether to them?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The string is mostly contained in subspace, so I can think of only 3 possiblities:<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** One: they may have encountered the string during traversal through a wormhole<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Two: They could have hit it at exactly the wrong time while dropping out of warp, when the ship croses though the warp threshold into normal space<br />
*Skig is secretly hoping one of these options involves exploratory brain surgery.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Or Three: If the matter confinement beam of a transporter intersected the string directly<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I could completely imagine the third one being likely given what little I have learned of the situation.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** As to severing it, if we could find way to give the string a tug we could do so just as we also cross a subspace threshold<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** A technical solution presents itself!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Either with the transporter or the warp engines, but I am not sure how we could reliably find a way to "tug" the string<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That seems like an engineering problem, thank you Lt. Cmdr Viraseti<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Apologies for interrupting, but we have completed a full review of all 132,451 published articles on mind melds in the Starfleet medical database<br />
**Ishemok:** Can mind-melds form the basis of more efficient advertising targeting?<br />
**Kurij:** Ishemok, this is not the time<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Severing a mind meld is a generally risky proposition, however a meta-analysis seven years ago by the Daystrom institute found that on average, 40% of mind meld participants survive the severing of a mind meld with no permanent brain damage<br />

We're apparently connected with some sort of telepathic bond, though. Memories and some vocaliazation and sensory crossing<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Skig, replicate this inhibitor that the Ferengi won't stop singing about<br />
**J'Davir:** That was likely a side effect of having the mind-meld broken violently. My apologies<br />
*Skig brings up the standard template for a Torres Inhibitor and creates one in Sick Bay.*<br />
**Ishemok:** We've got to save our crew, no no doctor this won't do, the emotions they all brew, if we don't a patient is gonna sue!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Any risks with this thing we need to know about?<br />
**Ishemok:** Nope.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nope!<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Dr Zerra, how is Lt Elin? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Seems totally acceptable.<br />
*Kolea takes the instruction manual from Skig.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh my gosh I wonder if this is what it's like for the Twins<br />
**Kolea:** You are insufferable!<br />
*Kolea looks at Murry.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Condition stable, though it might be a few hours before she regains consciousness. She's been through a lot<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Ok, if we're satisfied there's no risk then lets do it<br />
**Kolea:** Sorry for channeling my inner Skig there earlier, I shall endeavor to not suggest sedating you prior to letting you get a word in next time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ....but if we put Elin and Murray in different ships, and clothesline the enemy ship between them, we will disable them without firing a shot!<br />
**J'Davir:** This crew apology session warms the cockles of my cold Vulcan heart.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh sorry. I shouldn't be tryign to weaponize this anomaly....<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox, no. Don't even go there.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** but but but...<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Did anything happen?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Or did Zox break it<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I no longer have the string on sensors<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But I...some of the memories are still there<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm going to need some time to sort through this<br />
**Ishemok:** When at first we had no clue, all of us were feelin blue; when we got to inhibition, we had fixed our coooooognition!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I recommend we move out of the area, turn the Inhibitor off and see if Counselor Murry and Lt. Elin are no longer connected. We likely do not want to run a Torres Inhibitor at all times as it could interfere with other ship systems.<br />

**Kolea:** I agree with Skig that we do not want to run this all the time.<br />
>INTERIOR -Crew Lounge: Viraseti, Malat, Bachar, Zox, Murry and Skig are having a drink after their incredibly weird experience<br />

<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): In space, no one can hear you sing</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(mutters under her breath)*: Oh sure, the Commander can suggest spacing people who annoy her, but spacing people to protect the Lister is bad. I see how it is.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): my dice have caused enough harm for one episode...</font><br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Sounds like I missed a pretty wild time in sickbay<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I still do not understand all this sutblety in communications Skig. It baffles me.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nurse Kolea and Dr Zerra performed admirably saving the lives of Lt. Elin and J'Davir.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I was impressed with Ensgin Ishemok, I've already put in for him to be transferred to my department<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I think if he can learn to stop trying to rob everyone all the time, he could grow into a valuable officer<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** He does seem better suited to work in your division than to be third shift left nacelle supervisor.<br />
**Ishemok:** I swear off petty theft forever! For the Federation!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, he had that role because the spinning dart board picked it for him.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I'll approve the personel transfer whenever my command codes are reactivated, it seems the captain locked me out for "leading a mutiny" at some point before we resolved the situation<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I should probably reinstate you and Zox. I think I have that in my To-Do list for tomorrow.<br />
*Skig checks her datapad.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yep.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** but If I am not an officer, then I do not need to obey the officer code of conduct?<br />
*Captain Baras enters the lounge and picks up a drink, then heads over towards the senior staff*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** No, but you still have to obey the more restrictive Redshirt Code of Conduct<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Per Starfleet Code, you are suspended but still an officer, section 19, paragraph 7 Zox.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hello, Captain. Did you have a good mutiny? <br />
*Hailey Murry offers a toast to him*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Skig, I'm going to have to leave in command for a couple of days. Dr. Zerra relieved me of duty for 48 hours while I recover<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey, why does your species not merely headbutt each other till all transgressions are forgotten or forgiven?<br />
*Captain Baras accepts Murry's toast*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Just a headache at this point, nothing too bad<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That's pretty common behavior among the males, but typically it's frowned upon. It's preferred to talk things out<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I understand Captain, I hope you are able to recover. I am sure Nurse Kolea could offer some relaxation routines to help you recover.<br />
*Skig is completely baffled by all the snickering and laughs by 2/3 of the people when she states that.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How's Lt. Elin? <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I'm sure things will be back to normal in a couple of days, just don't do anything too crazy. I can't leave Bachar in command, she's still under an arrest order for leading the mutiny<br />
*Captain Baras chuckles as he walks off*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, so... I should...<br />
*Skig looks at datapad.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm.... the old man is good, he just deleted that section of my to-do list.<br />
*Skig has newfound respect for Captain Baras' hacking skills.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think he actually meant for you to arrest the commander<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nonsense, according to this, I need to reinstate Zox so he can arrest Lt Malat and Commander Bachar. Seems totally plausible as an outcome.<br />
*Zox eats some plant decor and enjoys the serenity.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** You can't be serious<br />
*Zox glances over, realizing that Skig can _only_ be serious.*<br />
*Zox continues grazing.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Is there some other method of operation I should try, Commander?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** You can try comprehending the existence of a joke<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah, I shall give that a thought. Very well, I guess I can postpone this arrest order until after closing time at the bar, try not to start any fights.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** You piece of...<br />
