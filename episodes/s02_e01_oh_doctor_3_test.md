>INTERIOR - Ol' Faithless: Ghex pilots the dubiously space-worthy shuttle out of of orbit, taking care not to incinerate the now dubiously air-worthy shuttle in the transition to atmospheric flight. Skig, Zox and Oakadan man the shuttle's other stations as they begin search operations over North Africa<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Wow, this shuttle has a lot more warning lights illuminated than I am used to. Is it going to explode? I am not really comfortable with vessels I am piloting exploding. It's never happened before.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Well, actually that's not quite true. It's happened once before, but that wasn't my fault and even my instructor said so. She said that the tech manual figure for the pressure tolerance of a type-9 shuttle craft was written given in absolute pressure, but the shuttle display defaults to gauge pressure, which is OBVIOUSLY a lot lower since the shuttle is pressurized. So I didn't even lose points on my shuttle classification exam.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Although I did get docked on my engineering competency score, because I didn't know the difference between aboslute pressure and gauge pressure. But you'd think that they would at least make sure that the display matched the text book?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Sorry, am I talking too much? People tell me sometimes I talk too much, especially when I'm nervous like when I am put on an away mission with the First Officer and the scary officer on my first day piloting a not-at-all standard shuttle through an atmostpheric reentry to some unfamiliar planet. I'll shut up now.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Wait...who is scary here?<br />
*Skig is unsure if Ghex knows which is the First Officer and which is the Scary One.*<br />

*Ensign Ghex tries to change the subject before she puts her foot in her mouth even more*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan:** I think Africa is the one beside the big one<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** That is Madgascar<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** All right, I just need to reroute power through this sparking conduit here to up the sensor power to the 8.1 Jigawatt range, Oakadan, grab that extinguisher and try to get between Ghex and the panel so it doesn't decapitate the pilot like last time.<br />
*Skig is proud of thinking of the crew more than usual.*<br />
>Ol' Faithless bursts expectedly into flames, and Oakadan springs into action with the fire extinguisher<br />
