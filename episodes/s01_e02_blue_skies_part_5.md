>The Jem Hadar soldier doesn't seem too happy about the punch, but otherwise doesn't react too much<br />

**Captain Baras:** Zox, the turbolift!<br />
*Captain Baras signals for Zox to throw the Jem Hadar into the open turbolift*<br />
*Skig imagines Zox ripping the turbolift door from its moorings and caving in the Jem Hadar's head.*<br />
*Skig hopes Zox does not misinterpret Baras' orders like she did.*<br />

>Zox effortlessly pulls the Jem Hadar soldier away from Murry and shoves him into the lift<br />

**Captain Baras:** Deck 2, section 8<br />
>The lift doors close behind the Jem Hadar and the lift whooshes away<br />

**Zox:** Whew, I do not like those beasties.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Thank you for that, Zox<br />
**Captain Baras:** Computer, seal turbolift 3<br />
*Skig checks the nearest monitor for current situation of what is going on in engineering outside the doors of the turbolift.*<br />
>Skig flips through the security monitors, and sees Jem Hadar crawling all over the engineering deck. There are 4 in main engineering itself, and at least half a dozen more spread throughout the deck (not counting any that may be shrouded)<br />

**Captain Baras:** Skig, how did you stop them the first time?<br />
**Captain Baras:** I don't imagine you went in phaser's blazing...<br />
>The Jem Hadar in main engineering appear to be planting some sort of charge on the warp core<br />

*Skig put on a spacesuit and blew a hole in the side of the ship with some explosives and vented them all into space.*<br />
**Skig:** Which is either what I should be doing, or what the version of me in this flashback is currently doing.<br />
**Skig:** I put on a spacesuit and blew a hole in the side of the ship with some explosives and vented them all into space.<br />

**Captain Baras:** It looks like there are at least of them between us and the airlock,<br />
**Zox:** This is a solid plan Skig. What about our own crew?<br />
**Skig:** At this point we may be the only ones left alive down here, I'm not seeing any crew readings on the monitor.<br />
**Zox:** Skig, can you route us to turbolift A?<br />
*Skig checks to see if the turbolifts near the airlock are still functional.*<br />
**Zox:** Second, i will overload this phaser to create a distraction, causing the Jem Hadar's attention away from us.<br />

[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 21]**<br />
**Skig:** There is insufficient power to reroute the turbolifts, so I'm going to drain power from the life support on this level to activate the turbolift controls.<br />
**Zox:** Sounds good to me.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Is that going to be healthy for us?<br />
*Skig types at a rate of 1000 wpm using only flashing green and yellow buttons.*<br />
**Zox:** If you aren't here, how can it be unhealthy for you?<br />
**Computer:** Warning: Life support is now offline. Oxygen will be depleted in 30 minutes.<br />
**Zox:** Bah, plenty of time.<br />
*Zox begins tinkering with a phaser.*<br />
**Skig:** In about 25 minutes Oxygen will be low enough that dependent on your race's need for it, you might start to get a little too happy about your impending death.<br />

*Skig doubles over and begins shaking.*<br />
*Captain Baras gets into another turbolift*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Are you alright commander?<br />
**Skig:** To be fair, I'm a little more worried about the real version of my body giving out before the oxygen supply in this version of the Lister is drained.<br />
*Hailey Murry pats Skig on the back*<br />
**Captain Baras:** In that case, we'd better hurry<br />
*Skig straightens herself up and Picard Manuevers her shirt back into position.*<br />
**Skig:** All right, let's go.<br />
*Zox throws a phaser rigged to detonate in the room immediately north.*<br />

**Zox:** This will distract the simple-minded Jem Hadar<br />
>The turbolift whirrs up two decks, then cuts over and back down to the engineering deck near the airlock<br />

*Zox intelligently hops into the turbotlift to the airlock.*<br />
*Captain Baras starts grabbing space suits out of the lockers and handing them out*<br />
*Skig opens the door to get everyone space suits. Checks to see if Zox's detonated phaser had appropriate effect of opening the ship to vacuum.*<br />
**Skig:** Thank you Captain.<br />
**Zox:  [d20 = 4]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Excellent job, Zox! How did you know they were in there?<br />
**Computer:** Warning: Hull Breach on Engineering Deck. Containment fields: offline.<br />
*Skig opens all the doors on this level to pull the Jem Hadar into the vacuum.*<br />
**Zox:** I have not forgotten the Dominion War. If there's one good trait the Jem Hadar have, it is consistency.<br />
*Skig turns on magnetic boots.*<br />
**Zox:** Also these suits were not made for my kind, and I can no longer manipulate objects as my claws will not fit into the humanoid gloves.<br />

<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): No smell like fresh vaccum.</font><br />
**Skig:** All right, now we just need to go disable the bomb they placed, then I can reconfigure the universal translator through the communication system.<br />
>There is a cacophonous sound as the air rapidly evacuates from the entire engineering deck, followed by total silence in the remaining vacuum<br />

*Skig is not going to fix the "hull breach and vacuum situation" as it is important for purposes of keeping Jem Hadar reinforcements from interrupting them as they come down the turbolift.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Let's hurry up, I don't want to spend any more time in this spacesuit than necessary<br />
*Zox nods in agreement.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I got a C- in EVA at the academy<br />
**Skig:** I was born in a spacesuit, literally. My mother decided overtime while gestating an infant was a great idea.<br />
**Skig:** I understand the space suit was never clean again afterwards.<br />
>The crew akwardly plod along through the engineering deck in their bulky space suits until they reach main engineering and the warp core. Four dead Jem Hadar are laid out on the floor, along with the bodies of most of the engineering crew<br />

*Skig is surprised the dead bodies did not get blown into space also, assumes this is the kind of thing left in place just so people who obsess over the episode have something to complain about.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh, hey, I've seen this model before<br />
**Skig:** Hailey, I would never have expected a ship's counselor to be an expert bomb disposal technician.<br />
>Over by the main engineering console is a cloud of ionic energy in a roughly humanoid shape, wearing the uniform of a Starfleet Chief Petty Officer<br />

**Zox:** Negotiators are experts at diffuisng things. I see nothing wrong with this.<br />

**Skig:** True mental and physical wiring could be perceived similarly.<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Explosives are a fantastic team building exercise <br />
*Skig rearranges the plastoid microphasic auditory incisors to fragmulate the xiphoid constructs.*<br />
*Zox is totally convinced that humans must be the most amicable team players in the universe, given Hailey's comment and the preponderance of humans with 10 functional digits.*<br />
**Skig:** Okay, I think this will either give us the ability to speak with the creature OR will tear open a subspace hole in the side of your head that will feel like your brains are being gnawed apart. Only one way to be sure.<br />
*Skig hands the translator to Hailey.*<br />
**Skig:** Go for it!<br />
*Captain Baras nods approvingly of Skig's excellent command potential*<br />
*Skig push the red glowing button.*<br />
**Skig:** push the red glowing button.<br />
*Hailey Murry gives the device a distasteful look*<br />
*Hailey Murry sighs and hits the button*<br />
*Skig gets behind a strange lead shield that has suddenly appeared next to Captain Baras.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Good afternoon, Petty Officer. Can you understand me?<br />
>The shape responds in the voice of Chief Botok.<br />

**Unknown:** That doesn’t sound like the Skig I know<br />
*Zox has fogged up her space suit and cannot see, bumping into walls, etc.*<br />
**Unknown:** I am a guest on your ship<br />
**Unknown:** Violated some protocols <br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** On this ship in Skig's mind, do you mean? <br />
**Unknown:** Figure out you...Tellerite <br />
**Unknown:** I had to come<br />
**Unknown:** So different<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Ahhh, is it that Skig is uniquely compatible with your frequencies? <br />
**Unknown:** you know...you know...you know your ship<br />
**Skig:** I do know my ship.<br />
**Chief Botok:** I know...Skig...now...know a thing or two<br />
**Skig:** I do know a thing or two. How can we help you?<br />
**Chief Botok:** Damper...Field...protocols...<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Which protocols would you like us to address? <br />
**Chief Botok:** We....invite...Skig.......Figure out...Field...protocols...displace<br />
**Chief Botok:** Figure out... field<br />
**Chief Botok:** I...damper...colleagues...aggression<br />
**Chief Botok:** Skig... guest...displace... Field Dynamics<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** If you can help get us out of here, we can figure out the nuances on the tamper fields<br />
*Chief Botok crackles brightly at Murry's suggestion*<br />
**Zox:** ..and severely discipline those who have harmed you.<br />
**Chief Botok:** Lead the way Lieutenant... I ... damper... colleagues .... aggression<br />
**Skig:** Okay, let's work on this together.<br />
**Captain Baras:** What is it asking us to do exactly?<br />
*Zox keeps on alert, in case any Jem Hadar have cleverly avoided the decompression.*<br />

**Skig:** I postulate it needs out help to modulate the Damper Fields of the Weather Grid to no longer cause mental anguish to the ion entities while also functioning similar to the human version of something called "fly paper".<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** In exchange, this one will pull its colleagues back and allow us some breathing space so we can address it<br />
**Captain Baras:** How do we know they won't simply kill us the moment Skig drops the weather grid?<br />
**Skig:** Right, well done.  By the way, when that red button starts blinking green like that, you need to move the universal translator to the other side of your head or the field harmonics might cause unexpected bowel displacement.<br />
*Skig gestures at the universal translator Hailey is holding.*<br />
*Captain Baras takes a couple of steps back from Murry*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Skig, it seems to be addressing you. Do you trust it?<br />
*Skig looks at Baras.*<br />
*Hailey Murry keeps an eye on the light to make sure she maintains her dignity*<br />
**Skig:** Do we realistically have alternatives? I think it picked the form of Botok because it was able to determine that was most likely to elicit a favorable response.<br />
**Zox:** I agree with Skig.<br />
**Skig:** Paranoidly, I could assume this is all a trap, but as it currently is, I am physically rotting away and waiting around to see what happens there seems like a bad idea.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Then it's agreed. <br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We're lucky that Skig is compatible <br />
**Chief Botok:** Find your way<br />
**Skig:** Yes, when I tried out a dating app a couple years ago, the only things that were compatible showed up as starships capable of Warp 5 or better. I was never presented with a carbon-based lifeform.<br />
**Skig:** This is the first time I've been compatible with an ion storm though, so that is unique.<br />
*Skig tries to determine what "find your way" would mean from the Botok entity.*<br />
**Zox:** Yeah, it's better to be matched to fast ships. Some of the other one' just run on impluse, and you know how those relationships fall apart.<br />
>The lifeform crackles brightly with energy, blinding the entire away team momentarily. When they come to, they are lying on the ground of the planet, in a small 3-meter bubble around the weather grid emitter, surrounded by the raging ionic storms in all directions<br />

**Zox:** Whew.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I repeat: To anyone on the away team that can hear me, you need to disable the weather control grid. You lifesigns are fading, the radiation at your location is killing you. You need to cut all power to the weather control grid so we can obtain a transporter lock. We will repeat every minute until we get your response.<br />
>Commander Bachar's voice comes crackling out of the communicators<br />

**Captain Baras:** Baras to Lister, stand by on emergency transport, we're not ready to leave just yet<br />
>As the emitter shuts down, the bubble holding back the ionic storms flickers away, but the storm does not collapse in on the away team. Instead a path begins to form through the storm, in the direction of the Kelorian labs<br />

**Captain Baras:** I'll keep an eye on her, Viraseti, Murry, Zox, go with Skig<br />
*Zox really wanted to prattle off a bunch of starfleet rules and regulations justifiying such an act, but instead seems disortented and just mean.*<br />
**Skig:** Let's go figure this out.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti looks at Zox with a slightly annoyed look*<br />
*Skig walks in the wrong direction a couple times, then figures out she should be walking in the direction of the labs.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It might have been helpful if we had someone that could tell us where in their labs they are keeping the contained life forms<br />
**Zox:** You would trust someone that willingly _knew_ they were causing harm to a local lifeform?<br />
*Hailey Murry helps guide Skig along *<br />
**Skig:** Don't worry, we'll just run a scan with our tricoders to isolate ionic field conditions while triangulating their position.<br />

*Skig walks back in the room to see what the redecorating accomplished.*<br />

**Skig:** This system is quite complex, and I feel like some hydrocortizone and a steaming cup of coffee would be good.<br />
**Skig:** Or just a whole lot of painkillers.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'm just suggesting that "damper colleagues aggression" is sounding slightly ominous at the moment<br />
**Zox:** I have every faith in Skig.<br />
**Zox:** Surely Hailey has made these creatures understand we are here to help.<br />
**Skig:** Yes, that does somewhat imply that they will become impatient and rend us synapse from synapse in a brutal life ending fashion if we do not perform adequately. Kind of like mid-terms in Xenobiology taught by Admiral Forrest.<br />
