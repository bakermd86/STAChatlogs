>EXTERIOR - Fields outside of town: Ensign Ghex pops back out from the inside of the phaser emitter, and attaches a small chip to Throk's tricorder<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** That should do it I think, Throk has isolated the frequency that was used to perform the command injection, and I pulled the main isolinear input hub. So he should be able to track down where the signal came from, assuming it is within range of the tricorder. You know he is actually smarter than he looks, which is not necessarily saying a whole lot because he looks like a mindless killing machine. But I guess you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. I was actually kind of wondering how he even ended up in Starfleet, I had no idea there were any Gorn in Starfleet.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Throk did most of the work actually, I just went in to get the input hub because he is too big to fit. I am pretty small, and I don't mind tight spaces. When I was at the academy, we once had a power surge take out the sensors on a shuttle craft and I had to crawl in to the forward maintenance compartment to fix it, then the hatch jammed and I got stuck in there for 16 hours until we made it back to starbase. They had to cut through the front of the shuttle's hull to get me out.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk has been told Starfleet officer sent to Gorn space did not have appropriate carnivorous style teeth and did not bring enough barbecue sauce, so he did not make it through morning breakfast routine and was returned to Starfleet with traditional roll of toilet paper and black sealed trash bag.<br />
