>INTERIOR - Taganite Freighter: Lt. Malat fires a phaser blast past the away team, barely missing Skig's head. The errant phaser beam penetrates the main EPS conduit, near the fusion reactors. Main power cuts out and the ship is plunged into darkness, illuminated only by the glow of the emergency lights.<br />

*Skig sighs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I just fixed that.<br />
*Skig sets phaser to "Cause Cardassian to Halucinate Being Chased by Hordes of Rainbow Colored Butterflies through a field of Sunflowers."*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Don't kill her<br />
*Skig checks phaser setting again.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Also, we need to figure out what the hell is going on here<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** After we find Malat<br />
**Kurij:** It's some form of paranoia, I think. We need to figure out what vector it's acting through<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I agree, we need to get to the root of the biological problems caused by whatever radiation is being emitted by the debris from the Federation vessel.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think we need to figure out more what they wanted to sell, that tells you everything you need to know.<br />
*Skig is impressed that Ishemok can sound exactly like Zox, and remembers that in case it becomes important for shipwide announcements.*<br />
**Kurij:** Radiation would make sense. Can we run a scan on that? <br />
**Ishemok:** Rule 208: Sometimes the only thing more dangerous than a question is an answer. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Certainly. Of course, main power has been taken offline, so we should probably do that from the Lister, assuming someone has not broken the sensors in my absence.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We're not beaming back to the Lister without Malat<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Kurij, take point<br />
**Kurij:** Yes, Commander! <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However, our commanding officer has given us directions, so we should follow them.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Skig... stay where I can... nevermind<br />

**Ishemok:** Rule 62: The riskier the road, the greater the profit. <br />
*Skig readies phaser and activates tricoder to track for Cardassian lifeforms. Activates Aliens-Style-Motion-Tracker configuration for Tricoder.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Your road is going to lead straight into the brig and a pair of my boots up your ass if you don't put that back<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I am still going to put you in for a discommendation when we get back to the Lister<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But I will refrain from stunning you in light of your compliance<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Now, let's try not to commit any more crimes and go round up the other little criminal in our senior staff<br />

>Kurij picks up both a starfleet communicator signal approximately 50 meters east of her position, but also a faint Cardassian life sign heading north<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I shall retrieve the communicator and catch up with the rest.<br />
**Kurij:** We've got her communicator to the east here, but Malat's fled to the north. She's still on her game enough to try and throw us off her trail<br />
*Skig heads over to pick up the communicator to avoid getting mixed signals for future testing.*<br />
*Ishemok obediently follows Kurij*<br />

**Ishemok:** No Kurij, it's a trap!<br />
*Skig is disappointed by the fish-looking individual not saying "Tarp" in that line.*<br />
>Ishemok pushes Kurij out of the way of the tricorder trip wire just as it trips and overloads the backup EPS panel and a massive spark of electrical current hits Ishemok<br />

**Kurij:** Ishemok noooo!<br />
*Skig notes down, "Malat is not allowed near EPS panels" again.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar Ishemok falls to the ground, smoking*<br />
>Ishemok falls to the ground, smoking<br />

*Cmdr Bachar pulls Ishemok back to his feet and slaps him*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** No one is dying on this away mission, that's an order<br />
**Ishemok:** Rule 420: Never negotiate while smoking.<br />
**Ishemok:** This whole ship freightens me<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Kurij, is she close by?<br />
**Kurij:** She's about 50 meters north, through the doorway up there<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Commander, when we get close, I can trigger a temporary overload of the lighting in that room to create a blinding effect, similar to a flashbang. I am willing to try this on your command.<br />
*Ishemok thinks that being injured is the best thing ever, and that starfleet are a bunch of suckers for free medical care.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** If you pull that off Commander, I will stop putting negative marks in your performance reviews<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Ok, Skig get your surprise ready. Kurij, Ishemok, phasers on stun<br />
*Cmdr Bachar pulls out her phaser*<br />
*Skig is not going to mention she has hacked Commander Bachar's terminal, so everything she puts on Skig's report actually shows up on Murry's record.*<br />
*Kurij double check to make sure her phaser is on stun*<br />
*Ishemok sets phaser to STUN.*<br />
**Kurij:** Hey, Malat, are you feeling okay? <br />
**Kurij:** You seem slightly more hostile than usual<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we're going to die here, we're taking you with us!<br />
*Skig deftly (somehow while still in an EVA suit) rewires the crossfeed of the electrical lighting modulation system to create an immediate burst of light like a giant strobe light on an old 1890s style camera. And politely warns her crewmates to close their eyes in advance so she doesn't stun them also.*<br />
**Kurij:** What? What do you mean "we"?<br />
*Kurij closes her eyes and covers them for the flare*<br />

**Ishemok:  [6d6 = 19]**<br />
>Kurij goes to fire her phaser, but her grip slips and she fires directly down into the catwalk. As she fumbles with it, she accidentally ramps up the power setting and cuts a massive hole in the catwalk, causing the away team to fall through to the hold below<br />

>As they are falling, Ishemok shoots Commander Bachar in the back, but fortunately his phaser was at a very lower power setting.<br />

**Skig:  [3d6 = 16]**<br />
**Kurij:  [3d6 = 13]**<br />
**Ishemok:  [3d6 = 12]**<br />
*Skig smashes into the ground with a grunt.*<br />
*Skig is really impressed that Bachar can fall, get shot in the back, and still manages to shoot Malat right in the head.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar perfectly strikes Malat in center mass with her phaser while falling through the air and being shot in the back by Ishemok*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Commander, if we give you two phasers, can you also somersault through the air and fire with perfect accuracy?<br />
**Kurij:** Nice shot, Commander! <br />
**Kurij:** Wait, where did we land?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In a holodeck.<br />
>As the away team hit the ground and open their eyes, they find themselves hitting the hillside of a desert cliff, and they begin to roll down the cliff face into the canyon below<br />

**Ishemok:** Who in the right mind would want to be here?<br />

**Ishemok:** Aaaaagh! No rocks!<br />
>Kurij attempts to surf down the hillside on a large, flat rock, but misjudges her landing and instead surfs down the hill on her face, while loosing grip of her phaser, tricorder and communicator<br />

**Kurij:** Ow<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I doubt we are in our right mind.<br />
*Skig endeavors to land in a way that allows her to slide on her back using the EVA suit like a giant innertube going to a hill.*<br />

**Ishemok:** I don't know!<br />
**Kurij:** Commander, I think I just saw a...large bird dive down too? About the size of an albatross, 10ft wingspan<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Is everyone OK?<br />
**Kurij:** I'm fine<br />
*Cmdr Bachar looks around*<br />
**Kurij:** A bit stressed out, though<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** You're hallucinating giant birds, I am concerned about how hard you hit your head<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** As it is highly unlikely that we transported somewhere, I would guess the hold of a Taganite freighter that is either behaving like a Holodeck, or we are suffering from a mass hallucination.<br />
**Kurij:** I think we're all hallucinating a desert<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would prefer a parfait.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Writer gasps in horror and the thought that Skig made a joke.</font><br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I would prefer to get Malat and get back to the Lister<br />

*Cmdr Bachar turns into Tarqelian Albatross and scoops Ishemok up out of the water in her talons, depositing him onto the top of the cliff, out of danger*<br />
*Skig finds herself in complete agreement with Bachar for once, so clearly they are both suffering from some sort of altered mental state.*<br />
