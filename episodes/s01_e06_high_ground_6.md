![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Kurij only has one, and I'm pretty sure his species has two<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It better not have been caught in those secondary door relays on that shuttle, those are expensive.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Zox! Stop disarming our crew!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But good job saving them<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But im trained in non-violent de-escalation!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Disarming is an important part of that.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's not my fault your species can't regrow limbs<br />
>MEANWHILE In the other shuttle: The explosion rocks the second shuttle, knocking out main power, propulsion, and numerous other systems. The shuttle begins to tumble out of control away from the Lister and towards the event horizon of the black hole<br />

**Throk:** Throk know that for all things, there is a season.<br />
**Throk:** Sometimes, shows not renewed after one season.<br />
**Throk:** Sometimes, actor contracts also not renewed.<br />
**Ishemok:** Rule 123: You can't sell action figures if your person is torn apart and removed from the observable universe.<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect using phasers to overpower capacitor system will allow to use of communications system to ask for help and use our comm badges to determine triangulation of our existence for purposes of transport.<br />
**Ishemok:** OOh! Let's do that!<br />
**Throk:** Throk also suspect white cabbage taste better than green cabbage, so not all Throk ideas good. Also, do not stand downwind of white cabbage days.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Murry to Bridge, we appear to be out of power and engines. We're starting to drift back toward the black hole. Can you triangulate our positions? <br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest firing stabilization thrusters using all available power before we lose gravity and find situation gravitic.<br />
*Throk hands Ishemok Chinese Finger-cuffs.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk pickpocket this off Jem'Hadar, suspect may make fortune selling these in next life.<br />

**Ishemok:** I'd recognize that modulation anywhere<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Good, because otherwise i'd make you watch the training video again!<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Throk, I can't move very well. You're going to have to do this<br />
**Throk:** Throk not interested in interspecies relationship with psychotic woman at this time.<br />
>Ishemok however, is driven into a console face first. He suffers a near-fatal skull fracture, a lacerated eye socket, two broken arms, and a broken leg, along with numerous internal injuries. Ishemok falls on the deck in a pool of green blood, in desparate need of Dr. Zerra's immediate care<br />

**Throk:** Oh wait, Throk suspect you meant something else. Nevermind.<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Why do we have so many life-threatening injuries on this ship?<br />
**Throk:** Throk helping!<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect entire command crew need refresher course on preservation of crew. Except Skig. Skig cannot learn this no matter how much training effort expended.<br />
**Oakadan:** To be fair, I think all of these came from off the ship<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Did you get my ship parts??<br />
**Throk:** Throk feel point is made.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think he cannot handle the peril.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Bridge to sickbay, you'd all better get back up to the briefing room. We have another situation.<br />

**Throk:** Throk excited he not part of command crew and goes to find red cabbage to eat.<br />
*Zox seems interested in exotic cabbages.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** When the Jem'Hadar fighter exploded, the pressure wave against our shields pushed us back a few thousand kilometers in the soup. I was able to stablize the Lister with maneuvering thrusters, but it pushed us far enough that the Crazy Horse and the second Jem'Hadar fighter are back outside of our warp bubble<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And we still have no impulse engines to get back to them<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Suggestions?<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What do you plan to do with it?<br />
**Mowus:** I will go, only if a successful mission results in the shuttle being re-named old faithful.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, time for my next truly horrible idea.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ooh, exciting. Don't keep us waiting<br />
*Hailey Murry downs the rest of her coffee*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** During Operation Whalesong, the USS Farragut was able to generate forward thrust using a gravitic pulse "sail" generated by mylar fibroids reconstituted through the replicators in order to pull themselves out of a gravitic well and closer to the nearest source of light.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This was after their warp core and impulse was knocked off line by the alien probe which shorted out the entire EPS system beyond repair.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The accretion disk is far too dense with material for a solar sail to work, but actually it isn't crazy to try to harness the angular momentum of the material in the accretion disk itself<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Your sail would have to be orders of magnitude stronger than a mylar solar sail though<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It would be encountering violent pressure differentials and high velocity shear between layers of the accreted material<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Viraseti, your idea of "isn't crazy" and mine are very different<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So...you are saying, we are going to wrestle with a black hole and use it's own weight against it?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Metal<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Sounds like a good way to tear the ship into pieces and kill ourselves<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Precisely Zox.<br />
*Zox reaches for his Lucador mask.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** How would we control the Lister if we do this? The accretion disk is falling into the black hole isn't it?<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** You Federations fear death too much<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We really only have two directions we can go right now; in or out<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well Bachar, my three other options involve (a) disabling the inertial dampeners on the torpedo tubes, spinning the Lister around, and using shudder effect to push it. I predict a 5% change of success. (b) Recalibrating photon torpedoes into boarding launchers and sending people to the Crazy Horse by using burrowing torpedoes. (c) Rigging a warp generator to Old Faithless and trying to punt it to the Crazy Horse.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm an engineer, not a scientist.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Option B sounds fun<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But anyone who goes to the Crazy Horse would just fall into their timeframe<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think we have enough torpedos, and we'd exit the warp bubble if we tried it<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It doesn't make any sense<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'd have to torpedo the warp engine with it<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Option B was actually suggested to me on a post-it note, it looks like Zox's handwriting, to be honest.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I didn't say it was a good plan, I said it sounded fun<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, I for one don't think we should abandon the Lister<br />

>Mowus reaches for First Taran K'lor's Ketracel White tube, and the ever-alert First yeets him through the door and out of the briefing room<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Don't use the words 'abandon the lister' around Skig. Or do, but at your own peril.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I think sending a shuttle with a rigged warp field generator sounds safer than this accretion sail<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We'd need to send our best diplomat and our best pilot.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No reason we cannot try both, we will have time after the shuttle is off.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Good thinking<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Agreed<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Let's send someone on the shuttle and then work on the sail after they die. I mean, while we wait for their return<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thanks for the vote of confidence, Captain<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Benzite humor<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** You should visit our comedy clubs<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Captain, that is unnecessarily fatalistic, it has been shown today that most of the injuries sustained are fatal in less than 85% of situations.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Let's get to work. Viraseti, help Skig with the warp field generator<br />
*Skig is not sure what "acceptable losses of crew" translates to, she slept through class.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Zox, get started on the sail. It needs to be built Voth tough<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Sure thing!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Dismissed<br />
**Mowus:** But....Who will crew the shuttle?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I wasn't planning to live forever anyways<br />
*Lt. Malat heads down the shuttle bay to prep Old Faithless*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's good, your species is not known for immortality.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** All right Viraseti, so Old Faithless is a bit peculiar of a shuttle craft. It was originally built as a prototype during a summer project by Chief Montgomery Scott and I inherited it after Starfleet's Museum was going to mothball it from the Exhibit of "How Not to Do Things" after their Jury-Rigging class was cancelled by demand of the Admiralty.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Right, so does it have a warp core? Or life support?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So, there are a few quirks you need to know. First, you have to press the second side panel on the right with your left thumb while holding down that elevated pressure plate with your right foot or main power does not come online.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...that reminds me, I should probably put a new windshield on this.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I think life support is not really a "thing" here.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wonderful<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Look at it this way, you won't have to worry about losing life support, just make sure your EVA is fully charged.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It has a warp core, we might need to prime it. That's the Hand Crank over there.<br />

**T'Kor:** Good afternoon, Chief Engineer, how can I help you? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hello T'kor, we need to get the warp core to generate a pulse algorithm with the same sitgnature ats the Lister in order to avoid time dilation.<br />
*Skig flips open the "main computer console" and reveals a thirty bar abacus.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Preferably for long enough for the Crazy Horse to rescue the Lister<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** While I'm working on this, I need you to prime the hydrosympathetic pulse regulator to not spray slightly acidic water into the cabin whenever anyone screams, "We're all going to die".<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, what Viraseti said is a good idea T'kor.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Let me just record a quick goodbye message to my family before we leave<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Oh that reminds, I forgot to call my parents for the last 15 years <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I should call them sometime before they die<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Reroute all the power from the disruptors to the shield array. In fact, I don't quite remember why I fitted this Shuttlecraft with Disruptors, probably had spares at some point.<br />

*T'Kor helpfully wipes the outside of her helmet*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Are they puking in my shuttle?<br />
>T'Kor cannot answer as he jettisoned the entire comm system<br />

**T'Kor:** No, Chief Engineer. The EVA suits guarantee that it's sequestered.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good. I knew there was a reason I didn't re-install the window.<br />
*Throk not comfortable with Skig breaking fourth wall like that. Fourth wall breaking specifically Kolea's jurisdction.*<br />
>Malat maneuvers the shuttle into the aft shuttle bay of the Crazy Horse, when she goes to activate the landing thrusters the shuttle loses power and drops 2 meters onto the deck with a loud clang<br />

**Mowus:** We made it! So now what? <br />
**Mowus:** Tell them to merge our warp bubble nests and raft to safety?<br />
**T'Kor:** Now we have to unload some of the waste, hopefully the Crazy Horse is up to date on their biohazard disposal<br />
**Captain Dupont:** What is this heap of junk and where did it come from<br />
**Captain Dupont:** One second we were towing the Lister, then next thing we know that Jem'Hadar ship is gone, and this thing appears<br />
**Throk:** Throk certain that is dead-man-walking, but Skig not here to hear that. Of course, Throk not here either.<br />
**Captain Dupont:** You folks care to explain?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Make it quick, I'm not sure how long this warp bubble will hold out<br />
**Captain Dupont:** One second we see a Jem'Hadar fighter towing a federation ship, you send us some coded message about the war being over, and then the Jem'Hadar fighter explodes and this thing appears<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pulls her vomit soaked helmet off to reveal an equally vomit soaked head*<br />
**T'Kor:** The Jem'Hadar ship blew up and pushed the Lister back out of range. We'll want to begin making adjustments to your warp engines to create a warp bubble within the black hole's gravity well so we don't get time dilated<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Time is of the essence, I'll wash this off later<br />
**T'Kor:** Also, greetings, I am Lt Jg T'Kor of the Lister, Chief of Shuttle Engineers<br />
**Captain Dupont:** What the hell are you people talking about?<br />
**T'Kor:** You may not have noticed, but you fell within a black hole's gravity well a couple decades ago<br />
**Throk:  [d6 = 1]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why'd you roll that die, Throk?<br />
**Mowus:** We are from the future, you have been falling into this hole for many years. Our ship, the Lister, picked up a diallated signal and came to help!<br />
**Throk:** Throk not sure, Throk only know he is small pawn in large Star Trek universe.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Shut up fish man, no time to explain fully. Viraseti needs to get to engineering and needs your full cooperation or we'll be stuck here until everyone you know is dead. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Now lets move<br />
**Mowus:** But but...<br />
**T'Kor:** Would you like me to remain here and maintain our temporary warp field? <br />
>INTERIOR - Engineering: Malat frog marches her superior officers Viraseti and Dupont to engineering so they can save the day<br />

**T'Kor: [ CONTROL  (11) +  ENGINEERING  (4)]
[Focus: Repair/Tinkering ]
[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]
Success with 3 momentum [3d20 = 18]**<br />
*Skig is jealous and wants Repair/Tinkering as a Focus.*<br />
*T'Kor skitters around fluidly, replacing a tube before it can blow and reapplying lubricant*<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti starts punching a long string of differential equations into the warp field control computer in the Crazy Horse*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Let's hope this works<br />
>Viraseti expertly configures the warp field on the Crazy Horse to create a stable bubble, having now done this three times she's getting to be an old hand at it.<br />

**Mowus:** Stable Bubble. Doesn't seem right.<br />
>With the warp bubble in place, the Crazy Horse is able to tow the Lister out of the gravity well and the remaining Jem'Hadar fighter is able to fly out under its own power<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, looks like we are being saved. I guess Ill never get to wrestle a black hole....<br />
>INTERIOR - Mess Hall: As the Crazy Horse tows the Lister back to the nearest Starbase for its second major repair in as many months, the senior staff nurse their wounds and have some drinks to unwind<br />

*Skig runs over and hugs Old Faithless when it is returned to the Lister.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I missed you! You are wonderful and you saved everyone.<br />
**T'Kor:** Unfortunately, it was not without cost<br />
**T'Kor:** The communication array was lost in the process<br />
**Throk:** That's okay, it was actually a plasterboard cutout.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's okay, it was actually a plasterboard cutout.<br />
**Mowus:** Wait WHAT?<br />
>Skig and Zox attempt to rematerialize Ishemok from the transporter buffer, but with all the damage his transporter pattern diffused into the computer core. The Twins are able to salvage Ishemok's neural patterns and store in in the auxiliary computer core<br />

**Mowus:** why would let a shuttle launch without communications!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm surprised it launched, to be honest.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We will keep an eye on his neural patterns and make sure they are not lost<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The life support system for it is actually the main capacitor for the hydroponics lab and the reason it shoots fire is because all the EPS conduits are unshielded.<br />
**T'Kor:** It's quite a comfort, really<br />
**Mowus:** Can you at least put a sign on it that says, do not eat before riding?<br />
>As the staff are discussing the sorry state of Skig's inexplicably favorite shuttlecraft, First Taran K'lor comes into the mess, drawing uneasy looks from most of the crew present<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I got the idea for using the disrupters as maneuvering thrusters while winning a drinking contest with some Klingon engineers.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It actually kind of worked<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hail First Taran K'lor<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** although you have to be careful not to disintigrate anyone to your left or right when maneuvering<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Greetings lizard creature<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** I have confirmed with the Dominion ambasador on Deep Space 9 that the war is indeed over<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** So I am dissapointed I will not be able to kill any of you<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I was actually wondering if it could be used for close assault support during orbital insertions but vaporising defensive forces through maneuvering.<br />
**Throk:** Throk feel Jem'Hadar man not going to have to wait long, only matter of time before we kill selves.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** This one looks frail and weak, but these two look like a challenge<br />
*First Taran K'lor points at Murry, then Throk and Zox, as he speaks*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Now that we are not enemies, tell me: were you lying about the fate of my third attack craft?<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest not underestiimate small hairless one, she saw Jem'Hadar heads off with cooking utensils and use heads as puppets, calls it therapy.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** You claimed that you saw only 2, and did not destroy it, but was that merely a lie to pacify me?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We do not lie.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not at all, we're not exactly sure what happened to it. However, we were initially responding to a strange warp signature. I think someone may have pulled your third ship out of the gravity well before we arrived. <br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Who would do that?<br />
*Throk mimics Murry using a Jem'Hadar's stuffed head to speak.*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Why rescue one ship and leave 3 others behind?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possible they were knocked into the event horizon<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possible they never quite fell in<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Perhaps<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Im sure you can find out more when you reach a Dominion Base.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why, indeed...<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps the ship that was "rescued" was captured for experimentation by superior alien species interested in determining combat techniques of ferocious and honorable Jem'Hadar, surely they are strongest threat predatory invaders would face?<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** That seems... fanciful<br />
**Throk:** Throk have brochure.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** We may not be enemies any longer, but would you consent to a "training" battle, lizard man?<br />
*Throk makes popcorn.*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** I am dissapointed to have missed the chance to face you in battle<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure it was by a superior alien species, but the warp signature we got is one that's not typically active in these areas<br />
*Zox gets up out of his chair and stands tall and puffed up!*<br />
*Skig tosses Zox a Luchador mask.*<br />
*First Taran K'lor flips the table (with everyone's drinks on it) out of the way and adopts a fighting stance*<br />
**Throk:** Throk not betting person, but thinks this good opportunity for Murry to fleece crewmates.<br />

**First Taran K'lor:** Most pleasing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Verily, you have earned the title of First<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Perhaps if the Federation had more of your kind they would be a true threat to the Dominion<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Until we meet again lizard man. <br />
*First Taran K'lor salutes Zox and leaves*<br />
