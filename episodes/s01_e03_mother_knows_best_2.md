>Zox - Log Entry Stardate 61132.2: In an attempt to confirm Tumarara's assurances, having been throughly bamboozled in many star systems by miners, entreprenuers, and assorted con-artists, our away team ventured into an un marked auxiliary shaft in the mine. It is clear that Tumarara's species does not possess extraordinary senses of smell, because the places was infested.</font><br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Captain Baras has assembled the senior staff to discuss the Malari petition for membership, and the unfortunate incident which befel Commander Zox's away team through no fault of his own<br />

<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): I now occupy medbay 5 with a strange genetic malady of unknown etiology.</font><br />
**Captain Baras:** I have to file my report with Starfleet Command about the Malari petition for membership en-route to Zox's Mother's colony<br />
**Captain Baras:** I'd like everyone's input on the petition: Do we see any reason to recommend rejecting it?<br />

**Skig:** Mining Location A347.17 showed an excessive amount of dust on all their flame suppression units, indicating an absence of proper testing of the failover and suppression systems. Also, their women's restroom had an expired air freshener. However, I believe those are not exclusionary from Federation Membership.<br />

**Captain Baras:** Ummm.. Yes, I agree. I don't think we would be within protocol to reject their petition on those grounds<br />
**Zox:** I feel we should only approve if they are able to prove they take care of their workers' health; I feel as if they'd need better COBRA coverage.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Yo Joe!</font><br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Red lasers to victory!</font><br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I am not sure I fully understand what Zox is saying, but their medical database is very sparse. They don't have any record of treatments for this genetic damage that those snake-creatures cause<br />
**Zox:** That's sort of a problem if they intend to continue to work down there.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** I don't see why we are even considering their petition, they are barely even warp capable<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** From what I can find in the records, it looks like that was about what was expected. No sign of any sabotage with the ventillation nor sending those worm-things at us. So I have no objections. <br />
**Skig:** COBRA is only used during severance, and the snakes do not sever limbs, I think they need to show proper STGD coverage. Which is Short-Term Genetic Dismemberment, available from the Ferengi Bureau of Employee Transactional Coverage.<br />
**Zox:** Well shucks, they think of everything.<br />

**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We see no basis to object, their computer systems are all within Federation standards<br />
**Captain Baras:** In that case, barring any last-minute objections or addendums to the reports, I will prepare my report to starfleet.<br />
**Skig:** I agree with Malat, their propulsion and transwarp systems are very rudimentary. However, their proper handling of environmental systems and distant stellar location has likely curtailed development of more robust systems. Their computer and engineering standards are quite robust. Although I did manage to procure a number of these really awesome vaccum tubes from one of their scientists. I plan to add it to my music box.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Before we adjourn, Commander Zox, are there any cultural norms we should be aware of before welcoming your mother aboard?<br />
**Captain Baras:** The Federation database has almost nothing about Voth cultural norms or traditions<br />
**Zox:** I would caution wearing the color green.<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Plot twist: Zox's mother is red/green colorblind</font><br />
**Captain Baras:** Very well, dismissed<br />
*Captain Baras stands up and leaves the briefing room with Commander Bachar and the twins*<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): "Look at all these delicious slow moving trees on board, no wonder Zox loves all the free-roaming food sources."</font><br />
**Lt. Malat:** Speaking of Zox's mother, is anyone else preparing a list of questions?<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): "Good thing Keola is sick in MedBay for the rest of the episode, it would be bad for Zox's mother to ear the Orion nurse."</font><br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Umm... "eat" but with Keola... who knows?</font><br />
**Lt. Malat:** I hope she has baby pictures<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Oh, and most Voth have not been around distilled beverages; we find them far too tasty due to their similary to rotten, delicious foiliage. I would keep her away from ten forward.</font><br />
**Zox:** Oh, and most Voth have not been around distilled beverages; we find them far too tasty due to their similary to rotten, delicious foiliage. I would keep her away from ten forward.<br />
*Lt. Malat chuckles*<br />
**Skig:** I think baby pictures of Zox would be hilarious.<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Zox, are you on good terms with your mother? <br />
**Zox:** I must....go to sick bay.<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Well we will need a substantial number of her stem cells for the retroviral therapy to be effective<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** What's wrong commander?<br />
*Dr. Zerra turns to Zox at his mention of going to sickbay*<br />
**Zox:** I....feel a little lightheaded and weak. Like I want to sleep on a heat rock, but more than normal.<br />
*Dr. Zerra opens up his medkit and goes to scan Zox with his medical tricorder*<br />
**Zox:** I had no idea alien worm-snakes from beyond would have such an ability.<br />
**Skig:** The universe is full of strange and unusual wonders. Sometimes they are inimical to us.<br />
**Zox:** Stem cells should be an easy thing to get. <br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** You did mention that your mother did not want you to join. Do you think this is going to cause any unforeseen issues? <br />
**Zox:** If that's all you need to re-encode damaged areas.<br />
**Zox:** Probably not, but you never know. <br />
**Dr. Zerra:** This is... your lungs appear to be secreting something...<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks puzzled*<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Hailey Murry reacts to surprises with karate chops</font><br />
*Dr. Zerra Zox starts coughing and an eruption of gas begins to spew from his mouth*<br />
>Zox starts coughing and an eruption of gas begins to spew from his mouth<br />

**Skig:** I think that would depend on the level of damage to the DNA helices brought about by the infarcted triple nucleotide displacement.<br />

*Skig activates an emergency, non-permeable forcefield around Zox to prevent the gas from escaping and possibly infecting others.*<br />
*Skig blinks at the pile of Zerra, Murry, and Zox inside the forcefield.*<br />
**Skig:** Hailey, you were supposed to pull away, not towards.<br />

**Lt. Malat:** Where is Murry?<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Is she still in there?<br />
**Skig:** Yes. Which means your anger training class at 1500 today is probably postponed. Shall I interest you in some fisticuffs to burn off aggression followed by drinking at the bar?<br />
*Hailey Murry gesticulates that it will not necessarily be postponed, because she does not like having things delayed and kicked out of schedule*<br />
**Skig:** Obviously after the current crisis situation is averted.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Maybe after we get her out of there, I don't want to end under investigation for another officer's death<br />

*Hailey Murry gasps for breath, leaning back against the wall*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Thank you, Skig<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Zox, are you OK in there?<br />
*Lt. Malat takes out her tricorder*<br />
**Lt. Malat:** The atmostphere in there reads as highly toxic, but your life signs are stable<br />
*Skig transports Murry into a containment field inside Med Bay that has been prepared to contain any possible contaminants or infection she might have acquired from Zox's new physiology.*<br />
**Zox:** Correct. Thanks to the genetic prosthesis i currently have, these gases do not present a threat to me in the slightest.<br />
**Zox:** However, I would also caution that these gasses must be vented for they carry an explosion risk<br />
*Dr. Zerra comes back from setting up the containment field for Skig and begins scanning Zox with his medical tricorder*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** That might be unwise Commander, I don't think your lungs can process Oxygen anymore<br />
*Skig is defending her ship from biological lifeforms gone berserk.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Your alveoli appear to be binding with the flourine in the gas<br />
**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
*Skig returns back to where Zox, Malat, and Zerra are.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** We need to get you to sickbay so I can run a full scan<br />
*Hailey Murry chills in her containment field, listening into the discussion via her comms*<br />
**Skig:** This could be an interesting adaptation that, if reversible, would be helpful for survival in some environments.<br />
**Skig:** We could try it on Hailey to see if it works on humans.<br />
**Zox:** Particularly those enivironments without fire.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I don't think the captain would approve of that Commander<br />
**Skig:** Yes, or risk of electirical explosion.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): (electrical)</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I'd rather not be the guinea pig for this, thank you. It seems like quite a bother for standard operations.<br />
**Skig:** Well, obviously we would need Hailey's approval, I am not suggesting we involuntarily use the ship's counselor as a lab rat for a science experiment.<br />
**Zox:** Well this entire experience is leaving me rattled. <br />
**Lt. Malat:** We can't leave the chief of security in a containment field indefinitely.<br />
**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, can you arrange to have everything setup in Med Bay for Zox? I can transport him there in the same manner as Hailey.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** We need some way to stop him spewing explosive, toxic gas out of his mouth<br />
**Zox:** Can you engineer me a rebreathing apparatus, Skig?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We might want a full-body containment suit, just in case<br />
**Skig:** Certainly, but if Dr. Zerra agrees, I think moving you to a containment field in Med Bay first might be the best option.<br />
**Zox:** Very well.<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Also, the idea of Zox's suit inflating like a balloon is pretty amusing</font><br />
**Dr. Zerra:** It would be easier to examine him if we can stop him belching this stuff<br />
*Zox stews in his own toxic breath.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** If you can put something together, it wouldn't hurt<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): I like Balloon-Zox, we need to add that to the Marketable Action Figures(tm) for this season.</font><br />

>Skig beams Zox to Sickbay but due to a failure to clear the targetting buffer, she also accidentally beamed Murry from her containment field to another containment field. From Murry's perspective, she dematerialized and rematerialized a few feet away from Zox.<br />

*Skig is working on ideas while walking into the tooling workshop on her way from Transporter Room 3, oblivious to anything caused by her inattention to detail. Which happens when SQUIRREL!!!  OMG!*<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Ok, Commander Zox, your genetic damage is getting worse. I will notify the captain to increase our speed to your mother's colony before it gets any worse<br />
*Dr. Zerra turns to Commander Murry. *<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Commander Murry I have some good new and some... odd news<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Maybe someone should suggest putting Zox into stasis?</font><br />
**Dr. Zerra:** The good news is that you don't seem to have any genetic damage <br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Excellent!<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Skig would if she was there.</font><br />
**Dr. Zerra:** The bad news is... well it's probably easier if I show you<br />
*Dr. Zerra pulls up a scan of a clutch of eggs in Commander Murry's abdomen*<br />
*Hailey Murry steps up to look through the field in horror*<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Mazel Tov!<br />
>Just then, Captain Baras enters Sickbay with an older Voth female<br />

**Captain Baras:** Dr. we were able to hail the colony and Zox's mother was able to rendevuouz with the ship on a shuttle<br />
**Captain Baras:** I thought it prudent to get her here as quickly as possible<br />

**Rhuk:** Captain Baras, Zox has always had a weak stomach, especially after too many tubers, so I do not see where there is a problem.....<br />
*Rhuk Looks at the containment field*<br />
**Rhuk:** ...What is going on!<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I'm afraid there was an encounter with an indigenous life form<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Commander Zox has suffered extensive genetic damage as a result of exposure to the venom of an alien snake<br />

<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Because that would 100% result absolutely no hilarity.</font><br />
*Rhuk Waves at Rhuk through the glass*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** With your consent, I think we can treat his genetic damage if we have a close enough genetic baseline to compare against<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I'd like to use your genetic material to synthesize a treatment<br />
**Rhuk:** So you are saying, some eggs would really be clutch?<br />
*Zox continues to lurk in a gaseous chamber.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Unfertilized gametes would be ideal<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** But even a blood sample would probably help<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** The starfleet medical database has extremely limited data on your species<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** There is... a further complication, but I will let Commander Murry explain that<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Dr. Zerra dives behind a lead shield...</font><br />
*Zox finds it odd that Starfleet has such limited data considering both our species come from Earth.*<br />
**Hailey Murry: Hailey Murry has used a point of Determination to add a natural one to the dice pool.**<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I think that complication needs to be looked into in a lot more detail before we go into it, since we need to research it first, but if it does have any bearing on this current case we'll provide the relevant details <br />

**Skig ***(speaking with Malat)*: So how long do you think Murry and Zox were dating before they decided to feather their nest?<br />

*Hailey Murry leans against the field, hands on it as she looks at Skig*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Skig, this is your doing<br />
**Captain Baras:** Explain? Did Skig set you two up?<br />
**Rhuk:** You must explain Zox what is going on. I do not know which is more absurd; thinking a flimsy human a worthy nest matriarch, or having genetic damage from worms.<br />
**Skig ***(speaking with Malat)*: No kidding, they definitely kept it under wraps. By the way, which popcorn setting did you use? This is a great butter salt mixture?<br />
**Zox:** It is only the latter of those two, really!<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It was via the transporters. It has to have been. Again, I'm not sure they're even viable with the transportation, and with the genetic situation Zox is in I'd really like to make sure they don't take any creative liberties<br />
*Rhuk Looks at Hailey Murry.*<br />
**Rhuk:** Transporterss?<br />
*Dr. Zerra raises an eyebrow at the suggestion the transporter is to blame, and runs another scan*<br />
**Rhuk:** Iss that what they are calling it now?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I didn't think to check the first time, I just assumed... But these eggs don't seem to contain any of the Counselor's DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** So perhaps there IS a technological explanation rather than a physical on<br />
**Skig:** That would make sense though, doesn't she need to lay those to get them properly fertilized?<br />
*Skig eats another handful of popcorn.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** You're asking me? I don't even know which sex of Voth make the eggs<br />
**Skig:** I don't remember humans generally being egg-laying though.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** That's because we aren't<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** This is highly unusual<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Certainly a first for me<br />
**Skig:** Oh, then why do you have unfertilized Voth eggs?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Oh no Commander, they are definitely fertilized<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Just not with the Counselor'd DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Just not with the Counselor's DNA<br />
**Zox:** Weren't you just saying we need gametes about 10 minutes ago? Can't we just transport them out and use them to cure this dreaded snake disease?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh no<br />
*Skig shudders at the implication of having Zox shove un-fertilized Voth eggs into warm gushy parts as part of some strange mating ritual.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I need to sit down<br />
**Rhuk:** Wait, then who?<br />

**Rhuk:** Tell me Dr. Zerra?<br />

*Skig looks at Malat.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** It matches Zox for sure. But it also contains markers of the genetic signature of those snake creatures<br />
**Zox:** Well that's a twist.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I wonder if this is what the genetic damage was attempting to do<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** This could be their form of procreation, fascinating<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh nooooo<br />
**Skig:** Zox, you are the mother of an entire new species that is a hybrid of Voth and snake-creature that gestates inside humanity.<br />
**Zox:** I...I am not sure the words to react that exist in either of our native languages Skig<br />
**Zox:** But this suit is great work<br />
**Skig:** Thanks, I am glad it is working for you.<br />
**Zox:** Dr. Zerra, if all you need is unfertilized eggs to repair Zox, that is an easy matter. <br />
**Rhuk:** Dr. Zerra, if all you need is unfertilized eggs to repair Zox, that is an easy matter. <br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, yes. Of course. I forgot about that<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Pardon?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I got a little distracted by the current situation<br />
*Dr. Zerra grabs a sample container and gives it to Rhuk*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** If you can give me a few eggs in here, I can use that to get started on the treatment for Zox<br />
**Zox:** Yes, simply run a holodeck program to simulate the right season and that should get you a set really quickly.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** For the counselor... I think I need to discuss the options with Zox and Murry alone<br />
**Skig:** I think in the future I might need to adjust the controls a little so they are easier for you to reach with your peculiar hands. I did not properly account for those in the design. My apologies for thinking somewhat humanoid mammalian in my thinking.<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** I think they need a little privacy to discuss their options<br />
**Rhuk:** One does not drag me across space to exclude me from conversations.<br />
**Skig:** Meanwhile, Malat, Kolea, and I will work on the baby shower plans!<br />
*Rhuk looks stoically at Dr. Zerra*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Ma'am, the Federation has robust patient privacy regulations. I think it would be best if we honored Zox and Murry's privacy in this case.<br />
**Rhuk:** Zox has nothing he wouldn't share with hhis brood.<br />
