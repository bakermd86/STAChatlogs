<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor** Is it possible that Zerra never left, and had prepared himself a secret place to hide on the ship?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Or that another member of the crew has simply been involved from the beginning <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Or we have others who came aboard at the same time, or what Viraseti said.<br />
*Kolea hands Bachar a note.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I think the safest thing to do is make a shipwide announcement that the VIP passenger we picked up had a medical emergency and died, then divert the ship to a starbase. At least it might trick them and keep the Admiral safe for now<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** That's pretty smart.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Or... We do the exact opposite. Put Janeway up in quarters, and wait for them to try to finish the job. Catch them in the act<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Or we have Geret look like Janeway and not risk the real one?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, not to speak above my station (so to speak). But isn't that, um, really dangerous? She is like... super old, and already injured and stuff...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Correct. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Not that I necessarily want to see Geret dead.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh, yeah nevermind. Good thinking Kolea<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So we'd have to use a dummy with her voice patterns and DNA.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Or holograms.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor** I believe we have some of the Twins old setup that we could repurpose<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** For sabateours, they are being very precise.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** They know who they are looking for and who they want dead.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah that is a good point, why try to just gas the Admiral? Much easier and less technologically complicated to just blow up the whole ship<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** If that device has been installed for a while, it would indicate whoever put it there expected this situation to arise.<br />

>INTERIOR - Delta Flyer: Zox and his away team speed off at high warp towards his home colony dressed to the nines in the finest of Voth fashion. There is a strange, continuous background noise that has been present since the Delta Flyer departed from the Lister<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** But in my third year at the academy, we did do non standard shuttle operations. We never flew anything like this shuttle though, they were just Runabouts with custom navigation or tactical packages on them. Personally, I thought that the Runabout handled worse than a standard type-9 shuttle craft. But most of the other students preferred it because it had better overall engine performance.<br />
*Zox Does not find Ghex annoying, due to evolving in a herd of hadrosaurs.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** This shuttle is definitely faster than a runabout though, they ahve a top speed of warp 5. That is probably good, because we want to get to your colony before anyone kills your mom or anything. <br />

I had to read the database entry, I had no idea that any Delta Quandrant species' had established colonies here in the alpha quadrant, let alone joined the Federation<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Also, make sure you all wear nice clothes and try to act like the educated, starfleet personel you all are.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Then again, I guess you aren't technically a Delta quadrant species since you did evolve on Earth, but the database says that most Voth don't believe that and they think that is a heresy or something.
