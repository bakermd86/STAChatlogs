>INTERIOR - Transporter Room 3: T'Kor is on his hands and knees and knees under the transporter pad, engrossed in his thourough diagnostic, when he feels the ship jump to warp. Throk does not seem to notice as he is busy tearing the panels off the conduit channels to give T'Kor clear access.<br />

**Gra'lan:** So tell me, can you weld with those fingers of yours? Sounds darn convenient<br />
**T'kor:** Hmmm, we appear to have jumped to warp, without recovering our crew. Gra'lan, can you take a look in the other teleport chambers to make sure? <br />
**T'kor:** This will make reporting back to Skig a little more difficult<br />

**Gra'lan:** No lifeform has beamed out, no.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Very little radiation. Makes me uneasy truth be told.<br />
*Throk neatly stacks the paneling from the walls into the middle of the room, revealing all of the wiring and internal circuitry of the Lister's transporter room.*<br />
*Throk chews on some Asbestos insulation that is marked, "Only Edible By Gorn"*<br />
**Throk:** This go very good with tribble syrup.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Does that enhance your gizzard performance against really spicy meals?<br />
**Throk:** Throk think so.<br />
**T'kor:** I want to look into this a bit more closely here, but I think we should figure out why we jumped to Warp again. <br />
**Throk:** Talky insect man who is my personal BBQ unit makes good point.<br />
>Lt. Malat bursts into the room, hair wet, still fiddling with her uniform collar<br />

*Throk looks at her strangely.*<br />
**T'kor:** Oh, excellent, Lt Malat<br />
**T'kor:** You look moist<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I was in the sonic shower when I felt the ship go to warp, did the away team beam back?<br />
**Throk:** Why are you moist in sonic shower?<br />
**Throk:** Sonic shower does not use water.<br />
*Throk sniffs.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Nope. We just marooned them no doubt. At least that what the sensors say.<br />
**Throk:** You smell of very nice perfume.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What? Yes it does, have you... never used the shower?<br />
**T'kor:** No they did not, which I suspect means something has happened upstairs. I think we must be wary of our commanding officers<br />
**Throk:** Throk room not have shower. Can Throk use yours?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** he captain relieved me 40 minutes before the end of my shift, I went to my quarters to shower and change<br />
**Throk:** Throk room have large tank for boiling think in hot pot.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No, requisition a shower for your quarters<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Why does Skig allow crew to be assigned to quarters without showers<br />
**Gra'lan:** Efficiency.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): Someday... Malat may realize what Throk meant...</font><br />
**T'kor:** I do not require a shower<br />
**Throk:** Talky BBQ unit make for great steam boil with shower!<br />
**T'kor:** The idea that you simply do not incorporate the minerals that gather on you into your being is a little unnerving, but less so than the fact that you constantly shed yourselves<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't know that I need details on how T'Kor cleans himself<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): This is the point where I mention that Throk has a HIGHER insight than Skig.... and it actually is in character for both of them.</font><br />
**Gra'lan:** I bet I know how...lava soap!<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect bad thingsâ„¢ happen. Throk wonder if now might be time where we mutiny ahd have to eat people to restore order.<br />
**Throk:** Throk write inspiring war poem.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Truly fascinating, so I take it you know how the crew got body-swapped if you're spending your time speculating about T'Kor's showers?<br />

**T'kor:** Yes, that's what I'm looking into now<br />
**Throk:** Does combustion and liver rhymbe?<br />
**T'kor:** Who are the commanding officers right now? <br />
**Gra'lan:** Um...We are still looking in to that; we can almost rule out a technical failure on our part. <br />
**T'kor:** Given who we're missing<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** The Captain<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Last I checked, he still outranks the rest of us<br />
**T'kor:** And under that?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well, The Twins are next in command after Skig and Zox<br />
**T'kor:** Hm<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So they are acting first officer now<br />
**Gra'lan:** Eep.<br />
**Throk:** Throk also point out, medical officer can take command if captain deemed unfit for ingestion.<br />
**T'kor:** I think more importantly, whoever has the captain's ear is in charge. We should work to separate them and return, or figure out why we jumped. <br />
**Throk:** I mean Command, must remember, not on Gorn ship.<br />
**Throk:** Figure out why we jumped is easy.<br />
**T'kor:** I would like to continue working on this in the meantime, would you three like to go investigate the Captain? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (Comms):** Lt. Malat, Ensign T'Kor, Ensign Throk, Ensign Ishemok. Please report to the briefing room.<br />

**T'kor:** We're on our way,  Commanders. <br />
**Throk:** As Zox is not here, Throk assume he must channel inner might Security Chef!<br />
**T'kor:** Gra'lan, can you continue investigating the teleporters? Here are the specs of what we found before, see what you can find. <br />
*Throk goes to replicator and gets a Phaser Type-1 and a large chef hat.*<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Thank you for joining us, Ensigns T'Kor, Ishemok and Crewman Throk I have asked to join us as they are... somehow... the highest ranking members of their respective departments aboard the ship now, with the away team gone<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I truly do not understand how Throk is on the crew manifest as "Assistant Counselor" but, Commander Bachar handled that usually<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Regardless, I called a briefing to explain our recent jump to warp.<br />
**Throk:** Throk honored to help crew with culinary and psychological issues through meditative ingestion.<br />
*Throk listens patiently.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Just a few minutes ago, I received a priority 1 emergency communique from Starfleet Command. I cannot share the details of the message, but we have been ordered to proceed without delay to Starbase 34.<br />

**Ishemok:** Why, it'd take a surprise Jem'Hadar attack on a helpless space station to warrant such erratic behavior!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Our orders were clear, we were to proceed without any delay<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I cannot give you any more detail than that.<br />
**T'kor:** How should we best prepare for our arrival?<br />
**Throk:** Starbase 34 is 5 days away at warp 5, if there was a surprise attack, we would be there to eat the survivors.<br />
**Throk:** Rescue... I meant... re-sauce.<br />
**Throk:** No, rescue.<br />
**Throk:** Throk be quiet now.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Mr. T'kor. I'd like you to stop the transporter investigation and re-assign engineering resources to run a full system diagnostic before we arrive. I'd like to ensure we're in top shape<br />
**T'kor:** Should we have weapons at the ready for re-entry?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Mr. Throk, the crew will no doubt be unsure of the situation given our orders, I think it is important that we have someone acting as counselor to assure them that this is nothing to be concerned about<br />
**Ishemok:** Um? boss? Sumthin 'about this just doesn't add up. Why would we want to get into a scuffle witout our Security Chef?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Mr. Ishemok, as acting science officer, I'd like you to run a full level-5 diagnostic on the long-range sensors. <br />

**T'kor:** With regards to the body swaps: what are your thoughts toward the teleporter situation?  <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Oh, well I suppose the most likely place you could have an issue would be in the pattern linker. It must have gotten their physical and neural patterns mismatched<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It's a pretty robust system though, certainly I've never heard of such an issue before<br />
**T'kor:** What will you be doing on our voyage? I noticed the captain didn't give you any specific orders. <br />
**T'kor:** Though perhaps those were provided before we arrived<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, I have to prepare sickbay for potential medical emergencies. We should be pretty busy I suppose<br />

**Throk:** Captain seem very decisive and in-charge, very authoritative and not in need of retirement through ingestion.<br />
**Throk:** Throk find this very suspicious.<br />
*Throk sniffs Malat.*<br />
**Throk:** You still smell nice.<br />
**T'kor:** This could be the result of the captain having strict orders<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Don't smell me<br />
**T'kor:** Or the result of the captain having used the transporter to switch minds with one of the Twins<br />
**Throk:** Can I pat on head? You are short.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or he could just be having a good day, sometimes it's like that with cognitive decline<br />
**Throk:** That curious T'Kor, can we check Transporter logs?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That's a... problematic thought<br />
**Throk:** Throk go to check Transporter Logs.<br />
*Throk leaves.*<br />
**T'kor:** We're going to have to investigate the usages of the teleporters here, sooner rather than later. There are logs for these things, both primary and secondary. <br />

**Throk:** Throk familiar with Transporter Logs, you knock down large tree, remove bark, send downriver as transport to where they can be processed. Throk see this on old holovids.<br />
**Ishemok:** Didn't they mark the trees to sort out who owns which? Would be awfully....convenient, if there was some way to do that with transporter signals.<br />
**Ishemok:** Is there some way to look at the actual physical signal rather than the computer records to find out what's been going on?<br />
**Ishemok:** I wish we had the real Science Officer here.<br />
*Throk returns chewing on a large piece of replicated bark.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I like your thinking, we can't really trust the computers if we suspect the twins<br />
**T'kor:** We can't trust the software, at least<br />

**Throk:** Throk happen to know that in sub-deck four, all logs are stored on ancient reel-to-reel tape running on 16-bit mainframe with vaccuum tubes. Skig left it installed from original Lister deployment. All logs auto stored there for period of 48 hours, then deposited into disposal unit and new ones get replicated.<br />
**Throk:** It is unlikely that binary based creatures capable of handling such archaic technology, if they even know it exists.<br />
**Throk:** Or maybe Throk hallucinate that while eating too many Tribbles.<br />
*Throk shrugs.*<br />
**Ishemok:** Quick, someone get Gra'lan to check the device!<br />

**Throk:** Skig not let Throk into secret punch card room after Throk discover punch cards taste like glue.<br />
*Throk gets out toothpick and chews pops out what looks like some human finger bones.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk find transporter logs also, but not from reel-to-reel tape system.<br />
*Throk hands over paper copies of printed transporter logs.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk also notice 14675 is missing.<br />
**Throk:** Throk not eat that one, by the way.<br />
**T'kor:** Open your mouth please<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't see how he could eat a computerized record<br />
*Throk distends lower jaw so he can swallow a redshirt whole.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But yeah, maybe you should get those tape backups instead, I don't want to have to fish them out of Throk's intestines<br />
**Throk:** Excellent idea, nice smelling short angry woman.<br />
**T'kor:** Also, I'd like to comment that Dr Zerra was acting very nervous. I suspect he may be blackmailed or otherwise guilty of something uncomfortable, but not necessarily related to this<br />
**Throk:** Dr Zerra could also just be injecting some sort of hyperstimulant into the Captain to make him more functional at the expense of killing him. Like Gorn Super soldiier drug that makes Gorn capable of throwing shuttlecraft but then their heart explodes.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think it taste like chocolate and put it as topping on food for entire squad before battle with Klingon army. Throk sent here as sign of appreciation by Gorn High Command.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well we can't do a mutiny based on some suspicious behavior, so we need to be 100% certain before we do anything that will get us all court martialed<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Murry, have you considered cutting back?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What is interesting is that the object's mass does not match its effect on the local stress energy tensor<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There is some missing rest energy that I cannot explain<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It starts to have a gravitation effect on the energy tensor just befopre it appears, and continues to have an effect just after it vanishes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And for some reason, the stress-energy tensor reading is always a bit more than it should be, given the mass<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I've never seen anything quite like it<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Does this include the stray globules that appear and disappear as an explanation of the missing mass?<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, we can try setting up a spectrum scanner to see if there is some sort of repeatable pattern on the theory *they* - if *they* are actually a creature and sentient, are trying to communicate with us.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We have encountered energy beings before, perhaps we can look for patterns.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Good thinking, see what you can put together<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But I will accept other ideas that might get a result faster.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Methinks they just want to balance between waves and particles. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So finding equilibrium in their existence, which is somehow thrown off by the singularity's existence?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do you suppose there might be a way to split them from the singularity if it is causing "interference" for lack of better terms?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Either that or they are shifted half into subspace which accounts for them losing more mass as they gain more energy....<br />

>It does seem to respond to the probing, and Viraseti is nodding along at the readings. Until suddenly, the ship lurches violently<br />

>The entity begins to oscillate, and rapidly change size and shape, as the ship is violently tossed about and the crew slam into the walls and consoles<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Very softly, very precisely, what can they react to...<br />

>Zox adjusts the probing parameters and the entity continues to thrash around, this time there is also a strange sound like finger-nails on a chalkboard.<br />

*Skig activates the magentic boots she is wearing.... and then realizes that is not the body she is currently inhabiting.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** These readings are incredible, whatever you're doing it's certainly getting a response. Keep at it Commander<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is fascinating...<br />
>As Zox continues probing the anomaly, a loud groaning is finally heard as the entire crew is again violently thrown to the floors, and the power flickers out.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I just fixed all those relays!<br />
>As they stand back up, Subcommander Tekal steps out from the bridge<br />

**Subcommander Tekal:** I do not know what you have done here, but it has had an unfortunate consequence it seems<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You can worry about that, we have reems and reems of data on this thing<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We are somewhere else in space, and some when else in time?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is going to take hours to analyze it<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Indeed, the navigational computer can no longer identify our location through a stellar nav fix<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Wherever we are, the stars are unknown<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Was this the same sort of incident that left you in Federation space? <br />
