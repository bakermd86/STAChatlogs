>Captains Log, Stardate 61857.6: It still feels strange to be recording these... We are still awaiting our next assignment at Starbase 34. Murry is heading up the investigation in the meantime. Our situation is currently.. complicated.

> Nurse Krepeka's body is in the brig, under the control of a crazed Vulcan bio-terrorist. Her mind is stuck in Dr. Zerra's body, who is still MIA. The Twins launched themselves towards Earth in a Type-8 probe, without permission or explanation. 

> I guess it would be too much to ask for to take it easy in my first week as a starship captain. Hopefully Murry and her team find a thread we can pull on, I don't want to spend any longer docked at the Starbase than necessary.<br />

>INTERIOR - Conference Room: Murry has converted one of the diplomatic conference rooms on Deck 4 into an investigation center. PADDs containing all the various documents and findings of the investigation are scattered about the table, and Malat has 2 security guards posted at the door to ensure the room remains secure. <br />

*Skig walks in covered in "Star Trek Engine Grease" and looking annoyed, muttering something about "What do they teach Chief Engineers these days".*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, what do we think of the Twins? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I can't believe they were in on it too.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** They know everything we know, we need to track them down<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** And break their tiny little knees<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure if they were<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Neraran didn't rely on them, and they seemed just as caught by the chemicals as the rest of us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Then again, she is nuts<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** They went AWOL in the middle of a crisis hidden in a probe, hardly innocent behavior<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is quite possible they believe there is an imminent threat to Starfleet and as they might not have had faith in the Lister being able to relay or deal with the situation decided to foresake the Lister in favor of warning Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Very much that.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Well I still way we track them down and rough them up a little<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Also, it's possible one of them might not agree on a course of action, but they exist as a team. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think they deserve some roughing up at least, they could've left a more comprehensive set of notes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have a nice blob of Breen in the Brig you are welcome to punch whenever you feel the urge Lt Commander Malat.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In any case, Ms Murry, what have you discovered that we can act on?<br />
**Windbloom Openheart:** Wow, why all the harsh words shipmates. No need to be so violent<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You have a lot of work ahead of you Windbloom.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, we've got a few things of note. T'kor reported that he found a device from the twins, and that he'd been monitoring their navigation-based comms<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I hate to be coldblooded, but violence has been a way of life here.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Neraran nuked Zerra's office. Were we able to recover anything from the wreckage?<br />
**Windbloom Openheart:** Violence is a poison man, you've got to detox your soul<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Well, Kolea put the fire out pretty quickly. But the only thing Neraran torched was a supply closet full of bacteria<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** I don't know that a bunch of petri dishes of bacteria are worth anything to begin with<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Geret may know more about this stuff. She was sneaking around pretty effectively.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** They would be amazingly useful to a bioweapons expert plotting to create all sorts of nefarious things to disable or kill a mixed crew like ours.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Whole thing seemed fairly...baroque? Why bother to engineer bacteria when there's replicators. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** At least, that's my guess from my "well-rounded cadet courses" in biology that I had to take.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we can have someone look into the resources that were put into Zerra's research, especially recently, that would be great. Any digital logs as well. I'm hoping we can reverse engineer this, because Zerra is stil lout there, and I do believe he was involved in a biological weapons scandal<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Probably because replicators cannot generate bioweapons, but you can grow them if you know what you are doing?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I mean, they do have safety protocols on them, at least, usually.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pokes her head through the door*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I hope I'm not interrupting<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not at all, come on in<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Something very odd happened this morning when I went to replicate my breakfast<br />
*Skig looks annoyed that engineering has another issue which has not been corrected.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There was a pattern lodged in the buffer, and it materialized this inside my breakfast<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh that's horrifying<br />
*Skig wonders if we should all don hazmat suits.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This seems like a security issue.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti places a glass of Mango Lassi on the table, inside the glass is a flip-up notepad with "Tell Zox what you told Zerra" written on it*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): "im okay with this"</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Huh<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I assume it must have been the Twins<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know who else could manually program such a precise replicator pattern directly into the output buffer<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Kolea really wants to know why someone wants Viraseti to have "pillow talk" with Zox and if this will make Murry jealous.</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Was this directed at you? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It must be, it was in the replicator in my quarters<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox and I can take a look at the replicator for other issues on a security/engineering standpoint. We can also pull the logs for the replicator to see how it was applied to the output buffer.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think we just replace the entire replicator set while we are here. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** How often to do you use it? And has your salad been more fibrous than normal?<br />
*Skig wonders how many copies of the note Viraseti ate before she noticed it.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I usually eat in the mess, this was the first thing I replicated in my quarters since we got back to Starbase<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We could upgrade her to one of those new RFG-9000s like we put in Throk's room. The one that can replicate a whole smoked targ.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have a few dozen in storage for some reason.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Adds to the olde timey feel, much like starship captains raising grapes, for some reason.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am not sure what the note is referring to, but if I had to guess it is probably about the warp signature. Which means that the Twins were spying on us when we... Those little perverts<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns red with some mix of anger and embarassment*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I think that is because they had to use a VPN to get around the age limitation on PornHub and routed it through Zerra's room.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, at the very least it sounds like the Twins weren't on the same page as Zerra and Neraran <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think one of them was<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And one of them wasn't<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** but it's impossible to defect against your twin.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Conceiveable, since they are a "re-forged pair" since they both lost their original matched Bynar.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Only way to find out is to track them down and break their legs<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We do not have to break their legs, Malat<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Save that for Zerra<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Is it safe to say that we've sent out a warning for someone bearing Neraran's description? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Or have we not done that yet?</font><br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know what it has to do with anything, but the only thing I can think that the note would be referring to would be the warp signature from the blackhole near the Sulani cluster<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ah, that anomaly? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Please elaborate<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, when we encountered the Jem'Hadar there, they gave us sensor records of a Starfleet warp signature they had detected absconding with one of their vessels just before we arrived<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The warp signature clearly looked like a Starfleet vessel, but it didn't match any current Starfleet ships<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I eventually found that while the primary signature looked like a Starfleet vessel, the secondary and tertiary harmonics didn't match<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did they match other patterns?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Meaning that the primary warp signature was a fake, broadcast over the real signature to disguise it<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I couldn't find a match, they won't have the halmark energy signature Starfleet warp signatures<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They could be Klingon, Cardassian, Breen... Just about any other fleet that uses laser-induced fusion injectors<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pulls out a PADD*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The red portion is the primary signature, which I believe is falsified. And the higher order harmonics appear to be legitimate<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know what this has to do with anything though<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This would definitely be a way to make someone think that a Star Fleet vessel has just warped into their area though, wouldn't it?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, anyone reading this warp signature would certainly believe it belonged to a Starfleet vessel<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not sure if this really helps<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It does; possible to filter out the trojan-warp signature?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We've got a ploy which is intending to make Star Fleet think they're being attacked, and another ploy intending to make someone think Star Fleet is attacking them<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Let me see that PADD. I want to use advanced Bayesian methods to take out anything that looks like a starfleet signature, then run that against our astronomicon.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is a large vessel, and one I do not think we have a detailed warp signature for.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did we get any other descriptions from the Jem'Hadar of the ship or their other vessel?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** No, due to the time dilation the vessel was only in sensor range for a fraction of a second from their perspective<br />

**Ishemok:** Thank you Virasetti. I will pass this info along to report any dubious warp signatures. This is excellent reasoning. <br />
**Ishemok:  [Total: 1] [Effects: 1] [dChallenge = 1]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do we have information about their other ship? I suspect it's going to be used for nefarious purposes as well<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** The Jem'Hadar ship? First Taran K'lor said he was going to try to locate it, but we haven't been keeping in touch with him<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Not sure if he had any luck<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'll reach out to him to see if we can get an update, or at least more information about which ship was taken<br />
*Captain Bachar strides into the room and stops near the head of the table*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** Repair crews are disembarking now, we are about to get underway. We are going to need a course<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** I was listening in over the comms, sounds like you have a few different leads.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** I say we track down the Twins and beat some answers out of them<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Or follow their signals and find their co-conspirators<br />
**Windbloom Openheart:** Or we do a drum circle and smoke some ganja<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Ishemok): Im out of the running; no hands here, only prehensile claws.</font><br />
**Ishemok:** Ganja!<br />
**Ishemok:** Oh wait, I only get high on electricity.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Windbloom, I wand violent urges on this ship to decrease by 30%; dispense peacebloom!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Twins are headed towards Earth, we should  realistically be able to have them followed. Tracking down their co-conspirators might help us get insights into their motives for people who are not expecting us.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Additionally, we might be lucky enough to head in the direction of a research facility that some co-conspirator of the Twins resides at that would get us access to a greater subset of warp signatures.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** At least, if we have an idea who their signals would allow us to track down.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can someone look up a Dr Tu'var? It looks like Zerra was working with them<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Zox has a point, but I do still want to track them down and have a not-very-pleasant chat<br />
**Windbloom Openheart:** You are too confrontational Roda, you need to learn to chill and let the universe come to you man<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I've got faith that they'll find their way into our presence again<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** Alright, well we still need a course to give Ghex up on the bridge<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Looking up one Dr. Tu'Var....<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** If this Dr. Tu'Var is a fake identity, it is at least real enough that these messages contain Starfleet medical cryptographic signatures<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** So someone at Starfleet Medical was sending these<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think if we can find Tu'Var, we can find Zerra and Neraran's body<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Someone with suitable cryptographic and espionage skills would probably be able to reverse engineer the chain of trust across the signature to find which authority server signed the egress message on the sending server, then check that against the PADD relays to get us a point of origin.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I refuse to believe someone at Starfeet medical would doctor messages!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes, great idea!<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Some manner of doctoring would be quite necessary.<br />
*Skig is still the fun police for Zox's puns.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Computing....<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** At least, that is what Kolea asked me to do the other day to find out who had been sending her salacious unsolicited messages about wanting certain body parts checked for injury. I told her I didn't think it was possible because it had never occured to me, and why the Chief Medical Officer would know that much about message tracking seemed odd.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I've got it down to one of three terminals, in the Virology department. Can't get any more specific than that.<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wait... that actually worked?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So we could pay starfleet medical a visit.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** While, you know, looking pretty vulnerable around Earth.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I was just giving you what I thought was a totally bogus idea that Kolea asked me to look into.<br />
*Skig is amazed.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well it's the best lead we have, I think?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We can also use the Starfleet reference database for warp signatures if we are headed there, and possibly track down the Twins.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** All roads lead to Earth?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** In that case, I'll order Ghex to set course for Earth<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** Skig, assemble two away teams to run down those leads<br />
*Zox puts on a fishing hat...for no reason.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** And in the meantime, I am heading to transporter room 1 to say goodbye to the captain. His granddaughter is taking him back to Benzine<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Captain Bachar:** If anyone wants to say goodbye before he leaves<br />
*Skig heads off to "assemble" robotic drones to act as Away Teams, as she is both literal and does not trust Lister people to follow orders.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Come on Peacebloom, let's head down to the holodeck and play Fishing Simulator 24K.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I feel like I'd probably cause more problems than are good for him<br />
*Captain Bachar heads to the transporter room with anyone who wants to join*<br />
*Skig heads down with Bachar to see Captain Baras off.*<br />
