![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** bubble bubble bubble<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Happy New Year everyone!<br />
**Throk:** We survived to new season?<br />
**Kolea:** Was there any doubt?<br />

>INTERIOR - Drug Lab Cargo Bay: Jasanis is lying on the ground, hogtied and knocked out when suddenly, Kolea's tricorder beeps out: "Pika, Pika"<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Still the same season, we just rolled over into the new year<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Evaucation Protocol! Doctor, whatâ€™s the fastest way out of here!<br />
**Kolea:** Not ovulating yet, so that must mean we are about to be attacked.<br />
>As the crew spin around to look for danger, multiple oozelings comes out of the vents and cracks in the floor, and congeal around Jasnis, causing her to double in size and sprout oozy gooey tentacles from her arms and hair<br />

**Throk:** Throk have answer to that, but think you asking rhetorical question.<br />
>[ROUND 1]<br />

**Kolea:** For the record, Orion women consider tentacle monsters a favoured enemy due to our long standing alliance with Hentai Protagonist Girlfriends.<br />
**Throk:** Throk not at all surprised by this.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No one is at this point.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So the good news is she's still unconscious, so it's not going to be acting on her behalf<br />
**Kolea:** The bad news is, why am I closest to it?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Technically Jasanis is closer<br />
>[TURN] Tentacle 1<br />

**Kolea:** Closest of the people whose existence I care about?<br />
>One of tentacles lashes out at Kolea and slaps her away, as the monstrosity begins to pull itself away from the away team <br />

**Kolea:** Hey, burly and physically imposing Nausican, I don't suppose you happen to have a communicator and access codes to allow us to beam up to Jasanis' ship?<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** Good thinking, this is why I always follow orders of Orion females<br />
**Kolea:** Dr Malov wants to encourage your colleagues on the ship to unite to further the cause of Nausican wellbeing.<br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zoxar): realizes that Kolea deserves commendation for being an expert at swapping.</font><br />
**Nausicaan Thug:** Much victory<br />
**Nausicaan Thug:** I call for security team to put them in brig<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, he is amazing with his prowess and easily captured us all.<br />
*Kolea nudges Dr Malov.*<br />
**Kolea ** *(whispers)*: Now is a good time to discuss the benefits of unionization.<br />
**Kolea:** Oh, we don't need a security team, we are completely docile and willing to walk there on our own.<br />
**Zoxar:  [2d20 = 18]**<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Gentlemen, before we go on to the brig: don't you wish you had a bigger gym on board? Bigger gym, bigger muscles I always say<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zoxar): Union has better dot-jom tables.</font><br />
**Dr. Malov:** With the benefits of a strong labor movement, and good union leadership, you will be in a position to demand better amenities from management. Recent studies have shown that unionized labor forces have more time in their week to spend in the gym, getting swole<br />
>The six men in the transporter room begin nodding their heads in unison <br />

**Nausicaan Thug:** Little blue man makes good sense, good words<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): We need to get Dr Malov on the Lister or come up with some plausible justification for him to show up regularly on the show, other than Kolea Booty Call.</font><br />
**Nausicaan Thug:** But if Jasanis says "no", we disintigrate you<br />
**Kolea:** Hey, did you fire all the photon torpedoes she asked you too?<br />
**Nausicaan Thug:** I work in transporter room<br />
**Kolea:** Right, we will need to stop by the bridge and check on the way to the brig. Thanks again.<br />

**Kolea:** Federation types are always full of fun!<br />
>MEANWHILE... INTERIOR - USS Lister, Main Engineering: Skig is suffering through the boredom of monitoring a stationary starship while neither Zox nor Murry are around to blast large holes in it at random. Mercifully for her, this period of quiet contemplation is brought to an end when the main engineering console erupts in warnings that the matter/antimatter injectors are surging and the warp core is minutes away from exploding.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Somehow this is definitely the fault of Zox or Murry.<br />
