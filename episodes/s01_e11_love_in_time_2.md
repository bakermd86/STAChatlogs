>INTERIOR - Orlana Conservation Research: As Skig and Viraseti look on, Oakadon and Dr. Gallego double over in pain, throwing up on the floor. Several other scientists around the room can also be seen suffering similar effects.<br />

*Skig looks at the coffee in her coffee cup.*<br />

**Gra'lan:** Hrm....<br />
*Skig tries to think of what Dr Zerra would do in this situation.*<br />
*Skig looks at Oakadan.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** On a scale of 1 to 10, where 10 is, "disintegrate me now" how much pain are you in?<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** At least an 8<br />
**Kolea:** I notice you didn't try to think of what I'd do in this situation?<br />
**Oakadan:** Maybe a four, definitely not a<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's because I *know* what you would do, and I don't think tearing off people's clothes is helpful.<br />
*Kolea pouts.*<br />
*Oakadan throws up onto the floor beside him*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Well, I'd say your environmental controls have gotten chewed too, either that or you are hiding a heavy chemical factory somewhere abouts?<br />
*Gra'lan points to some readings on a tricorder*<br />
**Gra'lan:** I don't suppse you are trying to create the right atmosphere to be a sancutary for the elusive, acid-breathing magmasaur?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The coffee is a bit off, tastes like what happens when you attach a plutonium flush filter from a Cardassian toilet system over the dispenser on a replicator.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... elevated levels of methane, sulfur, ethyl bromise... curious.<br />
*Skig pounds away at the controls on a replicator and begins mass producing rebreather units, handing them out to the unaffected first.*<br />
>As Skig starts handing out rebreathers, the away team and the rest of the people in the lounge start to feel better, but you can still hear the distant moans of people reacting badly to the new atmospheric mix<br />

**Gra'lan:** Perhaps we should check with environmentals?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Definitely, and trace when this started and see if it is a result of clearing the tribble-clog.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, is this mixture more or less toxic to them than other species here?<br />
*Oakadan takes a deep breath of actually clean air.*<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Well tribbles do metabolize bromine, which is fairly unique among mammal species<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** So they could be related, at least to the ethyl bromide<br />
**Oakadan:** This wouldn't have any notable effect on tribbles, then, would it?<br />

**Oakadan:** Wait. Oh no. These are... well, mature tribbles let out this combination of chemicals as a byproduct of their digestive process...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, that.<br />
**Oakadan:** How... oh no, how many tribbles are in here?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So we are experiencing the result of flatulence of millions of triibbles?<br />

*Gra'lan begins writing strange mathematical symbols on the walls in chalk, modeling the current and future tribble population based on gas abundance.*<br />
*Gra'lan scratches his head, coughs a bit due to gas.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** We've got a booooot....a million right now<br />
*Skig sends update to Captain Baras that the colony is currently inundated with massive amounts of tribble flatulence and the environmental system will need work to compensate for changes in their diet based on an excess of fatty foods and cladding.*<br />
*Yalak comes shuffling hurriedly around the corner wearing a large glass-domed environment suit*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Oh wait I didn't carry the...about 10 million<br />
*Skig is trying to imagine either Baras or Bachar reading that with a straight face, and failing.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** You could say tribbles make for some fuzzy math.<br />
**Yalak:** Oh no, this is really not good<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There is an abundance of Tribbles.<br />

>An older Betazed woman wearing a bright pink and orange dress with an elaborate coif of red hair chases Yalak down the corridor, seemingly unfazed by gas as she is wearing no breathing aparatus<br />

**Luatoria Dural:** Now you listen here you greasy little pig man, I have violinists throwin up all over the floor, and a percussion section that is curled up under their marimbas<br />
**Gra'lan:** Weelll sir. I suggest beaming everything edible off the continent and waiting a few days. No other way really.<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** This is unacceptable, we are a respectable orchestra. We will not tolerate these conditions<br />
*Yalak runs to Skig*<br />
**Yalak:** Um, help?<br />
*Yalak hides behind Skig from the wrath of the fancy Betazed woman*<br />
**Oakadan ** *(Quietly to Skig)*: The facility is not yet at a dangerous level of gas, but we need to look into this. Eventually, the concentration will turn this place into a pressurized bomb.<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** A BOMB!?!?<br />
**Gra'lan:** If only we had one'a those biologists around, and had a way to even more rapidly dimimish their food supply. Cause we arent' doing it with any other form of pest control, that's all a lot of gimmicks.<br />
*Skig looks at the Betazed woman.*<br />
*Luatoria Dural people around the room turn toward Luatoria and begin to look uncomfortable*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is an engineering problem caused by a surrfeit of excessive pressure brought about by unintended gas emissions.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There is nothing to worry about here ma'am. What is the problem you are experiencing?<br />
*Luatoria Dural points toward all the vomiting people around the room*<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** Is that not obvious?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan, Oakadan, can you investigate further what can be done about the pressure and gas differential to remediate the situation? Carry on gentlemen.<br />
*Skig looks at the Betazed woman.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, I was distracted from making rebreathers for them all.<br />
*Skig looks at Yalak.*<br />
**Oakadan:** Yessir<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can you work with Viraseti to come up with a list of everyone here and dispense masks to everyone while we investigate further.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Dr. Gallego, isn't there some sort of plant that can reverse that reaction? Why can't we get that counter-exponentiating the tribbles till we deal with them?<br />
*Skig admires porcine man's lustrous hair for a second.*<br />
*Skig looks back at the Betazed woman.*<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** At least someone here is thinking <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I believe we were not introduced, I am Lt. Commander Skig of the USS Lister. You are?<br />
*Luatoria Dural places a hand on Gra'lan's shoulder*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Luatoria Dural (to skig):** Otherwise occupied<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** Why don't you tell me about your bold plan to deal with this<br />
*Luatoria Dural rubs a hand over Gra'lan's bald head*<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti raises an eyebrow toward Skig*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Oh wow. <br />
**Gra'lan:** I don't have a plan. We found some of the little'uns in the wiring, but these figures over here estimate yall got about 10 million of em now. No way to stop them now but to get rid of their food.<br />
**Gra'lan:** And no way to stop their emissions except some of the biological exponentiating systems<br />
**Gra'lan:** We just don't have mechanical scaling power like that. Not since they banned grey-goo.<br />
*Skig checks with the medical records on the Lister to see if Betazed's are (a) immune to this combination of gasses or (b) react to this mixture of gasses as an aphrodisiac.*<br />

*Gra'lan turns bright red.*<br />

Failed on DC: 1 [2d20 = 34]**<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** I guess you haven't known many Betazed women, they can get like this when they're older<br />
**Gra'lan:** Dr. Gallego, what's your doctorate in?<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Conservation Ecology<br />
**Gra'lan:** besides getting people angry enough to chase you with paperwork?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Ah ha!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'm not angry Gra'lan, I'm dissapointed and judgemental<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, if Dr Gallego and Lt. Gra'lan can work on mass producing a counteragent via natural means that would be good.<br />
**Yalak:** I am more concerned with how so many tribbles can be active right now<br />
**Yalak:** I thought they weren't supposed to undergo another breeding cycle for years<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Who would be the tribble expert among this science station's staff?<br />
**Oakadan:** I can't get a clean scan in the area, but I think we should check to see if the surroundings are just as saturated or if it's just the facility <br />
**Gra'lan:** Dr. Gallego, can we do a computer search to scour the knowledge of what is known about tribbles and work from there?<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** I have a decent familiarity with them, we don't really have an on-site expert, they mostly take care of themselves<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oakadan, let me introduce you to science officer Viraseti, who can probably work with you to come up with a scanning solution.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Ordinarily, they have a periodic lifecycle. Like Cicadas back on Earth<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** When they undergo a breeding cycle, they emerge in huge numbers and congregate together to breed<br />
**Gra'lan:** Right, but if tribbles make gas, then something certainly evolved to make use of that plentiful energy. An ecosystem is just a degenerate circuit. What creature is that, that's what I want to find?<br />
**Oakadan:** Lt Commander. Shall we? We may need to go a fair distance to avoid contamination <br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Their last breeding cycle was only 3 years ago, and it is ordinarily a 9-12 year cycle<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes. I am not done with you Camilo<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will make sure you two have a chance to complete any unfinished business before we leave.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti heads off with Oakadan while Gra'lan and Dr. Gallego head to Dr. Gallego's office to consult the records on Tribbles*<br />
*Skig sighs in relief at being left alone, goes to make herself some more coffee.*<br />

>INTERIOR - USS Lister, crew quarters: Throk, Garet and T'Kor all recieved a mysterious summons from Lt. Malat ordering them to come to her quarters, when they come inside they find her sitting there with a pile of PADDs in front of her.<br />

*Skig checks on dashingly handsome Yalak to see if the occupants are getting proper medical attention and rebreather units.*<br />
**Geret:** Standing at attention, Lt. Malat!<br />
*Lt. Malat ushers T'Kor, Throk and Geret through the door, then locks it*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Shut up<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** This is off-the-record<br />
**Geret:** but but.....ok./<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I am pretty confident that this mission falls into the category of "Some absolute bullshit"<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So no one is going to miss us if we spend some time snooping around<br />

**T'kor:** Why do you have so many PADDs<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I am investigating the senior staff<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Because, apparently, one of them tried to assassinate the president of the Federation<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And Skig, the only one we know isn't involved, is on the planet. So I am left with you three to work with<br />

**Throk:** Throk also certain this mission in category of "some absolute bullshit" because he saw Skig's latest report and situation on ground smells much like terrestrial bovine flatulence.<br />
**Throk:** Throk amazed small angry woman able to determine bullshit smell from orbit. Your species have good nostrils.<br />
**T'kor:** Knowing Skig, though, she certainly just scanned it<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think we can all agree that Starfleet is an important organization that provides many vital services to the Federation. But at the same time, some missions are just some bullshit<br />
*Throk is amazed how Bachar's arm stretches from out-of-scene to hand a water spritzer bottle to Malat.*<br />
**Geret:** But there's priceless species down there being conserved! <br />
**T'kor:** I think there is a fair amount of diplomacy going on sometimes, rather than any underlying scientific or emergency issue. <br />
**Geret:** Having planets like this escape the ruthless industrialization, or the scourge of intergalacic war is the gem of what the Federation stands for!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There are hundreds of thousands of class-M planets in the Federation, with trillions upon trillians of lifeforms on them<br />
**T'kor:** Though also, even the most menial tasks always seem to be unexpectedly complicated. My time among my people was far less notable<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Forgive me if I am not worried about the survival of the Tarkelian Lantern Beetle<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think "presidential assassin is your superior officer" is a bigger problem<br />
**Throk:** Throk felt that way once, then he challenged senior officer to cage match and ate loser. Now he sent on Starfleet exchange program.<br />
**Throk:** Now, Throk not worry about bigger problems.<br />
**Geret:** But but...Zox-senpai taught me that all life is to be treasured, and that even humans were just these adorable, seemingly helpess creatures when they left Earth. <br />
**Geret:** Tarkelian beetles might one day achieve something incredible!<br />
*T'kor turns full body to face Geret*<br />
*Lt. Malat facepalms*<br />
**T'kor:** Security Officer Zox may be many things, but compasionate about all life is not one of them<br />
*Throk sighs.*<br />
*T'kor pulls up a feed of Zox blowing up an entire rural village*<br />
**Throk:** You two make small angry woman sad and grumpy sigh noises. Behave.<br />
**Geret:** I know I know, but that left him an emotional rex on the inside.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well speaking of Zox, it would be good if we can clear his name. If for no other reason, he is the chief of security. His help could be useful in running this down<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And if he is involved, I will personally skin him and use him as a decorative throw run<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: rug*</font><br />
**Throk:** Throk reasonably certain Zox was not involved in assassination attempt of president.<br />
*Lt. Malat slides some PADDs across the table *<br />
**Throk:** According to medical records, he suffered no serious injury for 48 hours before or after attempted assassination.<br />
*Geret smiles*<br />
**Throk:** Clearly, absence of life threatening injury means he was not involved, based on service record.<br />
**T'kor:** As I have reminded Skig several times, that would be against Star Fleet protocol<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I pulled up everyone's personnel records to see if anything jumped out, but all of them had a posting that would have given them the opportunity<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (T'kor): Investigated for muy thai</font><br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm actually not very experienced with investigating crimes, I have more experience on the other end of an investigation<br />
**Throk:  [d100 = 97]**<br />
**T'kor:** Skig gave an update that our current Bachar is not actually Bachar. Amondi Bachar is unfortunately dead, and a Changeling has been acting in her place for quite some time. I think it's fair to say that the fact that Jasanis had to jump her, and thus alert us of their scheme, clears her of conspiring like that. <br />

**T'kor:** In addition, there was an apparent hijacking of Zox's suit. Unfortunately, due to the interference, I was unable to confirm any specific data information regarding that, but it's clear in the audio. <br />
**T'kor:** If we can figure out who would have taken control of the suit, that may give us a lead<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ok, I must have hit my head because "The XO is probably trustworthy because she's a changeling" is making some sense to me...<br />
**T'kor:** Plenty of changelings are trustworthy. Look at Lt Geret<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She tried to impersonate Zox literally three days ago<br />
**Geret:** eh? Totally not related!<br />
**Geret:** That was part of the mission!<br />
*Throk looks at Malat closely and snaps fingers near one side of her head.*<br />
**Throk:** Hmm... eye response is normal, I do not think you have concussion.<br />
**T'kor:** Do we want to call Bachar in and get their end of things?<br />
*Throk blinks.*<br />
**T'kor:** Or shall we do further investigation first?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** No need<br />
*Geret Dramatic Gasp!*<br />
*Commander Bachar is suddenly standing in the corner*<br />
**Throk:** Walking BBQ unit missed smell of Bachar's perfume.<br />
**Throk:** Also, missed appearance of spritzer bottle.<br />

**Throk:** Throk appreciate that small angry woman and super flexible woman are both higher rank and dutifully follows orders.<br />
**T'kor:** When did you replace Bachar?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Ensign Bachar was captured and killed by the Jem'Hadar while conducting espionage in the Gamma quadrant in 2371, I took advantage of the situation to escape the link and took her place<br />
**T'kor:** Why did you request the transfer to the Lister?<br />
*Throk offers some chewing gum to Malat so she doesn't damage her teeth from the grinding noise.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I didn't request a transfer to the Lister, I requested a transfer to fill the open first officer posting on the USS Resolute<br />
**Throk:** Small angry woman not want to injure self and require medical treatment under current situation.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** When I got assigned here, I suspected something was up<br />
**Geret:** But...if you know everything, and see everything, and still don' know what's going on...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Whoever is behind this is good, very good<br />
**Throk:** Throk convinced Zox now completely innocent.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Yeah, I am inclined to agree. <br />
**T'kor:** Indeed. Which then brings us down to the question of who has the technical capabilities to hack into Zox's suit<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If he pulled one over on me, I would resign<br />
**Geret:** Hrm. It's unlikely any one person could be this proficient. Someone would need a 24-7 accomplice. <br />
**Geret:** Like, ya know, two people.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I agree that we can't assume it is only one person<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** This Janus that Skig told T'Kor about may or may not be the same as whoever was involved in the assassination, and may or may not be the same as whoever hacked Zox's suit<br />
**Throk:** There are many threads here, like excessive plate of all you can eat spaghetti when replicator on deck 18 breaks.<br />
**T'kor:** It looks like Dr Zerra lost someone in 2370. Who would that have been? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Looks like his brother<br />
**T'kor:** Malat, how did you get in Star Fleet the second time? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Starfleet believes in second chances, it takes more than an expulsion to get me down<br />
**T'kor:** I commend you for your determination<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** More importantly: Malat was in lockup when the assassination attempt happened, so we can be confident she wasn't involved<br />
**Throk:** So we need to find who tried hacking Zox suit? Also need to investigate service records and postings for location in 2379, and removing those who are definitely not suspicious, like small angry woman and Zox.<br />
**Throk:** Also safe to assume that gooey flexible woman is not assassin, unless her goal is to mislead everyone.<br />
*Throk sniffs at Bachar.*<br />
**Throk:** Nope, I think she safe.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If I was an assassin I would have blown up the shuttle full of people who learned about the presence of an assassin<br />
**Throk:** See, further proof.<br />
**Throk:** Throk have silly question.<br />
**Throk:** How we know geriatric captain not involved?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We have been keeping this pretty quiet, only myself and Dr. Zerra know about it, but the Captain has a degenerative brain disease. He can barely remember where he is at any given time<br />
**Geret:** I thought that was the cocktails...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I have to brief him four or five times a day so he can stay on top of things<br />
**Geret:  [d100 = 16]**<br />
**T'kor:** Who did you assault in 2379?<br />
**Throk:** Starfleet take better care of old people than Gorn. In Gorn space we coat in thick layer of sauce and toss on to walking BBQ pit to celebrate life.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Captain of the K'Tora<br />

**Throk:** It seems most likely Dr Zerra, Viraseti, or Twins are suspects.<br />
**Throk:** Twins are currently with Murray and Zox.<br />
**Throk:** I assume Murray is not suspicious because she is too violent to assassinate without use of explosives.<br />
**Geret:** I will take care of investigating the twins, who, are in  my appraisal, the most likely, because they have a perfect partner in crime that they are emotionally blackmailed to.<br />
**Throk:** Murray would not use poison, she much prefer explosives or vsiceral stabbing with knife with excessive glee on face, much like when she saws Nausicaan heads off.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If you feel you need permission to access any of their personal logs or enter their quarters, consider it given<br />
**Throk:** In fact, now Throk think about it, Murray look much happier stabbing people than when pregnant with Zox's children.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If there is any inquest in the future, I'll take full responsibility for any violations of protocol here<br />
**Throk:** Mammals are weird creatures.<br />
**Geret:** Commander Bachar, can you resolve one point of ambiguity here?<br />
**Geret:** Can you confirm that neither the twins, either of them, Zerra, or Viraseti, is a founder themselves?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** No way, we can feel one-another with physical contact<br />
**Geret:** Thank you! That reduces variables by much!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** It's why I shook your hand when Skig told me you were a changeling impersonaing Zox<br />
**Throk:** Throk remind that Twins are with Murry and Zox. Zox suit was hacked by Lister. Therefore, if Twins are prime suspect, they have help from someone here.<br />
**Geret:** but we are different. interesting.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or they have a data uplink<br />
**Geret:** Or they use a relay. <br />
**Geret:** Yes.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe you're not as stupid as you look<br />
*Geret changes to look exactly like Malat.*<br />
**Geret:** do I look smart now?<br />
*Throk hands Malat a Klingon Bat'leth in case she wants to smack Geret with it.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Knock it off, we don't have time for this <br />
**Throk:** Time is ephemeral and can be adjusted as needed.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I have to brief the captain... again.. You four figure out how Zox's suit got hacked, and see what else you can find<br />
**Geret:** Oh it commander!<br />
**Geret:** We will make you proud!<br />
>INTERIOR - Transport: Zox, Murry, Kolea and the Twins fly towards a rendezvous with Dr. Malov and his newly unionized crew.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That was a refreshing diversion! So bizzare to be so relaxed on a planet full of Jem'Hadar.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It was an.. unexpected outcome<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** However, we consider it a hopeful sign that the Jem'Hadar could someday become less of a threat to peace<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Assuming the Dominion do not wipe them out<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are approaching the rendezvous position, the FFI beacon on Jasanis' ship has apparently reactivated with a registry title of "Solidarity"<br />
**Kolea:** I certainly hope the Jem'Hadar are able to survive and adapt, it was very nice to see an alternative version of them.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 the twins bring the shuttle in and land in the docking back of the newly named Solidarity*<br />
>When the hatch opens, you see Dr. Malov and several of his Nausicaan crew waiting to greet you at the base of the ramp<br />

**Dr. Malov:** It's a pleasant surprise to see you again so soon<br />
*Kolea looks for statue of Jimmy Hoffa.*<br />
**Kolea:** It is always a pleasure to see you.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I was just thinking the same thing<br />
*Kolea gives Dr Malov "elevator eyes" in return.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So what brings you out here? Other than the obvious<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Has the Ferengi gone into shock or has he found a way to profit by these new arrangements?<br />
**Kolea:** I'm here for the booty call.<br />
*Kolea smacks Dr Malov on the ass and walks out of the hangar.*<br />
*Zox is still confused by mammals.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I convinced him that his labor was being exploited in his prior position, and he can benefit from the full value of his hard work under a more equitable system<br />
**Dr. Malov:** And after we dropped off Jasanis at her rendezvous, we even found time to hold our first union elections<br />
*Kolea wanders back over.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So that the voice of the workers can be realized<br />
**Kolea:** How did that go?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Well, I was elected as our official union representative<br />
**Kolea:** Good choice.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So I have now assumed command of the Solidarity<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Where is he now?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** On the other hand, I had advocated that we redirect our efforts into using the production facilities we acquired from Jasanis to conduct medical research and produce much needed medical supplies for the needy<br />
**Dr. Malov:** But my preferred outcome was defeated by a 2/3 majority in the union election<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So what will be your specialty now?<br />
*Dr. Malov all of the Nausicaans pull out their distruptors and begin taking the phasers from Zox and his team*<br />
>all of the Nausicaans pull out their distruptors and begin taking the phasers from Zox and his team<br />

**Dr. Malov:** Unfortunately, the crew elected to begin a kidnapping business<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I am terribly sorry about that<br />
