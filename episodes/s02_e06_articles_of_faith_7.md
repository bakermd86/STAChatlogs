>INTERIOR - Delta Flyer - Zox and the rest of the away team rematerialize on the transporter pad. They move the Flyer to a safe distance and watch as... nothing happens. No sign of an explosion on the surface, and no energy surge is detected.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well....I mean you have a fair tactical point....but we can invert that. They will surely try to bait us with some, and we just have to appear none the wiser.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** But if they know we can track the strings, surely that makes it harder for them to put spys on the Lister again<br />

I'm not sure what they set off, if anything. Knowing him, it's just a self destruct that's twice as long to try and trick us back onto the station<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh no, the last time I ended up in an escape pod after someone faked a self destruct it got me a mean nickname for my entire final semester at the academy<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** What was the nickname?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** They called me "little princess" which didn't even make sense because the pyjamas had unicorns on them and not princesses<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Make sure you run anything through the data parsing matrix on a 7E0 serialization decoder. All of Starfleet uses 8N1, so if the data contains a self-destructive read payload it won't fry the ship's computer, then reconstruct it with the right encoding after a binary XOR function.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** You see: there was another girl in my class that didn't like me for some reason, and she once did the same thing to me when we were on our field rotations. She reprogrammed the comms in my quarters to play a self-destruct warning in the middle of the night. I ran for the escape pods in my unicorn pyjamas and then everyone thought that was funny and the name sort of stuck<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Data is mostly quarantined per Geret's suggestion.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ghex, it could have been worse, you might not have been wearing pajamas.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** No, I always wear pyjamas when I sleep. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** It could've also been a real self destruct, leaving you as the only survivor<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Good idea.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well that would be a pretty extreme prank, I am pretty sure they would have washed her out of the academy if she activated the actual self-destruct just to prank me.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** You don't flunk out of the Academy, you just get assigned to the Lister.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Oh wait. I wasn't supposed to say that.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Yes, he would have to be very close<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Scanning for ships is one thing, I would also suggest scanning for blank spots that indicate *nothing* exists there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I have isolated the residual power signature of the subspace holo-interface. I am reading a low-level warp signature there.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** No, this was the terminus of the string we were tracking. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Hmm...curious. We need to learn how those work if it ends here, where there is no connecting creature.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Or maybe I was missing part of the explanation and it was detached. In any case, Zox, are we following the signal?<br />

>Ghex sets off in pursuit of the warp signature, as they get near she swings the Flyer around a plasma streamer to hide their power signature. As she does, the source of the warp signature comes into view at the far-end of the Flyer's sensor range: a Defian class escort.<br />

>It is travelling on a bearing heading out of the Badlands, but it can't maneuver or navigate as quickly as the Flyer inside.<br />

>Ghex fires the Zox Torpedo as soon as the computer obtains a firing solution. The torpedo streaks off through the plasma storms towards the ship.<br />

*Skig writes a note to Darisha-Han, "Maybe because we are preventing cultural contamination of their species in accordance to the Prime Directive, beaming them on to the ship would... Oh FFS, nevermind."*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Thank you. Our position is clear: the plain text of Appendix J.4 is clear: "The parties agree that vessels operating under their flag shall conduct no salvage operations of these vessels" It is completely clear that the text of the appendix as adpoted by the five parties to the agreement prohibits their plundering of salvage from our vessel.<br />

<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Exactly :3</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Their claim of mixed salvage rights based on the presence of the orb is absurd. It is clear from the surrounding text that the mixed salvage provisions exist for the purpose of sites containing wreckage from more than one vessel covered by the appendix, and not for vessels containing objects which a third-party claims ownership over.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Our view is that the retrieval of this orb is clearly a salvage operation in violation of Appendix J.4. And we would ask the mediator to rule in our favor, and ensure that all legally covered wreckage be returned to the Cardassian Union with immediate effect.<br />
*Gul Bemek sits back down.*<br />
>Thank you, Commander Murry you may now make your opening statement.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Thank you, Commander Murry you may now make your opening statement.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Pelarians</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We do not seek to dispute the apprendix, as adopted by the five parties which prohibits the plundering of salvage from Cardassian vessels. However, it's important to note that we came across the Orb without even being aware that there was salvage, and when we obtained the orb it was not from the wreckage. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** This being their planet, the Pelarians found the Orb long ago. As is clear from the records and studies of their culture, it's been a part of their society for decades now. Not only are the Pelarians not signatories of the appendix, but the retrieval of the Orb happened far before the treaty was signed. <br />
*Darisha-Han takes notes as a venerable federation officer engages arguments in a dispassionate, civilized fashion.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Given that the signatories agree in Appendix P.1 that the Orbs are the rightful property of Bajor as being important spiritual artifacts, and given that this Orb was not a part of any salvage we had anything to do with, we do not believe that Appendix J.4 is relevant here.<br />
*Hailey Murry sits back down*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Thank you. In my opinion, we must first determine whether Appendix J.4 attaches to the retrieval of the orb. Gul Bemek, Commander Murry makes the argument that the orb is no longer salvage due to the Pelarians' having retrieved it long ago. This seems like a logical position. Your response.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** When a vessel crashes on a planet, the wreckage of the ship and its contents can be spread over a wide area. The fact that a piece of cargo was not co-located with the other wreckage does not suddenly make it not-salvage.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** And the fact that the Pelarians may have moved the orb at some point does not alter the salvage restrictions in place on the Federation. If a bird had moved it, it would still be salvage. If the wind blew it down a hill, it would still be salvage. The fact that a primitive, pre-technological race with no knowledge of space flight may have disturbed some of the wreckage is not a salvage operation. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The items which they may have moved are still active salvage, just as they would be if an animal had moved them.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** It would be absurd to suggest that an ape could pick up the orb and it would suddenly cease to be covered by the salvage provisions of the agreeement. And it is just as laughable to suggest that a pre-technological race disturbing the wreckage is sufficient to count as the beginning of a salvage operation.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The key difference between mere animals and a sentient and cultured people should be clear to all present in the room. The Pelarians may not be a space-faring race, but they certainly possess the intelligence and agency to recognize and conduct a salvage. As evidence of this are their buildings and inventions, their language and social hierarchies, and their communion with the Orb of Insight itself. They did not merely "disturb the wreckage", they very clearly claimed the orb and incorporated it into a full temple. <br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Dr. Lázaro</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'd like to call Dr. Lázaro to the stand to discuss their incorporation of the orb into their culture, and I'd like to call Vedek Ojun to the stand to testify about the abilities of the orbs to connect to sentience.<br />
*Dr. Lázaro walks from the gallery to the witness table*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Dr. Lázaro, you are a leading expert in the Pelarian people, yes? <br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Yes, my team has been here studying them for three years<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Would you say, before two weeks ago, were they fervent or tepid Richard Nixon supporters?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The Pelarians have been compared here with mere birds and apes. Do these seem to be accurate comparisons to you based on your studies? <br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): The Pelarians are at war, with one side claiming pokemon is the one true creature battler, while the other insists digimon is the genuine article and pokemon a mere pretender.</font><br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Well in a sense we are all animals, but no. The Pelarians are an intelligent species with a level of cultural complexity similar to humans around 10,000 years ago.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): So, they understand that rocks are not edible and think caves are great places to live.</font><br />
*Darisha-Han waits for a cuneiform tablet complaining about the grades of copper ingots.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** And with that level of cultural complexity, assuming they understand or find the value in it, would they have the ability to recognize and conduct a salvage for materials and resources? <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Amazingly, bronze and copper both survive far better than iron does. Viking Museum in Dublin is really cool, I highly recommend it.</font><br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Oh yes. In fact, the recent revelation that there is a crashed Cardassian vessel on the planet explains some mysteries about the Pelarians. We have observed them wearing jewelry made of advanced alloys which we were unsure how they could have made. It is entirely plausible that they made those pieces by reshaping metal salvaged from the crashed Cardassian vessel.<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Cardassians switch their request to demand we give the Orb back to the Pelerians, on the theory they can just carpet bomb them all after we leave and take it from their cold dead hands.</font><br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Well we were not aware of the orb's existence. We had not yet excavated a tunnel to gain access to their temple.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Fen... well it wasn't before, but now that you mention it...</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What sort of temple was it stored in? Minor? Major?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Fortunately, the Pelarians are the Star Trek embodiment of the Death Korps of Krieg, so the Cardassians have no idea how screwed they are.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Rest of Star Trek has the same opinion of the "Prime Directive" that Kirk does.</font><br />
**Dr. Lázaro** The temple was constructed around a shallow cave just outside the village in the foothills of the mountains. The orb was inside the cave, so we had not observed it previously. We had been working on a new excavation to gain access to the temple for observation, but it was a few months away from being completed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** When was the temple constructed?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** The buildings ranged in age but the oldest temple structures were around 50 years old, there is also some rubble of older, destroyed buildings around the site of the temple<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Would you have been able to notice the Orb if it were out in the open, as opposed to deep underground?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Oh yes, if they had taken it out into the open we would have been able to observe it. For the entire time we have bene here, we have never seen them remove it from the cave in the temple<br />
*Darisha-Han notes this seems less than the random behavior suggested by Gul Bemek.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Doctor, would you say that such protectiveness of the orb would indicate non-random, intentional behavior, far more advanced than 'mere animals'?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Thank you, Dr. Lázaro. And Vedek Ojun?<br />
*Darisha-Han looks inquisitive, holding a notepad and pen (do people even have these still?)*<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Yes, their behavior is certainly intentional<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** If I understood your testimony correctly doctor: you have never witnessed the Pelarians moving the orb, it that correct?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Yes, that is correct.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** And you describe the orb as having been located in a cave or cavern of some sort. Tell me, did you study the geology of this cave at all?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** No, we are anthroplogists<br />
*Skig is more curious at the line of questioning than anything else so far and stops trying to visualize flow emitters in tachyon relays to pass the time.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I see, well my vessel has taken scans of the cave since we arrived. Our anslysis suggests that the cave is consistent with an impact crater.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Given the reluctance of the Pelarians to move the orb, is it possible that they have NEVER moved the orb? That its location in the cave was the location it landed when it fell out of the vessel as it broke up in the atmosphere?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** I suppose I can't rule that out.<br />
*Darisha-Han looks incredibly geeked about using a polaroid as evidence.*<br />
*Skig has the Lister run a scan of the cave to validate or invalidate the Cardassian's assessment.*<br />

*Skig passes a note to Murry, "It is entirely possible the Cardassians are correct and somehow it is from an impact crater...but the evidence for or against is inconclusive."*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'd like to call Vedek Ojun to testify about the Orb<br />
*Skig clearly we just need to bring the Pelarian on board and have them testify they carried the Orb back from the salvage.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Clearly we just need to bring the Pelarian on board and have them testify they carried the Orb back from the salvage.</font><br />
*Hailey Murry passes a note back to Skig, "Even if they've left it where it's fallen, it's clearly incorporated into their practices as one of their belongings."*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Before we hear from Vedek Ojun, I believe it is logical to first investigate this important question of fact which Gul Bemek has raised. If the orb crashed in this location and the Pelarians did not move it, then they could not have logically conducted a salvage operation pertinent to Appendix J.4<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): The presence of jewelry and other items would imply they had been to the wreck site.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** If this is indeed what happened, then I will have no choice but to rule in the Cardassians' favor. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I would disagree with that. Even if they have left it physically where they lay, they have clearly incorporated the Orb into their culture. Similar to if they had built a town or city around the wreckage of the ship, that would still be their salvage even if it were left where it originally fell. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** I will grant the parties a four hour recess to investigate this issue of fact. If the evidence indicates that the orb was not removed to this location by the Pelarians, then I will have to rule in favor of Gul Bemek and the Cardassian Union.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** I do not follow your logic commander: if the Pelarians never moved the orb, then they conducted no salvage. If they conducted no salvage operation, then the salvage operation began when your officer removed the orb from the location where it had landed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** This is an imporant question of fact, one that we cannot logically ignore.<br />
