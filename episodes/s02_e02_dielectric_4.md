**Ensign Ghex (Comms)** Yes ma'am, I'm here. Just working. I had a few calibration tasks that needed to be done, and I figure that it was a good time to do it because we are in orbit and we are not planning to leave anytime soon you know? Are leaving soon? I may have to finish this calibration later and bring the navigational sensors back online if we need to break orbit<br />

So per regulations, the captain would have to give approval to anyone coming on board. The pakleds did bring some supplies on board with permission for "religious purposes" but to be honest, I think this religion is kind of a bunch of made up nonsense. Although, I guess in a sense, all religions are made up so maybe it isn't really that different<br />
