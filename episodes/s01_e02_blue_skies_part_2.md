Written By Nadia MacLeod
Directed By Apolena Christianson<br />

>INTERIOR - Crew Lounge: As the red alert klaxon blares, any further response to Zox's violent outburst is cut short as Tural stands up and leaves. All of the attendees begin streaming out of the lounge, leaving the away team, Anjek , and Botok behind.<br />

>The ship begins maneuvering, and the Cardassian cruiser is no longer visible through the large windows in the crew lounge<br />

**Chief Botok:** Well that puts a bit of a damper on the festivities, eh sir?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Or extra explosives to the festivities<br />
*Zox rushes to the armory.*<br />
*Hailey Murry pulls out a note pad to take notes for future reference*<br />
**Chief Botok:** Is your duty station in engineering? Where can I be of some use?<br />
*Captain Baras pulls Murry and Zox aside from Skig and Botok*<br />
*Hailey Murry looks down at the notepad as she realizes she won't get to take it with her. She sighs and takes notes anyways*<br />
*Zox stands at attention.*<br />
**Captain Baras:** What do you think? Is this a temporal event, or something else?<br />
**Skig:** It is, we need to get down there.<br />
*Skig is talking to Chief Botok.*<br />
**Captain Baras:** I'm concerned about any actions we take affecting the timeline, even if that possibility is remote<br />
**Zox:** Too late.<br />
**Chief Botok:** Naturally, lead the way Lieutenant. I may be old, but I'm still worth my weight in a fire-fight<br />
**Skig:** Let's go, we will need to reroute extra power to the shields because the torpedoes on that ship will crumple our standard arrays.<br />
*Chief Botok heads toward the turbolift with Skig*<br />
*Skig heads out the door, oblivious to the rest of the away team, as her ship is in danger.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I think we're in a dream, rather than a temporal event. It's quite likely, given the ionic storm was causing us to pass out, that the frequencies in the storm are responding to our brainwaves. After all, in a temporal event the crew would see us as strangers rather than responding as if we're additional crew. <br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree it seems implausible, but it could be temporal-cognitive displacement<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Our cognition could have been displaced into other bodies, near to Skig's location<br />
*Zox appears confused by this talk.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I do think we need to take care not to have bad things happen to us, though. In a normal dream, we wake up when startled. I don't think the storm will permit that, though, so if someone were to become grievously injured during the course of the dream they may be stuck like that until we're able to awaken<br />
*Zox Searches for weapons.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Possible, but we're able to recognize each other for who we are<br />
**Zox: [ REASON  (7) +  SECURITY  (4)]

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 12]**<br />
*Hailey Murry gestures towards the dinosaur*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Agreed, caution is warranted, and the temporal concerns seem unlikely here<br />
**Captain Baras:** In that case, we had better get to engineering ourselves. If we ARE in the place of engineers, we don't want to leave the ship short-handed in a battle<br />
**Captain Baras:** Unless anyone has any more prudent suggestions<br />
**Zox:** I see no reason to behave differently if this is a hallucination versus the past.<br />
**Zox:** or _a_ past.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** What do you normally dream about, Zox? <br />
*Hailey Murry leads the way toward engineering*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** With your permission sir, I'm going to head to Stellar Cartography. I'd like to see if I can use the ship's sensors to look for any signs of temporal interference. Just in case we are wrong<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti takes her leave*<br />
**Zox:** Green leaves as far as one can see, a never ending migration through viridian fields.<br />
*Skig is unaware of this, and hopes Viraseti survives when Stellar Cartography takes a plasma torpedo to the hull.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Engineering: Skig and Botok arrive in engineering first, and the scene is pure chaos. The ship is being rocked by impacts from Cardassian weapons, and damage control teams and running in all directions.<br />

**Zox:** Cardassians generally do not find that compelling.<br />
**Tural:** Skig, your timing is impecable. We have a containment field overload in progress, get up there and see what is causing it.<br />
**Skig:** Right<br />
**Chief Botok:** Lead the way Lietenant, you know your ship<br />
*Chief Botok grabs a toolkit from the supply locker as he follows Skig*<br />
**Skig:** Botok, can you work from that console on controlling the power flows appropriately while I climb through the Jeffries Tubes up to the relay conduit?<br />
**Chief Botok:** Aye sir<br />
*Skig takes the toolkit from Botok and begins climbing the array.*<br />
*Skig as she departs gives Botok a smile.*<br />
*Chief Botok spryly hops over to the console and begins pressing buttons in a way that implies he may know what he is doing*<br />
**Skig:** And try to keep all the youngsters from panicking.<br />
>As Skig departs up the Jeffries tube, the rest of the away team arrives in the turbolift<br />

**Zox:** Hailey, may I advise we leave this deck. If Skig is correct, it may not be compatible with life for much longer.<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  COMMAND  (3)]

**Tural:** Pederson, Ghex, where have you been? Nevermind, Skig is on the upper deck dealing with a containment flutruation, get up there and help her<br />
**Tural:** If we lose core containment, we lose the ship.<br />
**Tural:** That's an order crewmen<br />
*Tural looks at Zox and Murry impatiently*<br />
**Captain Baras:** I think he's talking to you Commanders<br />
*Hailey Murry gives a salute and leads the way*<br />
**Zox:** Sure.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Try to stick around parts of the ship that you recognize, they're less likely to have been replaced<br />
*Captain Baras heads over to Botok to assist*<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** So, I'm pretty sure this is not the battle that nearly scuttled the Lister<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** So we're probably not in the worst of circumstances<br />
**Zox:** But if we do not do as we need to, it may scuttle it.<br />
*Skig looks surprised to see them arrive.*<br />
**Skig:** Oh, hello.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It would be a little surprising if that were the case, I think<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Good morning, Skig!<br />
**Skig:** I fixed the problem, it helps having hindsight.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh, excellent<br />
**Skig:** How is everyone else doing?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Judging from our discussions in the past, I was confident you'd have this handled<br />
**Skig:** Yes, yes, wonderful.<br />
*Skig is clearly distracted.*<br />
*Zox Takes position by a door.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Viraseti has gone up to Stellar Cartography to check on some scans, I think Captain Baras is following Chief Botok<br />
**Skig:** Viraseti should be safe there, I had a flashback of a different situation and thought she might be in danger, but not today.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We left Anjek with Captain Baras. Now that I think about it, we should probably keep her close and provide some moral support. She's more alone than the rest of us are here. <br />
**Skig:** Who?<br />
**Skig:** Oh sure, yes, do that.<br />
*Skig resumes staring at a console in front of her while twiddling with an electric spanner in one hand.*<br />
*Skig presses comm button badge.*<br />
**Skig:** Tural, we should have enough power now to evade the Cardassian and keep our shields angled behind us.  How are we doing?<br />
*Hailey Murry steps up behind Skig and sips her coffee, keeping an eye on the situation*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** If I may ask, what originally happened?<br />
*Skig switches to "Screen Saver 3" on console 2.*<br />
**Tural:** Main power is back online, the captain has ordered evasive action. Your work up there is adequate, but I could use your assistance here if you are finished<br />
**Skig:** Understood, I'm on my way with Pederson and Ghex.<br />
*Skig turns off comm badge.*<br />
**Skig:** Botok climbed up the tube ahead of me, was lacerated by a electrical discharge, and died several minutes ago while I was getting burned badly forcing cabling back together to stop a core breach.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** That...would have been a very troublesome position to be in<br />
**Skig:** Hindsight being perfect, this time he did not climb up, I took the left side of the tube, and remembered to take the gloves with me when I need to touch the raw coils.<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
*Zox begins to think about installing some additional signs advertising the proper use of PPE in engineering.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I was telling Zox, I think we're in a dream of sorts. Reliving an event. We'll check back with Viraseti to confirm. However, unlike a normal dream I don't think we'll wake up if...otherwise lethal things happen. <br />
**Skig:** Although I realize that sometimes my memory of today and my memories of Betazed seem to be interchangeable.<br />
*Skig leads the others back to Tural.*<br />

>As the away team climb down the ladder in the Jeffries Tube, the ship is rocked heavily by another impact and Hailey loses her grip on the ladder and falls down from the upper deck to the floor of the access room below<br />

>Zox is able get an arm around Murry as she falls, and she is able to get her feet back under her before she lands on the tritanium below<br />

>As Hailey lands, she sets off the door sensor and the door opens on an engineering in just as much chaos as before. Tural is barking orders and Botok and Captain Baras are both lying on their backs near the warp core working on a coolant leak<br />

**Zox:** Skig, can we not return fire? Evasive action seems something for Romulan cowards.<br />

*Captain Baras sees Zox approaching and stands up*<br />
**Captain Baras:** I take it you were successful up there Skig?<br />
**Skig:** Returning fire would be a decision of command staff above our pay grade, but yes, shooting back in a war is usually a good thing.<br />
*Skig nods at Baras.*<br />
**Captain Baras:** I was assisting the chief here with the coolant leak, but I'm afraid I did poorly in my engineering extension courses at the academy<br />
**Captain Baras:** Also, that was 50 years ago<br />
**Skig:** Things were handled up there.<br />
**Skig:** What coolant leak?<br />
*Skig dives under the warp core to take a look and shoves Botok out of the way of any possible danger.*<br />
*Chief Botok looks slightly put upon*<br />
**Chief Botok:** The antimatter collant tank sprung a leak, nothing to get worked up about Lietenant<br />
**Chief Botok:** I may be old, but I still know a thing or two<br />
*Hailey Murry steadies the Chief*<br />
**Skig:** You old coot, I remember you telling me these triangular feeds are used for Tyson Poultry Field Dampening Relays, and I don't trust you to remember whether the yellow one is used for Hydronic Mustard or Antiphasic Barbecue.<br />
**Skig:** And the last thing we need is to flush the Hidden Valley Decontamination Relay through the Chipotle Mastication Matrix.<br />
**Chief Botok:** Fair enough, I am a guest on your ship today, after all<br />
**Skig:** See, I was paying attention in that class!<br />

*Tural taps his comm badge*<br />
**Tural:** Captain, warp power is available<br />
>Just then, the ship shudders as it jumps to warp. The din of battle slowly fades and is gradually replaced by the hum of the warp core.<br />

**Zox:** Damn. <br />
**Chief Botok:** Well, I am impressed Lietenant. Another year or two and you'll displace that poor Vulcan chap and take over the whole shop<br />
**Skig:** Botok, can you validate the triphasic non-pinion aviary edibility quotient?<br />
*Skig blushes at the compliment from Botok.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Well, I am impressed Lietenant. Another year or two and you'll displace that poor Vulcan chap and take over the whole shop<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d20 = 5]**<br />
**Zox:  [d20 = 13]**<br />
**Skig:** Thank you, I am honored you feel that way, every day in engineering is an opportunity to learn.<br />
>As Chief Botok flashes a smile to Skig, a sudden energy discharge errupts from the warp core, enveloping him and throwing him across the room into Zox<br />

>As the turbolift doors open, the away team step out but find themselves standing behind the bar in the forward lounge.<br />

>Tural is standing there holding out a bottle of Romulan Ale<br />

**Tural:** Hmm. I cannot find fault in your logic. In that case… “Surprise”, Lietenant<br />
**Zox:** Is this one stuck on repeat?<br />
**Skig:** Thank you Tural, I look forward to sharing this with you.<br />

*Zox Makes a tooting noise and offers Skig a large wrapped present.*<br />
**Zox:** Rejoice in your surprise<br />
**Skig:** Ah, the day I argued with you for half an hour, citing a flawed hypothesis that you had to refute a dozen different ways.<br />
**Zox:** Surely this mystery box will give you intrigue as well as a curio.<br />
**Skig:** That was a valuable education in the use of patience of logic to defeat a bullheaded underclassman. I used it constantly for the remaining three years of Starfleet Academy.<br />
*Skig sets the bottle of Romulan Ale on the bar and takes the box from Zox and tries to guess what it is.*<br />
**Skig:** I've always wanted my very own lifesize replica of a core containment field array?<br />
*Skig raises an eyebrow and looks at Zox.*<br />

*Skig looks at Tural.*<br />
**Skig:** This is Pedersen we are talking about.<br />

**Tural:** I was not aware you were fond of music boxes Lieutenant<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I managed to access the sensor array in stellar cartography. In case you were wondering: no signs of any temporal disruptions<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** In fact, there were no signs of almost anything. The ships sensors could only read one thing<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Tellerite lifesigns<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** One in particular<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti looks at Skig*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Commander, I'm not a doctor. But your life signs were fading. Whatever is happening here, it is killing you<br />
*Skig looks around.*<br />

**Skig:** Sucks to be that Tellerite.<br />
**Skig:** Oh wait.<br />
>---------CUT TO COMMERCIAL-------<br />

**Captain Baras:** What do you mean the ship's sensors are picking up Tellerite life signs? You mean you can read the commander's life signs?<br />
**Zox:** Skig, you mean the universe to us...or are the universe now. Either way, you need to wake up.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No sir, they don't register the planet, the Cardassian cruiser, anything. Just one big set of Tellerite life signs<br />
**Skig:** Curious.<br />
*Zox rushes to the bar and begins to make coffee.*<br />
**Skig:** Thanks, I need some of that.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'm not sure I can trust this tricorder, but no one else's life signs are showing signs of distress<br />
**Captain Baras:** Ok, so definitely not time travel...<br />
**Captain Baras:** Murry, what's your take on this?<br />
**Captain Baras:** If this isn't reality, then how do we get out of it?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** My take is a bit frustrated, because I think we may not be sharing a dream<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I think we're all in Skig's dream<br />
*Zox spikes the coffee with Romulan Ale.*<br />

**Captain Baras:** Hard to operate under the opposite assumption<br />
*Zox presents Skig with an appropriately steaming, very aromatic cup, complete with biscuits.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It would be quite a scientific achievement if we were all reincarnated into Skig after this<br />
**Zox:** Merry Hatching Day.<br />
**Skig:** That level of psychotic multiple personalities would diminsh my overall ability to perform repairs.<br />
*Skig takes biscuits and coffee from Zox.*<br />
**Skig:** Happy Ovulation Production Festival to You!<br />
**Captain Baras:** Murry, I am sure that would be fascinating to write a paper about, but I would prefer we all end up in the correct bodies<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Are you sure about that? Your body is pretty old...<br />
**Captain Baras:** You are aware that I am your commanding officer, yes?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Yes, sir!<br />
**Skig:** Indeed, Zox's claws would not help with Murry's tendency to shove her fingers into her temples when she is thinking.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** On the other hand, Zox has a very hard head<br />
*Zox begins to ponder Skig's statement.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It's too bad we didn't bring the twins on this away team, that would be a fascinating wrinkle for this paper you're proposing<br />
*Zox Begins scratching his head.*<br />
**Skig:** Wait... if we are in a loop, the loop started this time on a shorter cycle.<br />
**Skig:** Which would mean the time I have is decreasing until we reach the loop termination because it is too small for a new one to begin.<br />
>As before, the red alert klaxon blares again, and the crew begins to flood out of the lounge to get to their duty stations<br />

**Zox:** Oh no, not again!<br />
**Skig:** I will need to work with Botok to solve this.<br />
**Skig:** The rest of you need to figure out how to break the loop, your characters are not critical to this cycle, but Botok and I are.<br />
**Chief Botok:** If you need me sir, just say the word<br />
**Skig:** That is the key, badge me if you need, but we have to come to the bottom of what is spawning the cycle.<br />
**Skig:** Right Botok, let's get down to engineering and see what is going on.<br />

>As before, a Galor Class Cardassian cruiser appears in the distance, visible through the forward observation windows<br />

**Skig:** In the mean time, I am curious what your take on a decreasing time loop interstital theory would be, as it relates to strong memories from previous events being replayed constantly.<br />
*Hailey Murry presses her Comm Badge and calls out to Skig*<br />
**Chief Botok:** I'll have to give that some thought Lietenant, but perhaps a battle isn't the best time to discuss temporal mechanics<br />
*Skig while in the turbolift, explains in generic terms her theory of being trapped in a circular Groundhog-Day loop and how that would apply to pressing memories.*<br />
**Hailey Murry ***(Comms)*: Skig, I think you should know that this is a very ionically charged Cardassian Cruiser this time<br />
**Zox:** Is it also high in vitamin C?<br />
**Skig:** True, but you are the one who taught me the fine art of taking every opportunity to learn something new and think about different solutions to a problem.<br />
>As the cruiser nears the Lister, instead of disruptors and torpedoes, it begins firing bolts of ionic lightning that rock the ship and knock out power<br />

**Skig ***(Comms)*: Good to know<br />
