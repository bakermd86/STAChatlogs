>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Zox, T'Kor and Throk are attempting to convince Satag to leave the Venonan village alone.<br />

**Satag:** You have raised some interesting viewpoints. I do admit that our actions are imperfect and it would be better for the Venonans to be left alone<br />
**Satag:** But you have again misunderstood our ways. I am not a leader, I do not make the decisions or give orders, I am bound to carry out the consensus<br />
**Satag:** You have given me much to think about, but I must still continue in our course of action. My own feelings on the matter must be subservient to the consensus<br />
>Satag leaves a PADD on the table, then stands up and skitters out of the briefing room without saying another word.<br />

*Hailey Murry picks up the PADD and checks it out*<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SCIENCE  (4)]

**Throk:** Now that big bug man is gone, Throk have question for Zox. Did you feel that big bug man's head, if turned upside down and detached at thorax, would make great container for chilli cheese dip?<br />
*Kolea grabs spray bottle Bachar left behind and squirts Throk.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Depends if you are aiming for single use or not. Chitin may not hold up through the dishwasher.<br />
**Kolea:** Bad Throk! No eating first contact species!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, so the Xepai put a strong emphasis on self improvement, determination, and inquisitiveness. I think the inquisitveness could serve well here alongside the courage that the Venonan cherish<br />
**Zox: [ REASON  (7) +  MEDICINE  (1)]

[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 22]**<br />
**Throk:** I think with proper curing and heat, would make decorative platter for at least ten to fifteen uses.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** What are you thinking Counselor?<br />
**Kolea:** Throk, can you go get us some cookies?<br />
**Throk:** Okay.<br />
*Throk leaves.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We know at least one of them who is a bit upset at everything. Would it be possible for us to camouflage ourselves as Venonan and infiltrate? Sow a little skepticism? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I am not eating any of his cookies after that discussion<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I could surgically alter you to appear Venonan. At least some of you, Zox, Throk and T'Kor have different skeletal structures so we can't adequately disguise them<br />
**T'Kor:** Understandable, I am made quite literally of crystal<br />
**Throk:** That might be a way to get the Venonan's to "figure it out themselves", although I feel like this has a negative implication on the Venonan's strong faith.<br />
**Kolea:** That might be a way to get the Venonan's to "figure it out themselves", although I feel like this has a negative implication on the Venonan's strong faith.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wonder if, without the chance to make painful mistakes and truly learn the self-correcting scientific methods, too harsh a lesson may deprive them of a way to truly mature as citizens of the cosmos.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** To be fair, their strong faith might be due for a little shaking. Are there any other locations of radiation poisoning according to the scanners? <br />
**Kolea:** I would be curious how the other villages that the Xepai said, "figured it out" handled this if there an emphasis on faith. It would be not very Prime-Directive of them to try and "break" that facet of Venonan culture to make them more "pliable" to the consensus.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not at the moment, it looks like this village was the only one which Xepai had not yet repaired<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But we get a free 'we can break the prime directive to save the prime directive' clause. It's stronger than my claws even!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we pull out the three most recent repairs and how those villages handled things? <br />
**Kolea:** I dislike the idea of the Xepai using this village as "guinea pigs" for their consensus experiments.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** According to the database provided by the Xepai, other villages experimented with herbal remedies, culled animal populations suspected of carrying disease, and in one case a village simply relocated their entire population<br />
**Throk:** Throk like guinea pigs, they are delicious with hot mustard.<br />
*Throk hands out cookies and then goes to swab out the biocontainment units in the restrooms.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** None of their efforts were meaningfully successful, but the attempts were enough for the Xepai to step in and correct the underlying issues<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think they're really using them as experiments. I think they're trying to shape or allow the Venonan to be shaped in a way that allows an easy merging with their own Collective.<br />
*Throk does not remember to wash hands regularly, as Gorn have very strong immune systems.*<br />
*Zox eats cookies.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long ago were those fixed?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Within 5-10 years<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we find a good scapegoat that this village had done recently?<br />
*Throk yells from the sludge pit, "Dr Zerra is good scapegoat!"*<br />
*Kolea says nothing, as she doesn't want to get promotion-through-attrition in this episode.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, nevermind, we're a little too different from them<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Wait, what if we beamed them a science educational show? I'd teach them all our ways; it would be called Mr. Lizard. <br />
*Skig snores in the corner.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't think they are going to invent radio or televisual communications technology anytime soon<br />
**Kolea:** Perhaps we should consider what is in the PADD and look at that as a form of guidance.<br />
**Kolea:** We want to show the Xepai that this village is good for the Consensus as is.<br />
**Kolea:** They have failed at pretty much every thing listed as part of the collectivism valued, but we need to show how the Venonans can blend their traits to show self-improvement, determination, and inquisitiveness.<br />
**T'Kor:** That desire is perhaps a little tempered for myself, since I can see where the Collective is coming from with this village. And unfortunately, our level of assistance was too thorough and too notable <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, they definitely have Determination<br />

**Kolea:** Right, we need to have them show individualism and courage as traits which can align with self-improvement and determination.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think this may make me throw up in my mouth: but I like Throk's plan<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Throkk for crewmate of the Month!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Throk's plan is a warcrime<br />
*Kolea checks Lt. Malat's medical records to see if someone has changed her medication.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Obviously you can't murder anyone, but we have 24th century technology. We can put on a pretty good show without killing anyone<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait...I hate to bring this up but...what if they all started to get sick again?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ooh, I like that<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How many of the Venonans actually saw the group of you? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, I look forward to you all over-acting like Earth soap-operas infront of impressionable viewers. I must, however, return this PADD to it's rightful owners.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I saw most of the village while the rest of the away team was in the temple, but the rest of the team only saw 3 Venonans<br />
**Kolea:** We could definitely rig up some way to make them ill through some sort of released aerosol, based on their biological configuration.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** I do not believe they intended for the PADD to be returned<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What if we altered Zerra so he's like a Venonan in disguise, beam him down to readminister the new cure, and play it off as if it was all a complex hoax?<br />
**Kolea:** We could also just have the Dr beam down and, you know, shoot a lot of them with the stun setting and we could... pretend to be horrible slavers and the Venonans fight back and rescue themselves?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** There's still an anti-matter reactor on the fritz down there.<br />
**Kolea:** Wait, that sounds a bit too much like my show after this one, on Cinemax.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The Xepai can repair the reactor if we correct the cultural contanimation <br />
**Kolea:** Or PlayOrion, I forget which, but you get the idea.<br />
*Throk makes popcorn and ensures QR code for Kolea's other show is available in the corner of the screen.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wait, so this whole problem is solved by fixing the reactor?<br />
*Skig woke up when someone mentioned doing an actual engineering/science thing.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, nevermind.<br />
*Skig goes back to sleep.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If you would like to go repair the reactor while we discuss our options, I am sure no one would object<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not envy the repairs on that reactor <br />
**T'Kor:** I'd rather stay safe, like on Old Faithless<br />
>The Captain and Commander re-enter the briefing room<br />

*Zox stands at attention.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I hope you all have some good news to share, Starfleet Command is not pleased with how our first contact with the Xepai has gone thus far<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We only have 10 hours left on Satag's ultimatum, so let's get all of our options on the table and decide on the best course of action here. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We may be able to restore the balance here if we're clever. We were just talking about temporarily making the Venonan ill again, as if that cure was only temporary. Is it possible that we could seed an idea into some of the more restless Venonan so they decide to take the solution into their own hands instead of just accepting faith? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You are the counselor.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or, Dr. Zerra beams down and starts violently terrorizing the village until they rise up and defeat him with their wits and courage<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I typically operate with consent<br />
**T'Kor:** What if they just start praying?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't care how you do it, you must make them stop praying.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well they think you're god, so I guess you terrorize them too?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** That is a horrible plan, I should have you brought up on charges for suggesting it<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** At least Murry's plan isn't a crime<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you<br />
*Hailey Murry beams at the praise*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Alternatively, we can simply leave. This isn't our problem and we aren't required to do anything here. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Here, I can't really help in your play-acting, but I can offer special effects. <br />
*Hailey Murry makes notes for Viraseti's sessions later*<br />
>Zox and Skig explain their plan to to the Captain to have Zerra be "killed" by mosters played by Throk and Zox, and then have the monsters be killed by the locals<br />

**T'Kor:** Excuse me, why is "killed" not in quotes at hte end? I harbor some concerns<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** As a precaution, we should set down some transporter beacons in the area, such that if anything should happen, crew member can be recovered.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We will maintain a transporter lock on you<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This plan does results in fewer moral conundrums for Dr Zerra than the "shoot a lot of them with a Type-2 Phaser" that someone else was suggesting he do.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Right, but with the strange disruptions and the large energy source, it wouldn't hurt to have some support, no?<br />
**Throk:** Throk knows Dr Zerra can find nugget of evil in his heart and let it bloom.<br />

**Throk:** Throk realizes this plan has high chance of his death, but it is risk he is willing to take for good of Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it'd be a better idea to take a more subtle approach. Disguise some of us as travelling Venonans, then mingle with the group and stoke some of the concerns and inflate their conspiracy thoeries. Gaslight them so they don't believe in the recent events, helped by temporarily re-poisoning some of them. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That only works in an advanced civilization you are trying to destabilize. <br />
**Kolea:** I think that is a great suggestion, Counselor.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's never going to work in a small tribe where communication can't be gamed.<br />
**Throk:** Throk agree with Zox, these people not advanced to have lights which use gas.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I think that Murry's plan is much safer, no one is going to be shot in the neck with an arrow in her plan<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** C'mon doc, no one joined Starfleet to be safe<br />
**T'Kor:** Technically, that is not a guarantee<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Live a little<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you for volunteering, Lt<br />

**Kolea:** Throk think that is very passive-aggressive insult towards honorable ship pilot from "Counselor".<br />
**Throk:** Throk think that is very passive-aggressive insult towards honorable ship pilot from "Counselor".<br />
*Throk makes "air quotes" when he says, "Counselor".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I like your plan Hailey, but one thing i have learned is that evidence is sometimes completely useless, and only passion mold passions<br />
*Throk wishes Throk was not such a good ventriloquist.*<br />
*Kolea wishes Throk was not such a good ventriloquist.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I am inclined to agree with Zox, I think this is our best option<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We will make it so!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Just need some holograms to give this act a little bit of a surreal quality and we are good to go<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Prepare to beam down an away team to carry out the plan, I will go let the Xepai know to observe <br />
*Cmdr Bachar buries her head in her hands*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Out of curiosity, could we possibly just... interfere with the version of events the Xepai see by manipulating their data feeds to show what we need them to see and then retcon events as necessary to ensure the survival of the Venonans?<br />
**Ishemok:** This is just a degenerate form of salesmanship!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That way when we inevitably botch something, it will not be broadcast live and make us look even worse to the Xepai?<br />
**Ishemok:** But I like the way you are applying practical business and advertising skills to fostering inter-species peace.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** After all, the Xepai are the ones we need to impress as a fellow spacefaring species if we wish to engage and improve the results so Starfleet Command is pleased with the outcome of our first contact situation with them?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We could attempt it, but if we are detected it could jeapordize Starfleet/Xepai relations<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True. Just a suggestion, intercultural things are not what I'm here for.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think they'll definitely discover that charade, sooner rather than later, but definitely later as well. The town's plan is to spread the word of their deities far and wide, so we'd have to address that as well in every town the Xepai monitor<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Fair enough, just putting ideas on the table.<br />
*Kolea is impressed Skig was awake long enough to make a coherent, if flawed, suggestion.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That is a good point, if we trick them and the contamination is allowed to spread, they may end up wiping out even more villages later when they discover<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, then I shall work on making sure we don't mess up and put on the best show possible for the Xepai and the Venonans.<br />
*Skig goes to find all manner of engineering shenanigans to minimise casualties and help out with THIS WEEK'S CRAZY PLAN.*<br />
*Throk begins bench pressing a small starship to get ready for combat.*<br />

**Kolea:** Can I recommend we try this at night, where our superior technology and night-vision makes this easier for us?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** An excellent suggestion!<br />
**Kolea:** I realize gun fight at high-noon is better on video, but we aren't actually trying to get people killed.<br />
**T'Kor:** On the other hand, I do wish to point out that my natural tempreature emits light in the standard visual spectrum of many carbon-based life forms<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Not after holographic correction.<br />
**Throk:** But then audience will miss out on shirtless Zox showing off massive pectoral muscles and making pet lizards among viewers swoon!<br />
**Kolea:** It's okay Throk, we will include in the blooper reel for the Director's Cut edition.<br />
*Throk makes popcorn.*<br />
**Throk:** THROK HAS BEST IDEA EVER!<br />
**Throk:** THROK WANT T'KOR TO WEAR GIANT MARSHMALLOW MAN SUIT AND EXPLODE GOOEY TASTINESS ALL OVER VILLAGE.<br />
**Kolea:** Now that is a lot of merchandising and advertising potential right there.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I agree. That's the most harmless thing anyone could have thought of.<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: Dr. Zerra and T'Kor beam down just outside the Venonan village and walk in to find the locals are now making facimilies of Starfleet uniforms in medical blue, and carrying wooden carvings in the shape of medical tricorders and commbadges. Priestess Pinek is delivering a sermon to a group of Venonan.<br />

**Pinek:** And lo: did The Zerra say unto us: "Take these and you shall feel beter in the morning". And his words were true, and his salve was true, and our faith was true. This is the glorious story of how The Zerra saved our people. We must spread the word of the Zerra to the other villages, so that they may welcome him into their hearts and live in good health and harmony.<br />
**Pinek:** And if they reject his message of health, peace and love: we must rend them limb from limb, and their suffering will serve as a warning to all those who would reject the love of The Zerra. <br />
*Pinek sees Dr. Zerra and T'Kor and drops to her knees*<br />
**Pinek:** It is the heartless one, Nanon! Who long ignored our prayers! The Zerra is here to destroy him, to tear his limbs from his body and bathe in his blood! Rejoice at the death of the false one Nanon!<br />
