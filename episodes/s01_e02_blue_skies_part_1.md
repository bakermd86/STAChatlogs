>Captains log, stardate 61062.5. We were en-route to the Aldiri system to conduct trade negotiations when we received a distress call from a Kelorian colony near the Tzenkethi border.
The colony is experiencing severe malfunctions in their weather control grid, and have requested Federation assistance to repair it.The planet is beset with naturally occurring ion storms, and with the grid offline, the entire colony is in grave danger.
I managed to convince Amondi to let me lead the away team myself. But only if I took Zox with me. Dr. Viraseti and Commander Skig are leading the repair efforts, and Murry and I are coordinating with the colony in case an evacuation is needed. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: Skig and Commander Viraseti are investigating the issues with the weather control emitter. Captain Baras, Zox, and Murry are discussing contingency plans with the colony administrator Anjek.<br />

*Skig is checking to see if they can properly determine when the next Ion Storm will strike so they have a timeframe for bringing repairs online.*<br />
**Anjek:** We simply must find some way to repair the weather control system. Evacuating the colony and abandoning all of our research is not a palatable option for us<br />
**Captain Baras:** I understand that Administrator, but if the grid cannot be repaired in time, it may be the only option <br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Well, looks like yesterday was a good day for an ion storm...<br />
*Skig rotates tricoder 965 degrees to see if maybe the color chart will change.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It's better to have things prepared as a just in case. Hopefully we can treat this as a slightly irregular drill, rather than an actual evacuation. <br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti furrows her brow*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I still can't figure out why the frequency dampeners are not alligning, Commander. It seems like the ionic radiation is causing interference.<br />
*Zox levels his keen and constantly watching eyes on the scene.*<br />

**Anjek:** Fleeing from the planet and leaving hundreds of delicate experiments to be ravaged by the ionic storms hardly sounds like a drill<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** It looks like there is some sort of transient interference from the Migratronic Aviary Transponder.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Can you fix it?<br />
**Skig ***(mutters)*: Given current rolls, we'd be better off calling for Exterminatus.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If you can stablize the power delivery, we may have some hope of getting the emitters back online<br />
*Zox nods at Skig*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** You are correct, if we have to flee it's definitely not a drill anymore. But I'm sure Lieutenant Commanders Skig and Viraseti will wrap this up shortly, barring any unusual circumstances. <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** That is a good option, let me see if I can adjust the relay system to remodulate the capacitance without impacting the Connubial Dampeners.<br />
**Anjek:** You will forgive me if I do not share your confidence, your colleagues do not seem to be able to roll very well<br />
*Skig nods in total agreement to the destruction of the Fourth Wall due to horrific dice rolls.*<br />

![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** If you do not like the weather here, why not just leave the planet?<br />
*Skig rejoices at not getting a complication for the first time today.*<br />
**Anjek:** The ionic storms here are an inconvenience, but they enable our entire research project<br />
**Anjek:** By harnessing the ionic energy with our weather control grid, we are able to study the interactions of complex ionic systems in a way that our scientists have never before been able<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Then should you not pre-emtively evacuate non-essential staff in the event of some catastrophe?<br />
**Zox: [ REASON  (7) +  SECURITY  (4)]

**Anjek:** Your suggestion is... reasonable<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I am glad this planet is reasonable! I will make preparations immediately. <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Viraseti, it seems like there is some sort of variable frequency change impacting the ionic range. Can you check the colony ionic weather patterns and see if this is a new phenomenon or something expected?<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti performs a scan before kneeling down to where Skig is working*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Something unusual.... Try that again Commander, these energy patterns are... not behaving as I would expect<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps you triggered some sort of sympathetic response?<br />
*Hailey Murry turns to Zox*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Can ion storms have sympathy? <br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** No.<br />
*Captain Baras laughs*<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Very well, although my bedside manner talking through the psychological disorders present in weather patterns is limited to merely encouraging rain to not be quite so acidic.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Whatever you ask of them, they just charge extra.<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Commander, picking up increasing ionic radiation<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If you've got any of that last-second magic, now is the time to use it<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** That did not seem to respond as expected, I feel like we are approaching this from the wrong charge.<br />
>As Commander Viraseti speaks, an Ionic storm front begins to form in the distance<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** So what sorts of things do you work on here, Administrator? <br />
**Skig: Skig has used a point of Determination to add a natural one to the dice pool.**<br />

Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 23]**<br />
**Anjek:** We study the effects of ionic energy on biological systems. My own research is on using ionic radiation to treat neurological disorders<br />
*Skig stands up, does the "Picard Maneuver" to pull down her shirt. Glares crossly at the control relay, takes a deep breath, and smashes her fist into solid metal panel just below the buttons.*<br />
*Skig then kicks the side of the control panel after choosing what looks like a suitable location for her irritation.*<br />
*Skig inhales deeply.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Whatever you did Commander, it seems to be working. The interferometric emmiters are coming back online.<br />
*Hailey Murry applauds from the side*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** See? I told you things would be fine. <br />
*Zox nods enthusiastically at the application of force.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Proper application of the principle of force times motivation equals desired results.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They're still having trouble locking on to the frequency of the storm. The frequency is shifting too rapidly for the emitters to compensate<br />
>The storm front in the distance suddenly begins to roll rapidly across the sands, towards the colony<br />

>Within a matter of seconds, the storm slams into the perimitter of the weather control emitters, surrounding the colony<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The emitters are holding for now, but I don't know how long that will last<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Is this a new occurence though?  Something must have happened to precipitate this change.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Agreed, this happened far too suddenly<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Might there be some place underground to seek shelter against this?<br />
**Anjek:** Our facility is built into the cliff face, but the geology here offers little protection against ionic radiation <br />
**Anjek:** That is why we need the weather grid<br />
*Skig checks the system logs for the normal behavior of the ion storms versus what was just observed to determine if this effect has been getting worse over time or if there is some sort of system malfunction that is causing the issue.*<br />

**Captain Baras:** Commanders, if you can't find a way to repair the grid, I will have to order the evacuation. We can't risk losing the entire away team<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Yes.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** When did the troubles with the weather grid begin? <br />
*Skig appreciates Hailey asking the important questions.*<br />
**Anjek:** We have had challenges with the grid since the first day<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** But there are no reports of ion storms of this intensity before your expedition set up shop?<br />
**Anjek:** No matter how much power we pump into the grid, the storms seem to be capable of overpowering it<br />
**Anjek:** Surveys prior to our arrival indicated mild ionic activity<br />

[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Perhaps the storms are merely reacting to the increases in power by being drawn to the weather control grid in an escalating fashion.<br />

[Successes: 1] [Complications: 1]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 34]**<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It would certainly explain the reaction when you powered on the grid<br />
**Captain Baras:** So what do you suggest commander? We can't shut down the grid in the midst of this storm<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** What's being used to generate power for the grid? <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** The frequencies are modulating rapidly too try and overcome the defenses and the storm intensity is increasing. It may almost be fruitful to evacuate the planet, turn off the weather control grid, then turn it back on at a much lower power and judge the response of the ionic storm.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Agreed Commander. The situation has gotten out of hand. I'm ordering an evactuation. Baras to Lister, initiate emergency transport.<br />
>There is no response to the captain's order, and no transports take place.<br />

**Captain Baras:** Baras to Lister, respond.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I think that request has come a minute too late, Captain. <br />
*Skig really doesn't want to mention the hamster wheels in the control panel responsible for the weather control system, since that would make Hailey sad.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** There's nothing but static on the line<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The storm must be blocking communications<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** There was a 99.99999999% chance of that being the case.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Suggestions?<br />
*Skig checks Plot-Meter to verify accuracy of her statement.*<br />
*Captain Baras turns to the away team*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Project and ionic field of our own to shield ourselves?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If we take the power banks from our phasers and feed them into the grid, we may be able to generate a single pulse to dissipate the storm<br />
*Zox Nods approvingly*<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I would be concerned about the sudden influx of power overloading the relays given the problem we have been having with them, if we can compensate for that it would be a feasible thing to try.<br />

*Skig thinks today was not worth getting out of bed, and she should have used one of her 4,000 banked "sick days".*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Ok, Murry gather everyone around the emitter. Zox, set up the shield emitter and stand by<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Will this cover the entire population of the colony?<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Well, hopefully pre-evactuation orders were actually obeyed<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** But we can only hope so.<br />
**Anjek:** We'll have to gather everyone here in the courtyard, but we only have a hundred or so researchers. We should be able to fit, though it may be a bit tight<br />
*Skig checks the dice rolls for the day, suspects everyone who was pre-evacuated is trapped in the transporter buffer and having a stream of ice cream based positrons shoved through their system and when they rematerialize they will look like Olaf from Frozen.*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Ok, Zox activate the shield<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I'm pretty sure you should lick those ends to make the electrons flow faster through the spacing gap in the cladding.<br />
>Zox dives into the panel, rapidly rewiring the emitter circuits to collapse the broad-spectrum weather grid into a small sheild emitter centered on the away team<br />

>As the grid retracts, the storm collapses in with it, until the away team is surrounded by the raging ionic storm mere meters away<br />

*Skig begins feverishly working on an unconnected piece of equipment to help, thankfully everyone is polite and does not point out the console is powered down.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The emitter seems to be holding, power levels are stable<br />
*Zox briefly considers Skigs idea, but determines it is her yet again un-used sick day and the advice may not be the best.*<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The ionic radiation seems to be... affecting our cognition<br />

*Hailey Murry pauses before taking a sip of her coffee*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** What is it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Those four side panels should have scoring on them from when the forward lounge was opened to vacuum during the Battle of Betazad.  I insisted the scoring from the plasma marks not get removed during the refit.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** We had been using the forward lounge as emergency triage for injured and thirty four crew we blown into space when the torpedo struck.<br />

*Skig takes the bottle of Romulan Ale generously.*<br />
**Chief Botok:** That doesn't sound like the Skig I know<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Thank you Tural, I will cherish this as I cherish your friendship and kindness.<br />
**Chief Botok:** Where's that detatched Tellerite aggression?<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 18]**<br />
*Skig remembers putting the bottle with Tural's casket before his remains were launched into space.*<br />
*Skig looks at Chief Botok.*<br />
>An older Bolian man comes up from behind and shakes Skig's hand<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Botok!<br />
*Skig shakes his hand.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** It is a pleasure to see you again. I believe it is my turn in our 3D chess game. Knight to A-4-9.<br />
**Chief Botok:** I knew you'd eventually find your way to a starship Skig, from the first day of my "Applied Warp Field Dynamics" class<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  COMMAND  (3)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 29]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Ah yes, the day you pointed out, after arguing with me for thirty minutes, that my entire theory was flawed due to an inverted sign on the flow theory algorithm I was using.<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ INSIGHT  (12) +  CONN  (3)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]

![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Captain, may I suggest mass-hallucination as the most likely explanation for this phenomenon. Perhaps the ionic storms are somehow inter-weaving our collective unconsciouness.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** This is not just a mass hallucination <br />
**Captain Baras:** So we could be in Skig's mind? Having some sort of vivid hallucination?<br />
*Hailey Murry picks up her coffee and takes a sip*<br />
*Skig is still talking to Botok.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We're all sharing dreams, I think<br />
**Chief Botok:** Your colleagues here told me they figure out your birthday. I suspect they may have violated some protocols accessing your personel records! But when they invited me, I knew I had to come<br />
**Chief Botok:** I wanted to see what you're doing out here with this old war horse!<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** It could be that Skig had the most powerful mind and thus most powerful base electric activity.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti scoffs at Zox's suggestion*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** She's also the first to fall asleep as well<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I have a fondness for old ships and the history they bring, as well you know.<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  ENGINEERING  (3)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 10]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** They have personalities and quirks, much like the crew that inhabit them.<br />
>Zox runs out of the corner and kicks the chair out from under Tural. Tural falls on his ass and looks at Zox<br />

*Skig blinks.*<br />
*Zox Toots a loud WAR whistle before his scales turn bright red.*<br />
**Skig ***(mutters)*: I do not remember this happening on THAT day.<br />
**Tural:** Ensign Pedersen? Is this further exploration of the value of surprise in acquiring wisdom?<br />
**Tural:** If so, I am very surprised by your actions. But they are not at all logical<br />
*Tural stands back up and dusts himself off*<br />
**Hailey Murry ***(mutters)*: They are highly logical once you have the right point of view<br />
*Skig realizes it is hard to focus on both past and present at the same time.*<br />
*Ensign Marks and Lt. Howard laugh at Tural and Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I wonder why we're being shown this, specifically<br />
**Lt. Howard:** Now that's getting into the spirit of a party<br />
*Hailey Murry pays close attention to the events of the scene, for future reference*<br />
>As everyone is pondering Zox's actions, the red alart klaxon blares<br />

**Skig ***(mutters)*: Now that is expected.<br />
>A Galor Class Cardassian cruiser appears in the distance, visible through the forward observation windows<br />

*Skig sighs.*<br />
>♫♫♫Spoooooky Music Sting♫♫♫<br />

**Skig ***(mutters)*: It would be nice to know if the past can be changed, but I have the feeling this is not the opportunity I think it is.<br />
