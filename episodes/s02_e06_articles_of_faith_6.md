>INTERIOR - Bridge: The Cardassian captain smiles at the crew from the viewscreen as Malat clenches her hands into tight fists behind the tactical console. Captain Bachar rises from her chair and takes a few steps towards the viewscreen.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The Xepai would rule this pretty much exactly on the strict interpretation of the text of the agreement. They aren't a spiritual people. <br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): It would be funny if there was some sort of Vulcan/Romulan split among the Jem'Hadar where the angry ones and peaceful ones don different names/ways.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think that the Jem'Hadar colony Windbloom came from would be more likely to give it to the Cardassians by default, but I think we could probably convince them otherwise to get the Orb to the Bajorans. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** T'Pau would probably wind up being the mediator, who's also not going to be swayed emotionally. I get the feeling he'd be more of a "rules as intended" fellow, rather than "rules as written"<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think the orb is definitely a legitimate salvage interest under the terms of Appendix J, because by Appendix P the Cardassians have agreed that the orbs are the righul property of Bajor, and are important spiritual artifacts to them. This means that we are required to settle a dispute with a third-party mediator. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** A third party both sides have to agree to, so who do we pick?<br />

>Zox pulls up the sensors but there is a lot of interference from the plasma storms. To try to cut through, he routes warp power directly to the forward sensor array. Unfortunately, moments later an alarm klaxon sounds as his power reroute overloads the Flyer's engines.<br />

>The shuttle begins to list forward, as it falls into the gravity well of the small rocky body which it was approaching.<br />

I probably wouldn't have done that, but I usually follow the standard operating procedures.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I mean, generally I avoid hooking up EPS conduits to a person's pacemaker, but that is what Zox has basically done.<br />

>Zox rips open the panel and tears of his shirt, then crawls behind an access panel and conducts the fastest EPS bypass he has ever performed. The engines surge back to life, and Ensign Ghex rushes back to the panel to safely land the flyer. However, as she does so, the panel overloads directly into her face, sending her flying across the cockpit<br />

>When he arrives at the door to the larger of the three chambers, he finds the door control is still powered and functional. When the door opens, he sees his sister's kitchen, or at least a 1-to-1 recreation of it. At the counter, a man in a starfleet uniform and an apron is chopping some carrots<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Wait....what?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** I should probably ask why the fire detection system alerted me to a fire in the hall, but I suspect I don't want to know the answer<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Aren't you above work like this?<br />
*Geret aggressive honk*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** It's a funny thing really, I never ate anything but replicated food my entire life. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** But when you killed your sister, the strangest thing happened. It must be a side effect of the link, and possibly my Betazoid side, but I picked up some skills and memories as her body died with me inside it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** Suddenly, I know how to cook, and I can remember the taste of fresh produce. After a lifetime of eating replicated meals, now I suddenly yearn for the flavor of a real vegetable. I'm sure you can relate<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Convincing emotional story, but the only way to know if it is true is to taste whatever you are preparing.<br />
*Kolea is somewhat happy Ghex is unconscious in the other room, given the context and her involvement in it.*<br />
*Lt. Haggarty adds the carrots to the salad bowl next to him, and then grabs a vinaigrette and begins to toss the vegetables in it*<br />

*Lt. Haggarty plates a portion of salad from the bowl onto a plate and slides it across the table towards Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Okay, so I do believe you....but why exactly where you quantum controling or entangled like this?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** Good question, why don't we sit down and I explain my entire plan to you.<br />
>Watches as zox rips a metal leg off of a table, revealing that there is a holographic cosmetic surface being projected over the table.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** The holograms were for your sister's benefit, we stocked the room with real food items because should would have been able to tell by taste if we used replicated food<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** But the walls, ornamentation, work surfaces... recreating the room as a hologram and projecting over unaddorned surfaces was the simplest approach.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** I am actually a little big annoyed that you killed her, I worked very hard writing a 3-day long story to keep her occupied in here while I was using her body<br />

>Zox fires a net launcher that (for some inexplicable reason) Skig included in the suit. As the net wraps around Lt. Haggarty, he suddenly phases out of existence, dropping the knife he was holding to the floor as he does so. Then reappears a few meters away.<br />

*Lt. Haggarty points to the walls.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** Holo-emitters, you didn't think I would just waltz in here and hope for the best, did you?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** I like the old-school thinking, very retro with the net launcher<br />
*Kolea makes another cup of tea for Viraseti and marks a checkbox in the "Haggarty" column.*<br />

*Lt. Haggarty pulls a book out from a drawer on the counter and slides it across the table to Zox.*<br />

>Zox picks up the book. It is an old paperbound novel from Earth, the cover reads "The Wind's Twelve Quarters." A red bookmark has been placed midway through the book, stickint out at the top.<br />

*Zox glares at the hologram before arranging a transport out.*<br />
*Lt. Haggarty laughs ominously as Zox beams out.*<br />
