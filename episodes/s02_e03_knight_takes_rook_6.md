>INTERIOR - Walk-In Freezer: Throk and Zox look over Kagon's shoulder at Rhuk, frozen nearly solid, hanging from a meat hook by a harness looped under her armpits. She sways gently side to side, bumping into the other slabs of frozen Paraceratherium and Megatherium meat.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I think that the trebuchet would be bad, because she would smash through the windows and that would let out all the warm air. Greenhouses don't work to stay warm if you smash big holes in their roof, because all the heat will get out through convection.<br />
