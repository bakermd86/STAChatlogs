>EXTERIOR - Casino parking lot: Murry crawls out of the capsized ice cream van, her ears still ringing from Skig's wildly oversized explosion. The away team pick themselves up from the pavement, and wipe away the chunky marinara that used to be the casino pit boss. Raimondo Garbo retreats into the hotel as a bunch of mobsters start pulling weapons.<br />

>As Raimondo's goons go to pull out their pieces and open fire, they instead find sticks of spaghetti, cartons of canneloni, packs of penne, and other forms of pasta<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** Pasta Spaghetti!<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I must not care about irrelevant Holodeck characters. They are nothing. Even caring about them is the mind-killer. For the Holodeck is the invention of humans who need LARP-time. It is the time wasting event that brings total obliteration. I will ignore their existence. Their weapons meant nothing, they will pass through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. When the simulation ends, there will be nothing. Only I will remain.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux): 5th wall credit</font><br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Ok, while Throk is buying time we need to get this van out of here<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** Noo! Brother Throk! You need to teach me the weirding way!<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Is anyone else concerned by the fact that Throk is running into a horde of mooks while paraphrasing Frank Herbert? I mean, I thought I broke the 5th wall from time to time with product placements, but that is pretty crazy.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Less talking, more running.<br />
**Ishemok:** He should have captured and ransomed their leader in the dead of night, in the shadow of Shai-Hulud<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** Extinction is not an option! Aaaaaargh!<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** We need to get this thing back on its wheels<br />

*Skig looks at Bachar.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, since this is an ice cream truck that typically works at the Las Vegas aquarium, you will note that it has a pneumatic float system so it can drive into the water and sell ice cream to kids in the dolphin petting pool. Just push that big yellow button and it should right itself when the floats self-inflate.<br />
>Murry hits the button as indicated, and the van flips back up onto its wheels<br />

**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I love to hug dolphins while wearing my bikini! It is amazing how often it just flies right off though. I suspect it might be undersized.<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Let's unpack that later and get out of here while these guys are distracted<br />

**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Wait, I have an idea!<br />
>The driver of the pursuing vehicle goes for his windshield wiper stalk, but this is an american car from the 1970s, so the stalk falls off in his hands, and then the car rolls over, crashes into a big pile of cardboard boxes that are sitting on the side of the road for no obvious reason, and explodes<br />

>[TURN] Hadija Zawadi<br />

**Ishemok:** Wooo! Yeah!<br />
**Ishemok:** THat's what you get when you buy a car from Sam Mulloy!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That must have been a pursuing Ford Pinto.<br />
**Kosal Oram:** I had no idea this frozen dessert was such a powerful weapon<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Hailey, pull us on to the off-ramp of the interstate and begin driving headlong into oncoming traffic. It is a necessary trope!<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** This is basically a game, so it'll obviously reward such cheesy thinking!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, give me a minute and I'll invert the regulator on the fuel intakes to turbocharge the intakes and basically convert this ice cream truck into a small jet engine.<br />

*Tracy Dixon, P.I. pulls onto the wrong ramp, whipping up onto the the road. For good measure, she flips the ice cream music on to increase their van's availability*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Ishemok): Go for broke!</font><br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) tears off her top and gets on top of the ice cream truck and begins waving at people, distracting all the oncoming traffic and causing a huge number of skidding accidents and slamming brakes.*<br />
>One the mobsters is unable to keep up with Murry's suicidal pace through the oncoming traffic, but the other is driving like a man possessed, and stays with her through the traffic<br />

>[TURN] Mobster Sedan 2<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk now realize, much like Original Series, where goal of many episodes is removal of Kirk's shirt, our primary goal is removal of Kolea's clothes.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I don't suppose any of the machinery in the ice cream coolers is easy to turn into explosives, is it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Sure! And it will lighten the vehicle and allow it to travel faster.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** All we need to do is just rewire the electrical feed and create refrigerated time bombs.<br />

>He begins to reload another rocket<br />

>[TURN] Huey Helicopter<br />

>[ROUND 2]<br />

**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** All we have to do is start flinging the ice cream refigeration units in front of the oncoming cars as the rocket fires, then they will pirouette through the air and intercept the rocket for us.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I've seen this in movies.<br />
>[TURN] Tracy Dixon, P.I.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or we could just have Kosal toss the metal canister at the rocket if it is going to fly towards us.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** My idea is more cinematically appropriate.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I refuse to argue that point.<br />

**Ishemok:** Whew.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Well that was unexpected<br />
*Hadija Zawadi checks her watch as Murry drives the van back to the shop*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Good timing though, our briefing is in 10 minutes<br />
*Pennington (T'kor) salutes his strange fallen comrade*<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** This has been the best holodeck experience in my life!<br />
*Skig makes a mental note to not ask about Kolea's other holodeck experiences, ever.*<br />
*Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux looks at how many subs and followers "Bubbles" has gotten..*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Now that we are out of danger, it should be a simple matter of carrying the bags out through the archway<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The decoding algorithm in the program should transfer them onto replicated PADDs as we exit<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hopefully.<br />
>As the away team exits the holodeck, a set of PADDs materialize in their hands<br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** Ok, you can start taking a look but we have a briefing in 8 minutes<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** and I expect you all to be in your uniforms<br />
*Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux groans on the now featureless floor of the holodeck*<br />
*Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux heads to Dr. Zerra's room*<br />
*Zox extends a bro-fist to Throk as we were the meanest green thing to hit the streets of the 1970s.*<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) leaves the holodeck wearing only strategically placed globs of whipped cream.*<br />
*Throk gives Zox return fist-bump, forgets he has lethal claws and inflicts a grievous injury, allowing Zox to go to medical for cause.*<br />
*Skig goes to get dressed, does not forget to write up the Twins for their sabotage of the PES conduit.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Briefing room: The senior staff filter in to the briefing room to find the captain waiting at the head of the table<br />

*Zox acts professional, befitting of a Starfleet Officer.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Thanks for joining, I wish I knew what this briefing was about, but I'm as in the dark as all of you<br />
*Skig shows up early, in proper attire, according to Starfleet regulations.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I was instructed to head for Sector 017  to rendezvous, and be prepared for fleet operation<br />

*Skig enters the passcode displayed on the screen which reads, "If you are Romulan, please do not use this code to gain access to Starfleet Secret Briefings."*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I love these pre-meetings you can just get coffee.<br />
>As the briefing starts, an older Human woman appears on the viewscreen, flanked by a slightly younger Human man standing beside her<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** mutters to himself 'diplomacy failed again eh?'<br />
**Admiral Nechayev:** Good afternoon everyone, I will keep this as brief as possible. By now, you are probably wondering what war we are suddenly fighting again. Let me put you at ease: we are not embarking on another conflict<br />
*Zox takes out a notebook and puts a hash mark in the 'Diplomacy has succeeded' side.*<br />
**Admiral Nechayev:** Our mission today concerns a threat to all life on Earth, a secret that Starfleet has kept for the past 115 years. <br />
**Admiral Nechayev:** In the mid 23rd century, Federation scientists were studying the collapse of a binary pulsar system when they detected a massive gamma ray burst from the in-falling stellar material. After plotting its course, they found it was going to hit Earth in 140 years, about 25 years from now.<br />
*Skig refrains from asking if eliminating all life on Earth is a good thing or a bad thing.*<br />
**Admiral Nechayev:** It took more than a century to work out a viable defense plan for Earth, but our scientists and engineers eventually came up with a plan: a bulwark of starships, with specifically calibrated shield harmonics, at a sufficient distance from the Earth, should redirect enough of the radiation away from the planet to avoid any fatal consequences<br />
*Skig checks her retirement date and decides this is not a problem for her.*<br />
*Skig would like to know where the radiation is going to be redirected TO.*<br />
*Zox thinks humans should get thicker scales*<br />
**Admiral Nechayev:** You will find more details on fleet formations, shield harmonics, and radiation protocol in your briefing packets. But if you all do your jobs, and things go as planned, this mission should take less than a week and you will all have the satisfaction of knowing that you helped save all life on Earth<br />
**Admiral Nechayev:** I'll leave you to your preparations, we need to be in position and ready to go in 12 hours. Dimissed.<br />
*Skig is not sold that improves her sense of job satisfaction if the Lister is put in danger.*<br />
>The viewer switches off as the briefing is terminated<br />

*Skig flinches as Bachar hits her for guessing what Skig is thinking.*<br />
*Skig begins reviewing the modifications to shield harmonics necessary to achieve the requested goal.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Skig: to answer your first question: No it is not optional to chose to sacrifice all life on Earth to avoid putting the Lister in danger<br />
*Skig cancels T'Kor's vacation.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What? I didn't ask that.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Don't pretend like you weren't going to<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** According to the radiation protocol, we need to offload any non-essential crew<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. leans in toward Bachar and quietly says, "This could be incredibly bad for Star Fleet if anybody sabotages this mission"*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nonsense, I have reformed, I would not have asked that question. Thought it? Yes, but I have learned not to ask questions like that.<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. test*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Looks like they are using troop transports to take any non-essential personel back to Earth for the duration<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Commander Bachar, review the duty rosters and make a recommendation for who will remain aboard, I will prepare a briefing for the crew<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Aye sir<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So we need to offload uncessary crew, get into position, adjust shield harmonics, and basically create a giant deflector array.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I need to get to sickbay to start replicating radiation meds, the radiation exposure is going to be high for any crew that remains aboard<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That is an efficient summary of the plan Commander Skig<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I do not see where this radiation is being deflected to. I assume this is not being punted into a direction that some foreign power would consider it an act of war or we melt a planet of natives in violation of the Prime Directive.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Viraseti, I want you to get down to stellar cartography and re-run these numbers, make sure this is going to be a survivable level of gamma radiation for the Lister<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes ma'am<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns to Skig*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well at distances beyond 500 light years, the radiation would be too attenuated to be of any real danger<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The only reason the risk is so great to Earth is because of its proximity<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It is too bad it isn't hitting some uninhabited planet instead, imagine what a great research opportunity it would be to observe the effect of such a large GRB on a planet!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would prefer we channel the forward sensor array to create an arc at a distance about 25% greater than what Starfleet is recommending due to the differences in the xenotronium alloy used in ships of this era.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti saunters off thrilled at the prospect of studying such a powerfull GRB*<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Hey! We might be the worst ship in Star Fleet physically, and we might be the worst ship in Star Fleet in terms of staff history, but we have the ship with the most heart &lt;3</font><br />
