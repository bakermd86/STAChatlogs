>Captains log, Stardate 61554.4. Due to delays in the Lister's repairs, our planetary survey of the Taratan Theta system is very far behind schedule. We are using our main sensor array to conduct the stellar survey and catalogue the innermost planets, but we have had to deploy shuttlecraft to perform orbital surveys of the system's other primary satellites.

To help get back on schedule, I even approved Skig's request to utilize Old Faithless. She insists it is "spaceworthy" and "not a deathtrap." Regardless, I ordered her to lead the survey team using it, just in case she was overstating its level of readiness. We expect all shuttlecraft to complete their surveys and return no later than 2100 hours tomorrow. Assuming we are able to keep to that schedule, we should be back on track for our rendezvous with the USS Kinshasa.<br />

>INTERIOR - Ol' Faithless: Skig and her team are in orbit of a large T-Type gas giant in the outer planetary system. The crew are attempting to complete the survey of the planet and its seven moons. Ensign T'Kor is conducting the meteorilogical survey of the gas giant, while Dr. Zerra is conducting the biological survey of the orbital moons, and Lt. Commander Viraseti conducts the geological survey.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, have you locked down the crossfeed bifbulating deatomizer to the Herman flux regulator?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You know Commander, when you say things like that, for some reason I start to worry about the space-worthiness of this shuttle<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless is entirely reliable, I just wanted to make sure we detached the still from the warp drive cooling system. Last time we forgot that the shipboard computer became shit-faced if we spent more than 30 minutes above Warp 3.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I would advise against drinking anything created in this vessel.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** On medical and sanitary grounds<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The replicator does occasionally puke chunks of rust, probably should figure that out at some point.<br />
**T'Kor:** It has been locked down with a 75% confidence, but 22% of the nonconfidence is covered by the plan B backup where we re-purpose the power to the shuttle's left positioning thrusters to reapplicate the secondary fecundian array<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The remaining 3% being Plan C where we have to throw in enough plant based matter to the anti-matter drive that we break the time-space continuum? That's better than last time. Good job with those upgrades.<br />
**T'Kor:** I've got plenty of experience piloting Old Faithless, so don't be worried!<br />
**T'Kor:** At least, I do if you count the flights within the shuttle bay<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ensign T'Kor, the third moon appears to be class-M, I'm reading a lot of bio signs there. Could you move us into a low orbit so I can conduct the bio survey?<br />
**T'Kor:** Of course, Doctor<br />

*Skig wheels out one of those filthy looking oil change trolleys, lies down on it, and slides underneath the main computer system, which has random sparks flying from it and a small arc of lightning between two screws that Skig insists "ABSOLUTELY no one touch that or the shuttle will lose power".*<br />
>The shuttle suddenly lurches forward as power cuts out. The interior lights switch to their emergency setting, artificial gravity cuts out, and the shuttle begins tumbling through space, falling in towards the moon.<br />

*T'Kor glows to compensate*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...did anyone touch that arc of lightning that I said NOT to touch?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I don't smell burning flesh.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am afraid to touch my seat<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Your seat is grounded, it should be fine. If I asked you to sit in the blue chair that is a different story.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, did you remember to put fuel in the fusion reactor before we launched. I told you to fill the tank, not put in just 0.005 Latinum worth.<br />
**T'Kor:** No need to be worried. At least not for about 7min, at which point we should start being fairly worried. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless, set an alarm for 6 minutes and 30 seconds from now to remind me to send out the updates to the last will and testaments of everyone on the shuttle.<br />
**T'Kor:** I did, I used the fuel canisters that were sitting next to Shuttle Beta<br />
**Computer Voice:** Do it yourself<br />
**T'Kor:** I've got it<br />
*T'Kor sets an old egg timer to 6min 30s*<br />
**Computer Voice:** Thanks honey<br />
**Geret:** Ooh Ooh! Can we use the transporters to sponge up dillute hydrogen and helium isotopes from the surrounding space to shore up the fuel supply temporarily!??!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... did we bring any spare, it looks like we hit a dampening field and the engine compensator churned through all the fuel in the system.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless, set snarkiness value to 95 or current, whatever is higher.<br />
**Geret:** OOh ooh! Panel 3b.1 indicates our power is being drained from coordinates 340-209; moon 13 of that planet!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good thinking Ensign Geret, I'm reading a small amount of deuterium in a lagrange point within transporter range. But the transporters have no power to beam it aboard<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If Skig can get enough power for a single transport, it might be enough deuterium to power the engines for a few moments<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What...why...is there deuterium free floating at a lagrange point?<br />
**T'Kor:** 5 minutes remaining<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Because the dice are kind today<br />
**Geret:** There's no shortage of hot air in the universe. that's why. =D<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Right, anyway, activating the transporter.<br />

**Geret:** Please?!<br />
*T'Kor gives a long series of clicks and squeals, which translate into a sigh*<br />
**T'Kor:** Yes, though I was looking forward to it. Please do not damage the casing. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** What does he eat? How could it possibly have enough energy to power the transporter?<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't worry T'Kor, the Toy in the Kid's Meal is inert and cannot be used for this purpose.<br />
>Somehow Geret's insane plan works, T'Kor's lunch contains just enough chemical energy that she is able to power the emergency transporter and beam a small amount of deuterium into the shuttle's reactor<br />

**Geret:** WHoo hoo!! Im so glad Starfleet(TM) academy prepared me for a real mission!<br />
>The viewscreen now begins to glow orange as the shuttle falls deeper and deeper into the moon's atmosphere<br />

*Skig sighs and puts the backup generator she stores in the closet inside the Faraday Cage for just this purpose...back into the closet.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Based on my calculations, that amount of deurium will only power the engines for 3.2 seconds<br />
**Geret:** Yep, then we are definetly out of gas.<br />
**T'Kor:** I have a drone prepared to release distress signals!<br />
*T'Kor is eager to use his custom-made drone*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, send a distress signal with information concerning the dampening field and our current situation and expected landing location. Then take us in on a glide path to safely land.<br />
**T'Kor:** Yes, sir! <br />

*T'Kor skitters over to the other side of the shuttle, picking up what apperas to be a metal box on one of the counters. It has two slits in the top, maybe an inch wide and a few inches long. *<br />
**T'Kor:** I haven't gotten the thrusters working yet, but it should still emit successfully. It's even got some good anti-espionage defense to it!<br />

**T'Kor:** Make sure you use the tube on the front of the ship, they send out in opposite directions than expected<br />
**T'Kor:** I set up a launch chute along the bottom of the ship, maximum length for maximum velocity. Not a lot in the grand scheme of things, but enough to get it away from the shuttle. <br />
>As the shuttle falls through the atmosphere, engulfed in the re-entry flames, T'Kor keeps the engines powered down until the last moments. As they emerge from the clouds, Skig spots a safe landing patch in a clearing in the trees, and T'Kor just manages to slow the descent enough to put the shuttle down in (more of less) on piece. The landing is still rough, with the crew tossed from their seats. But thankfully, no one is injured.<br />

**Geret:** Wheee! I love away missions!<br />
**T'Kor:** Whew! We'll have to recollect the landing pads along the landing route, there should be 4 sets judging from the bounces we took there. <br />
>As the chaos of the crash-landing subsides, the crew look out the windows to find themselves in a field of burning chunks of debris, in a shallow crater. Outside it is dark, and the smoke from the burning electrical components is blocking the view of the night sky.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You should probably make sure the planet has a survivable atmosphere.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's a good thing we have Viraseti and Zerra with us to assist with an evaluation of the current state of things.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Geret, can you retrieve all the emergency survival kits to establish a base camp once we know what the status of things are.<br />
**Geret:** Yes Ma'am!<br />
*Geret gives a hearty salute.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The atmosphere seems to be a more-or-less safe mix of Oxygen, Nitrogen, carboniferous compounds...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless just needs the nacelle reattached and we should be able to use up 95% of the duct tape in closet C to get it spaceworthy again... however, we are completely out of deuterium and antimatter. Whatever was in the dampening field we crossed wiped out our reserves.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Radiation levels are slightly elevated, but nothing dangerous<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I hope the Lister does not hit the same thing.<br />
**T'Kor:** The duct tape in closet C or closet c? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Hopefully the Lister gets our distress call and has the sense to stay out of range of whatever hit us<br />
*Geret leaps of of Old Faithless and scouts the crash site perimiter. *<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, we can only hope commander. After taking a look at the local area from a science standpoint, can you review the logs and see what you can discern about the dampening field and what our options may be to mitigate it if we have to pass back through it?<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** For better or worse, Zerra, we have some time to work on that.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It seems unlikely that it could have been naturally occurring, it was not present on sensors before we entered low orbit<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Natural phenomenon do not generally turn on and off when you approach<br />
**Geret:** Huh? Those weren't _real_ wolves?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** What? No the dampening field ensign<br />
**Geret:** interesting<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Of course the animals are natural phenomenon<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pats Geret on the head like you would a small child*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I assume you already have an elaborate plan to repair the shuttle and get out of here Commander?<br />
*T'Kor checks the beast to see if it's still alive*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Repair the shuttle? Yes. Find fuel and get out of here? Not yet.<br />

**T'Kor:** Is there a way of telling if this is a wild beast or a not-wild beast?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zerra, can you check these stunned creatures and see if they are sentient and we have just violated the Prime Directive, shot someone's dog, or these are just wild beasts?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Aye ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thank you doctor.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, I will need your help getting Old Faithless functional. Go grab the blow torches and the duct tape.<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** No sign of domestication, but there is an old, healed injury on its hind quarter. I'm reading some sort of worked metal embedded in its flesh. An arrowhead perhaps? I believe ancient humans used something similar at one point.<br />
**Geret:** Very strange!<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): My God, It has an Arrow in its ass! (I'm imagining the seen from the first Shrek movie.)</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, so we may have primitives around here, who undoubtedly saw the fiery descent of our God Chariot.<br />
**Geret:** Can we be polite, and project a holo-field around the ship so they don't investigate?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or they are the remnants of a super advanced race that collapsed on itself, but meh, depends on which trope they pulled out of the hat this week.<br />
**T'Kor:** No, no, this is Old Faithless. God Chariot was decomissioned<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti frowns and looks at her tricorder*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not a bad idea Ensign Geret, but I think you may be too late.<br />
**Geret:** But but...I don't want to hurt innocents!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'm reading 2 humanoid life-forms.. No wait, this can't be right, I'm reading them 4 meters away<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Did we call that "decommissioned" on the official register? I seem to remember that one being used as a slingshot into the bridge of a Jem'Hadar Battlecruiser.<br />

>T'Kor sees nothing in any direction, but then looks up into the trees and sees two humanoid shapes squatting on thick branches in a nearby stand of trees<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nice brachiation.<br />
>When T'Kor looks up at the shapes, one of them suddenly moves. <br />

>A loud *snap* is heard, and then a broken branch falls from the tree with a young man beside it, they land on the ground with a loud thud<br />

>The young-looking man is a little more than 2 meters tall, with pale purple skin. He is wearing a simple tunic of animal skin and fur, and holding a short bow<br />

**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** I am sorry Nanon, please have mercy on my apprentice. He meant no disrepect to you or your servants<br />
>A second alien, older and stouter than the first leaps down from the tree and kneels before T'Kor<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: The younger of the two alien men runs off into the darkness, while the older man remains kneeling in front of T'Kor. He puts away his knife now that "Nanon" has told him he doesn't need to sacrifice himself for his intrusion.<br />

**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Saset, run back to the village, tell Piney that Nanon has returned. The Keepers of the Flame have not forsaken us<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Our prayers have been answered at long last<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man turns back to T'Kor*<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Nanon, we never lost hope that you would return to lift the blight <br />
*Geret looks in awe and for orders from her new captain, Nanon.*<br />
**T'Kor:** Tell us more about the current situation. <br />
*Geret is dissapointed that a god uses such boring, pedestrian, and laconic words.*<br />
*Skig ticks off list of, "Yes sir, these are all the ways we violated the Prime Directive" checklist.*<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** We have remained faithful even in the face of the blight, Shaper Nanon. Myself and Saset are still free of blight, but most of the village is now blighted<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Pinek is better suited to speak to a Shaper though, I am just a hunter....<br />
*T'Kor adjusts his universal translator*<br />
**T'Kor ** *(for Star Fleet only)*: This blight sounds like an illness. It also sounds like another civilization has visited here before. It is unlikely, though possible, that it would be other Tholians, given how far away we are from my home system. Do we know of any previous explorations?<br />
*Skig suspects that this is a situation where Kolea would have been an ideal crew member on this trip.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There was no survey data in the astrometrics database, but until recently this system was in Cardassian space<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): Obviously Zox, Throk, and T'kor would have been ideal</font><br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): Imagine Ishemok here</font><br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It's only opened up to Starfleet exploration since they contracted their borders after the war<br />
*Dr. Zerra discreetly scans the man with his tricorder*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'm not reading any signs of infectious disease, but there is some minor cellular degeneration <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(for Starfleet only)*: Let us not jump to suppositions here concerning whether they have been recently visited by another spacefaring society. We need to be very cautious about our interactions.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Agreed, even if they have been visited by another warp civilization, the prime directive is still in effect<br />
**Geret: [ CONTROL  (10) +  SCIENCE  (3)]

**T'Kor:** What should we do if there is some sort of higher technology that has been left here? Is it appropriate to remove it? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, find out when the "Keepers of the Flame" last visited and how they visited?<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously to the hunter)*: How long ago were you last visited?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Rule of Non-Interference would apply unless we can determine that the higher technology caused a disruption in their natural development. If the "Keepers of the Flame" introduced the blight that is endangering this society, removing it and letting them return to their normal, albeit now altered, evolution would be the appropriate course of action, from my understanding.<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** I am not sure, I am so sorry Shaper Nanon. Pinek would know when it last was. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** But then, I am 100% the last pick for any first contact situation, something about an Insight below 7...although, this would be our second first contact situation this season...<br />
**Geret:** Have you seen the radiation spike eminating from coordianates 12.34? Perhaps this blight is just exposure?<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks at Geret's readings*<br />
**Geret:** Distribute the iodine pills!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** See if they visited last when he was alive? Dr Zerra, can you get an estimate of how old he is?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Possibly, these levels are not extreme, but with longer term exposure they could cause this type of cellular damage<br />
**Geret:** Oooh! Can we put on spacey-suits and investigate it?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'd advise against using EVA suits, we are causing enough cultural contamination as-is. I don't think we should flaunt too much of our technology<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not think they visited while he was alive, or surely he would be able to provide an estimate such as "when I was a young lad"<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The space suits were in closet D, which is currently somewhere in that cluster of overhead flaming debris from where the port nacelle broke off during entry.<br />
*Skig points at series of red flaming streaks falling through the sky.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I think we should wait for this specialist of theirs<br />
*Skig hopes Zox didn't leave a Type-2 phaser in there, which is found by some primitive spacefaring people, who then use it to create a large Empire and slaughter millions.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would concur.<br />
**T'Kor:** I am already in radiation shielding, so I can explore closer to the location and provide the readings for you to analyze<br />

[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 16]**<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I don't think these levels of radiation are an immediate concern<br />
**T'Kor:** Would they have anything to do with whatever knocked us from the sky? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We didn't read any radiation during our descent, it may be related but I doubt it is causal <br />
**Geret:** With 89.9999782% confidence, I can say that it is a technology that far exceed what our new tribal friends could produce. <br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man stares at his feet and sweats profusely while the away team discusses in languages he cannot comprehend*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, can you coordinate with Subfunky third degree Geret on the location of the radiation to the angle of deployment from the field that knocked us out of orbit?<br />
*Skig looks at Middle-aged man.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ensign, when we get back to the Lister I'm going to send you a primer on accuracy vs. precision<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously to the hunter)*: You are forgiven<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Aye<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And Viraseti, can you make sure the Golden Retriever of Starfleet does not run off and get you eaten?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'll do my best ma'am<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): As long as you do not roll a 20 followed by a 14</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** If this "blight" is simple radiation exposure it should be easy to give treatment for the cellular damage, but the only long-term cure for radiation sickness is to remove the radiation<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, ask our new friend how long the Blight has been going on, when the last time the Seekers of Flame were here, and how old he is?<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: How old are you?<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** I have seen 41 summers, Nanon<br />
**Geret: [ INSIGHT  (9) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 11]**<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: And for how many summers has the blight been known?<br />
**Geret:** Nanon, that woud be equivalent to 49.27654 standard years.<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** The blight first befell us shortly before my son's birth. 11 summers hence.<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man continues looking intently at the ground and never raising his head.*<br />
**Geret:** or ~13 years ago<br />
**Geret:** Also Skig, the harmonics from the radiation source match the theta wave from the signal that hit your shuttle when everything started going crazy. There may be a connection. <br />
**T'Kor:** So a few years before the end of the war? <br />
*Geret continues playing with a tricorder and skillfully tapping buttons.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** A few years before the start of the war.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thank you Subfunky Third Degree<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Stupid translator. I meant, "Enisgn Geret"<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Wait, do you not know our names?<br />
*Skig checks "autocorrect" settings on translator.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Have you been using your translator to interpolate our names into your speech?<br />
*Skig looks at Viraseti.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Whatever are you getting at Psycho-Science-Woman?<br />
*Skig takes off translator and shakes it.*<br />
*Skig puts it back on.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes Commander Viraseti, I know your name.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** What about my first name?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Perhaps Commander Skig's lack of interpersonal development is something we should address at a later date?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's Lisa, right?<br />
*Skig really hoping it was not Bart, but she gets them confused when she watches that show.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Exactly, the Zox-Repair-Drone is right.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hold Please.<br />
*Skig takes communicator off.*<br />

*Skig puts communicator back on.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, so what were we discussing before the communicator went on the fritz?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We need to get off this planet as soon as possible, before we do any more damage to these people's development<br />
**Geret:** I think we are too late.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ensign Geret's readings of this radiation source seem like the best lead we have<br />
**Geret:** They have seen technology, of this I am sure. They just lack the proper vocabulary to describe it.<br />
**T'Kor:** Can we secure the shuttle against intrusion? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If someone else is interfering in their development, that is a pitty. But it doesn't give us the right to disregard the Prime Directive<br />
*Skig gets out nuclear-armed laser trip mines.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Wait, no, that would be bad.</font><br />
*Skig puts those back, does not want to pay the Escalation cost.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti is correct, we need to address this as quickly as possible.<br />
**T'Kor:** I meant Old Faithless, but I agree<br />
**Geret:** Does the Prime Directive cover civilizations that once had very near interstellar capability, but then fell apart?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We should discuss what we can with the village elder he mentioned and then head to the source of the radiation.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Aye<br />
*Dr. Zerra takes out his medkit*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will make sure the shuttle is secured and locked down as well as possible, given the damage, so if anyone comes along and pokes around, they will not get access to it. Also, we need to setup some annoyance fields like the one that is keeping the animals at bay to keep creatures away from our shuttlecraft.<br />
**T'Kor:** We should be careful of the elder, in case they are gifted with any unusual tongues<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Just to be safe, I'm going to give everyone a cellular enhancer. It should prevent any negative effects from the radiation for a while at least<br />
**Geret:** Why not get T'kor to tell them he is here to do battle with Sniffles, Bringer of Blight, and that they must safely evacuate in the direction opposite the radiation, and only come back in a week?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, can you see if it is possible to rig up that noise maker you invented to keep the animals away in a portable form so we don't have to fight our way through hordes of whatevers?<br />
**T'Kor:** It is my understanding that this would be interfering in their culture. Minimal contact is ideal<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Good thinking<br />

**Geret:** Okay, you find a way to get them to hide while the technological adults meddle in their affairs.<br />
*Skig hands Geret a 2000 piece puzzle from one of the storage cabinets on Old Faithless to keep her occupied.*<br />
**T'Kor:** We should keep in mind that anything we tell them can and will be incorporated in future visits<br />
*Geret is distracted my colorful designs and no longer in weighty questions of morality.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** After speaking with their Eldar, we could tell them we are concerned that we may be spreading the Blight by our presence and they should stay away from the area. It is the truth as they would understand it.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Or Eldar, unless we have joined the 40k Universe.</font><br />

**Geret:** but readings weren't THAT strong.<br />

*Skig gets out Tricoder, sets to "Break Fifth Wall", checks for Tyranid spores.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree with Skig, on balance I think scaring them away in vague terms is safer than allowing them to observe us for an extended period.<br />
*Geret takes note of the crews general acceptance of white-lies for a later date.*<br />
**T'Kor:** Shall I send our hunter away? <br />
*Skig has a panic attack when she realizes that Throk is a SAURUS from Warhammer fighting against Space Orks.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Unless you want him to lead us to this elder<br />
**T'Kor:** I think the other two went to fetch their elder<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Elder is already coming, best to get the local hierarchy on our side with our minor deception.<br />
**Geret:** Can't we just leave a hologram to baffle these locals?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, Ensign Retriever, I was planning to do just that.<br />

**T'Kor:** Should we expose them to holograms?<br />
**Geret:** I begin to think you have no native lore...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Your use of native is incorrect, as a Tholian, he would have considerable lore NATIVE to his species which is likely ALIEN to you.<br />
*T'Kor was pretty confused by that*<br />
**Geret:** I mean ...I guess so.<br />
>As Skig works on securing the shuttle, a tall older female of the same species as the hunters comes out of the bush accompanied by the younger hunter. She is thin, almost sickly so. And her face and hands are covered in lesions<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Unless you meant naive, which, well, no comment at this time.<br />
**Pinek:** Nanon, Shaper of the World's Fire, creator of heaven and earth, binder of life and death, I am priestess Pinek. Have you come to answer our prayers?<br />
*Skig makes sure the woman does not get near Old Faithless, who knows if what that creature has is contagious to HER shuttlecraft.*<br />
*Pinek kowtows in front of T'Kor*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zerra, please get as much data and readings as you can from her to see if the Blight in question is radiation caused or something else?<br />
**T'Kor:** Shall I have the others leave? <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Yes ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, this is fine for now.<br />
*Geret is so incredibly confused by silicon based life, as T'kor is deadpan and technical, and Kolea is pure emotion.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Find out what their prayers are, how long the Blight has been happening, when it started, etc.<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Which prayers do you come bearing?<br />
*Skig goes back to working on Old Faithless and only pays partial attention.*<br />
**Pinek:** Nanon, we pray for forgiveness for whatever trangression we committed to cause the blight. We have prayed daily for your guidance, your leadership, and your mercy.<br />
**Pinek:** I could not bring our offerings here, we have gathered them in your temple, but I was too weak to carry them<br />
**Pinek:** If you accompany me, I can show you that we have not been praying idly<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Then you may offer through your words in a test of wisdom instead. Which transgression brought upon the blight?<br />
*Pinek sobs*<br />
**Pinek:** We do not know Shaper Nanon! We have wondered for so long what we did to offend you.<br />
**Pinek:** The people look to me for guidance, but your ways are mysterious and beyond my understanding, Shaper<br />
*Pinek collapses to the ground, brought to tears by T'Kor's mocking question*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You're doing great ensign<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Turn your chin up, faithful one. What happened toward the start of the Blight?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Umm...we should find out if she has seen other Shapers and if they looked like Nanon, how long ago, and so on. In some sort of eloquent way that does not make the woman cry?<br />

*Skig wonders what it is about Tholians that they seem to be obsessed with Faithless and Faithful things. She adds, "read-up on Tholian culture" to her weekend activities list.*<br />
**Pinek:** The blight started in the temple, the first speaker was the first to die<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Find out where the Temple is, if it is in the direction of the radiation source we might be on to something...<br />
**Pinek:** I was only Fifth Speaker then, but so many in the temple have perished<br />
*Skig notes that "promotion through attrition" works in this society, just like in Starfleet.*<br />
**Pinek:** That is how we knew it had to be our fault, we speak with the voice of the Keepers, and we were being struck down. The people kept looking to us for answers, but our prayers did nothing<br />
**T'Kor:** Are we permitted to provide any aid as thanks for them aiding us in looking into the matter? <br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I will need some tissue samples to analyze, but if this is radiation damage it should be reperable<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You can't administer medical care to these people. I know you mean well, but you can't interfere in their development. Even if it means their death<br />
*Geret looks deflated and determines the puzzle is more fun than this situation*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We need to know what the damage is, Viraseti. If it is radiation poisoning we can account for that, if it is some other biological contaminant we need to know what it is to protect ourselves from it.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree with you ma'am, but whatever we find we can't go around taking tissue samples and curing these people's radiation sickness<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** "These people" didn't give themselves radiation sickness, it was clearly done to them. We can't just comdemn them to die slowly from cellular damage<br />

**Geret:** I'd like to think sentient beings deserve better than being trapped in a radioactive petri-dish for some esoteric philosopher. Boo Prime directive.<br />
**T'Kor:** Let us revisit the conversation later. Can we secure our shuttle while we are gone? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Already done<br />
**T'Kor:** Do we travel together, or split up? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We should stick together, limit the chance of unintended contamination<br />

*Geret 's grin looks a little...titled.*<br />

**T'Kor:** I was thinking we have two locations to investigate; the temple and the source of the radiation. Or maybe it's secretly one location? <br />

**Geret:** It's almost surely one location now<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Offer a prayer in the direction of the temple and your offerings, and we shall begin.<br />
**Pinek:** Of course Shaper, it would be my honor to show you the offerings we have gathered<br />
*Pinek begins walking into the woods along with the two hunters, while muttering a prayer under her breath*<br />
>The away team is led into a primitive humanoid village. The residents live in simple stone and wood dwellings, most only a single story. The village is centered around a much larger, more imposing stone structure with a spire approximately 12 meters tall above a large stone structure with ornate stylings. No doubt the temple in question.<br />

>In front of it, there is a public square where the away team finds a statue that suspiciously resembles T'Kor. On closer inspection though, the statue is clearly not Tholian, although it is a six-limbed insect of some kind. It's body segmentation is different, and it has different limb articulation. But the presentation of the form wreathed in flame, glowing hot orange, does lend it a bit of a resemblance.<br />

*Geret claps and cheers the team*<br />
>As the away team takes in the environment, Skig reprograms the universal translator to recognize and translate the alien ideograms<br />

**Geret:** T'kor, are you sure you don't want to crack open a drone and feast on some delicious energy?<br />
**Geret:** They are rich in essential electrons and photons.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Tholians just have a high body temperature, he isn't made of energy<br />
*Skig refrains from making the comment she really wants to.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** He can't eat electricity<br />
**Geret:** Bawwww<br />
**T'Kor:** My kind are actually made of a crystaline silica, we "ingest" different compounds and crystals at regular intervals<br />
**Geret:** Are semi-conductors then, semi-delicious?<br />
**T'Kor:** It is less convenient than your body's propensity to store energy around the waist and thighs<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti considers shooting Geret for that pun*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Interesting, that button actually means "Drone Deactivation Initiate" and not "Drone Self Procreation Process"<br />
*Skig is disappointed her plans for a Drone Army are delayed.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I thought it read "Drone Self Destruct Procreation Process" and was both confused and alarmed<br />
**Geret:** The visual effect should be enough<br />
**Geret:** The locals are 100% spooked.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, so we can turn on the flames and the force field using those options.<br />
*T'Kor reactivates both the fire and the force field*<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not know how sound resistant these fires are<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti and Zerra, can you both work on isolating and determining how to neutralize the source of radiation?<br />
**Geret:** Plus, you could command them to bring us refreshments, and we could more easily recieve them.<br />
**Geret:** The radiation is now cinnamon; it eminates from directly below our location.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, can you run a diagnostics on this system to see if we can identify what caused any irregularities in the system. Possibly earthquake or whatever caused these cave-ins?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Geret, can you go down to the local convenience store and pick us up some Monburans?<br />

**T'Kor:** Checking to see what it reports now, give me one moment. <br />
*Geret Im not sure they have those here, theres no 24/7 or family marts around.*<br />
**Geret:** Im not sure they have those here, theres no 24/7 or family marts around.<br />
**T'Kor:** This is interesting formatting and UI. I think I could incorporate some of this into upgrads for Old Faithless<br />
**Geret:** the only AM/PM is 2 planets away<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If you look hard enough, I'm sure you will find one closer.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't think any of these product placements have been approved by the network<br />
**T'Kor:** It does appear that ther's some damage to the reactor core. It's in a subdued state to minimize strain on the system. <br />
**Geret:** Can we....take all the spicy materials and throw it into the Old Faithful's reactor? These natives can live in peace then.<br />
**Geret:** If there's a transporter room nearby, which there is, we might be able to beam it into our shuttle directly<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Is that what has been leaking radiation? And do we have the ability to repair it in a way that is not harmful to the natives, yet disables the fuel neutralization process?<br />
**Geret:** It doesn't look like natives here appreciate the full spectrum of radiological flavors...I think they only understand bad things.<br />
**T'Kor:** In order to determine that, we'll need to investigate the reactor itself<br />
**Geret:** Down we go!<br />
**Geret:** Wheee!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ensign, I am medically concerned about your tendency to describe readiation as a flavor<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I want to run a neurolgical scan on you when we get back to the Lister<br />
**Geret:** You should try a ghost pepper. You will suddenly see there is no difference between radiation burns and flavor country.<br />
**T'Kor:** I'd be quite interested in providing assistance with that, if permitted<br />

**T'Kor:** Excuse me, but what is a... "cultural assimilation center"?<br />
**Geret:** You're the god here.<br />
**Geret:** How can Nanon, the keeper of the 7 flames, lord of all creation, not know?<br />
**T'Kor:** Ensign Geret, I think you may forget yourself. I am T'kor, an engineer on the Lister<br />
**T'Kor:  [Total: 0] [Effects: 0] [dChallenge = 0]**<br />
**Geret:** Your claims of god-hood are better documented than your claims of being on the Lister.<br />
*Geret shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Where do you see "Cultural Assimilation Center"?<br />
**T'Kor:** Right here, it's part of the designation of this facility<br />
*T'Kor points at the large, blocky letters at the top of the screen, above the menus*<br />
>As Skig activates the transporter system, a rumble of stone on stone is heard from the main chamber. The heavy stone stairs pivot upwards, blocking the access from above and revealing a transporter pad hidden underneath<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...observation center or assimilation center?<br />
**Geret:** OOh! creepy!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Assimilation could have quite some negative connotations without knowing exactly what they are doing.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Before anyone transports...<br />
**Geret:** Oh no. Don't read the warning labels, that's no fun!<br />
*Skig checks the Transporter logs for (a) things in the buffer (b) list of transport locations.*<br />
**Geret:** Oh....Okay that's smart! Skig's the best!<br />
>The transporter buffer is empty, and the access logs indicate several tranports to/from a ship in orbit around 40 years ago, as well as a handful of site-to-site tranports between the two transporter pads in the temple<br />

**T'Kor:** It looks like this facility has been checked and maintained regularly for centuries. Every 20-50 years, <br />
**Geret:** until recently.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So the last check in was 40 years ago, and the damage happened about 10 years ago.<br />
**T'Kor:** They had mentioned things began to go wrong about 13 years ago<br />
**Geret:** Who are they though?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Let's get the reactor stable and not-leaking, reactivate the forcefield, and then find the answer to that question.<br />
**Geret:** IS there really a race of spider people like that statue? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Possibly.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So who are you volunteering to beam into a reactor room full of radiation from an unknown source?<br />
**T'Kor:** Let us investigate<br />
**Geret:** Why don't you just check your web-browser? That tends to find spiders real quick!<br />
**Geret:** Oh! I'll go! It's Picante Flavor!<br />
**T'Kor:** You can beam me in to investigate, I'll run a scan for the strength and you can beam me out if I don't tell you it's okay<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Although, for the record, on Paktor Beta VII, the Preservers used a statue of a hairy bull with a prehensile tongue as a marker, and that is not at all what they looked like.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent T'Kor, now I don't have to Voluntold you.<br />
*Skig beams T'Kor into scary radiation room.*<br />
*Geret looks deflated.*<br />
*Skig stabs her with a pin to let more air out.*<br />
>T'Kor dematerializes from the transporter pad and rematerializes on a small transporter pad next to a huge open room. The floor of the large room is at least 40 meters down, and in the center of the room is a small black dot surrounded by a swirling mass of energy and debris.<br />

>As he scans the reactor, T'Kor suddenly feels the tug of an unstable spacial distortion cast off from the roiling, unshielded reactor core. He begins to be pulled off the platform, but is just able to grab on to a guard rail before falling into the deep pit beneath. He is left dangling from the rail over a 40 meter drop, being pelted by debris caught in the distortions from the reactor<br />

>Captain's Log, supplemental: Skig's survey team missed their rendevouz and are now several hours overdue. We have been unable to reach them on comms, and we can't read the shuttle's warp signature anywhere. Lt. Malat and the Twins are tracking its ion trail to retrace its steps. I hope I don't end up regretting approving Skig's request to use that junker for the survey. If we're lucky, they were just kidnapped by Gorn slavers or something. If the shuttle blew up predictably, I'm going to get called in for another command review...<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I was worried that Skig's death trap just exploded and would reflect negatively on my command<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can't be held accountable for something that wasn't listed. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Communications flow towards an unlisted system in Cardassian space. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Couldn't have hit Old Faithless that hard, otherwise I imagine she'd have disintegrated in the descent <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I wonder if they just accidentally flew into one of them? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey, these are not peaceful satellites, they are not filing the Encylopedia Galactica with survey data. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What kind of data are they sending?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We have not much time. Recomend looping by the moon and extracting our crew before the satellites' owners arrive.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The objects are only 1.5 meters across, and there are approximately 64 of them. The odds of the shuttle hitting one by chance are less than 1 in 10 to the 11<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I agree with Zox<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we reach them on comms? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not at this range, we're outside comm badge range<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Then let's move in closer, Zox keep an on those satellites<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Murry to Away Team, do you read? Is anyone there? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hello Murry, we are here but have experienced a few challenges.<br />
**T'Kor:** Excuse me, Skig, I hate to interrupt, but there's an unshielded singularity here and I'd like to request a beam out at your earliest convenience<br />
**Geret:** The machines! They are hungry for energy!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** For instance, I believe T'Kor is in need of emergency transport due to discovering a highly radioactive energy field killing the natives.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Additionally, Old Faithless lost an engine on impact with the planet, and I request you keep the Lister out of range from the energy dampening field being emitted by the defense mechanism of this complex we are in.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are not reading power drain<br />
*Skig stops to think for a second.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And I think I have brought you up to speed on everything going on here.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we beam them up from this distance? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, as long as the Lister is not in danger. However, T'Kor still needs transport as I do not think it would be safe for us to try and retrieve him.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh yes, someone beam up Mt. T'kor<br />
**Geret:** But beams are energy, and *they* are still hungry! Better divert them with another tasty energy source before the singnal is eaten!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** And then move us back to a higher orbit, if Skig is worried about the power drain best to play it safe. <br />
**T'Kor:** Thank you, Chief Engineer. I was starting to get concerned that my lack of decorum was the issue<br />
*Skig gets out dictionary and looks up WTH "decorum" means.*<br />
*Geret skig definition: using fancy twisty ties on cables.*<br />

Only via offering decoys, or reflecting these beams have we had any success in countering this bizzare reverse energy endothermic weaponry.<br />

We can prepare the necessary briefing for you. But, you have us at a disadvantage. You've reached us here at the USS Lister, but I'm afraid we don't know what to call you yet. <br />

*T'Kor can't really tell from a computer screen, given how different images look on there compared to his normal experiences*<br />
*Zox tries to understand Hailey being all diplomatic.*<br />
**Satag:** You address Primark Satag of the Xepai Collective, and your assertion of innocence is irrelevant<br />
**Throk:** Throk impressed we find non-glowy version of T'Kor's people. Maybe T'Kor needs to discuss proper skin care techniques with them? Ishemok, can you arrange for sample sizes for free for them to test with suitable markup for later purchases?<br />
**Throk:** Throk thinks Satag guy translator must be broken, to use word "innocent" when describing Ship's Counselor.<br />
**Throk:** For the record, it is 2381, not sure humans can remember agreements from 2344.<br />
**Throk:** They have short lifespan.<br />
**Satag:** The Federation agreed to honor all Cardassian border agreements with third parties within a 100 light-year radius of the demilitarized zone. The Cardassian Union ceded authority over Xepai space to the Xepai Collective<br />
**Throk:** Also, Satag, I am curious, do you enter larval state and break from carapace when you need to grow, or does your chitin naturally expand?<br />
**Geret:** and is your national sport, cricket?<br />
**Satag:** You will cease all hostile activity within Xepai space or be destroyed<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We didn't start this? Skig, am I correct, based on the sensor logs, that your personal ship, pride of the Lister, Ye Olde Faithless, was targeted?<br />
**T'Kor:** It seems reasonable to me, though we do have the hiccup of needing to get our Away Team back on board. We'll also need a copy of their side of the treaty, as well as a strongly worded letter to higher command to forward over to the Cardassians. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It seems reasonable to me, though we do have the hiccup of needing to get our Away Team back on board. We'll also need a copy of their side of the treaty, as well as a strongly worded letter to higher command to forward over to the Cardassians. <br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): (delete first)</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Security Chief Zox, while I must generally agree that anything targeting Old Faithless is a hostile act, the fact is we may have been unintentionally trespassing and activated an automated system.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Federation would have similar systems in place, and the response was to disable, not destroy.<br />
*Captain Baras unmutes the comm line*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Did you feel your person(s) were threatened by a sudden loss of power and dramatic crash onto moon?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** As a result, I would suggest we merely try to defuse the situation by retrieving my command and I and the shuttle craft and departing to open communications with this new spacefaring entity on equal and less intrusive footing.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Or is that how engineers have fun, ya know, like normal people sky-dive or mountain climb to feel alive?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We apologize for any intrusion, our away team seems to have stumbled upon an automated security system and activated it unintentionally. Our records do not indicate this system as being part of your borders, we would be happy to update Starfleet records to properly reflect Xepai space and be on our way after we recover our away team from the moon<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I never feel threatened in Old Faithless, for I know it will survive when other Shuttle craft have been detonated into small pieces while falling into the accretion disk of a double wormhole singularity.<br />
**Geret:** but but....we can't leave those people down there, dying slowly of radation? Can we?<br />
**Satag:** We accept your apology. But your away team has interfered unacceptably in our colonization plan. Our sensor logs indicate they have communicated with the inhabitants <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Only if we play the DS:9 music to close. TNG wouldn't let that shit fly.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We should discuss this with the Xepai and work collectively to correct the problem...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, well, yes, there is that small problem.<br />
**Satag:** We require that you identify all persons contacted by your away team so that they can be terminated in order to prevent further spread of the contamination<br />
**Throk:** Throk in awe of your understanding of Starfleet Prime Directive!<br />
**Satag:** You have one rotation of this moon to comply, or we will destroy you<br />

*Throk drops off cookies and milk and leaves the room.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ordinarily I would agree with you, but I don't see that we have any other options<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We can't start a war with them over one village, and the Prime Directive limits our options here<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If we aren't willing to stand for one village, what are we?<br />
**T'Kor:** Would it be possible that we just beam up the contacted individuals and replace them with body doubles to be slaughtered? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr Zerra, can you brief the rest of the command staff on the condition of the observed aliens based on the radiation they have been exposed to?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ah yes, that...<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well remember when you went into the temple and I went up with Pinek?<br />

*Throk drops off pina colada's, fruit smoothies, and ice cream for command staff, walks back out.*<br />

*Throk puts on the Firefly episode, "Jaynestown" to play in the background.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Intercept and spoof their communications network and destroy them. <br />
*Zox shrugs*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We can't start a war with the Xepai Commander Zox. I don't want to see those people killed, but we need a third option<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What if the Federation needs a new war?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** The last one wasn't enough for you?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** 118 million dead <br />
**T'Kor:** Is it possible that we can beam them aboard and rig their faulty power systems down there to explode, wiping the whole village off the map but saving all the locals? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh, these guys can't be as big as the Cardassian Empire.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** And the Federation is not as expansionary, we don't go around starting wars with neighboring civilizations just because we don't like them.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Beam everyone up, store them in transporter buffers, tell the Xepai we will address the problem we created ourselves, scan the entire village, blow up the current one to "get rid of the locals" and then recreate them in a new spot in a replica of their existing village somewhere not drenched in radiation.<br />
**Ishemok:** Can we buy them off?<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not think we'll be able to reconstruct their temple<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I didn't get the sense that Primark Satag was interested much in money<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The exterior of the temple is all we really care about, T'Kor.<br />
**Ishemok:** Flatter them, tell them how much we love their experiment, how it satisifies our deepest curiosity about civilization.<br />
**Ishemok:** What if they want technology rather than latinum?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Also they seem to be monitoring the planet, that just runs the risk that they come back later and find a larger level of contamination, killing even more of the inhabitants to remove it<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** To do that, we'd have to understand why they're running these experiments<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** He said it was a "colonization plan"<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, I agree. I think it'd be easier if we just lifted all these people off the planet for good. Could we settle them on the other planet? <br />

<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): What does the prime directive say about letting *other* aliens conduct experiments on primative cultures?</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We cannot make decisions based on the hypothetical harms to potential future people! There are real, living people in that village who were dying a slow and paingful death<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I can't predict the future, but without treatment I know that those people would have died painfully over months.<br />
**Ishemok:** So you are saying, we can't let these poor, downtrodden people be squashed by insects?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am saying that we can't possibly predict the long term consequences of our actions on the development of an entire culture.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Recklessly inserting ourselves into the natural course of their pre-warp evolution could have impacts on the future lives of billions of Venonans<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I may be a cold-blooded monster, but we should free the planet from the grip of the Xepai. If the Voth hadn't left Earth, there'd be no Federation and no Prime Directive.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** "Could have", "Future lives" <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Give life a chance.<br />
**Throk:** Throk agree with Viraseti, after all, who expected invention of Twitter to cause 2 centuries of mental retardation in humans?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's equally possible that Dr Zerra's mercy will serve as a role model for them for ages to come and serve as a foundation of mercy and understanding that will lead their people to be enlightened even beyond the Federation's ken. But really, we should not deal with the hypotheticals, we have a real situation to focus on. <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** What's done is done, if you want to report me for it later you can<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But we need to figure out a way to stop the Xepai from exterminating these people<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Philosophical matters aside, we have the small issue of the Xepai plotting to exterminate them all and determining the best course of action.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think that the Xepai would have demanded the town's elimination regardless of how much contact Dr Zerra would have had. The ship was sighted by the town on its descent<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, as Zerra said.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We can't necessarily assume that Counselor. We don't really know what motivates the Xepai<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What level of contamination makes them willing to wipe out the village? What are they even doing here?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That's true. I was thinking that the contamination was in contact with an advanced civilization, but it may have been the medical contact or treatment. What information do we have on the Collective? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Psst. They want minerals and energy. I'm not certain they are as different as you think.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, their motivation might have been, "What impact on a sentient species does exposing them to a faulty Romulan style warp-singularity have on their physical and mental well-being?"<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Very little, this is strictly speaking a first contact situation.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, we are dealing with two first contact situations. One the Prime Directive is very clear on, the other, as a sparefaring society, it is established we should do our best to come to an amicable solution to open the door to Starfleet's Diplomatic Corps in a positive way.<br />
*Skig is worried she has committed some major faux pas and has killed all conversation.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though one does have to wonder how the Federation would feel about the experimentation they're doing as well. We need more information<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True, but that was not Throk this week.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Captain Baras. I have located an M-class planet of similar composition and mineral content at location QWERTY-1234. Perhaps we could negotiate for a slight redrawing of this netural zone and offer the Xepai our planet for this one, hence, placing the Venonan within the protective custody of the Federation.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Viraseti and Zerra can settle their debate, but we should get the Xepai out of the situation.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Abducting people from their homeworld and depositng them on a new planet "for their own good" is no better than the colonialism of ancient Earth<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We aren't re-locating anyone =D<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hold on, Viraseti, would you actually rather we kill them all? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** There is also the problem of the carrying capacity of the Lister. There are at least several thousand Venonans in the village, to transport them all aboard the Lister would require dozens of round trip journeys<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We should be focusing on convincing the Xepai not to purge the village and limit any further contact with the Venonans<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** If the Xepai cannot be convinced, then we should have a backup plan<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** At least Zox has a plan to avoid massive bloodshed, we just need to work out the details<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** To that end, I think I'm going to go gather up some details so we can begin our first contact and offer an exchange of cultures. That might help clue us in on what their mores and folkways are<br />

*Skig does not recommend sending over Zox and Throk in the initial boarding party to demonstrate our willingness to work with other cultures, as a postscript adds Murry to that list also.*<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): It's okay, Baras was asleep</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, I think you have misinterpreted Zox's thick Voth accent.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, he clearly wants to trade the Xepai some other planet and not rellocate the Venonans. What the hell did you think he said?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** He meant that we would offer to exchange QWERTY-1234 with the Xepai and keep this world, effectively redrawing the boarders between our two species.<br />

>Satag spends some time updating the Starfleet records with Murry to reflect their borders. Murry is able to build something of a raport with the surly bug-man as they discuss it. The borders he lays out extend to several adjacent star systems beyond this one, but are relatively small compared to larger regional powers.<br />

**Satag:** I hope now your Federation will respect our borders in the future Counselor<br />
**Kolea:** A firm understanding of borders is a key ingredient to mutual respect of those borders, thank you for taking the time to assist us with this.<br />
*Kolea nudges Murry to suggest swapping some planets around.*<br />

**Satag:** Unlike your Federaion, we are not expansionist. We remain in the confines of our space and do not blindly violate others'.<br />
*Throk shows Zox his latest issue of, "Gorn Cookiing" which features recipes with 1.7m tall insects and different uses of butter and herbs.*<br />
**Kolea:** I can empathize as I despise being blindfolded while being violated.<br />
*Satag squints at Kolea*<br />
**Satag:** That seems to be obviously implied by the meaning of those words, unless my translator is malfunctioning<br />
*Throk wonders how warm it is under that costume for the actor inside it, who will be unknown until the end credits.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** First impressions are important. With that said, we would like to inquire about a trade in planets. There are a few planets that we've done some analysis on already. Would any of these be of interest to your people? <br />
**Satag:** We have no interest in expanding our borders<br />
*Throk rotates screen 90 degrees to get a better idea of how to put Satag on a spit.*<br />
*Throk nudges Zox.*<br />
**Satag:** Our last border expansion was 60 or your years ago, and our population forecasts project another 200 of your years before we require another world to colonize<br />
**Throk:** I think Pad Satag would be a good option for me to submit to Gorn Cooking.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Venonan</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Speaking of which, your colonization here. I can't help but notice that it's the Venonan down on the planet instead of the Xepai. <br />
*Geret begins to think that time flies when talking to insects.*<br />
**Satag:** Yes, they are native to this planet. It will be many centuries before they are prepared to integrate into the Collective<br />
**Kolea:** By joining the Collective, you would, as they become capable of space flight, add them to your species' governmental structure as a member species?<br />
**Satag:** Yes. But they must be carefully prepared to avoid damaging our consensus<br />
*Zox begins to think of aphids farmed by ants.*<br />
**Kolea:** The Federation works along similar ideas, albeit in a more raucous and disruptive fashion at times.<br />
**Satag:** Your Federation is rife with disagreement and disunity<br />
**Kolea:** Exactly.<br />
**Satag:** We do not simply incorporate alien cultures into our consensus<br />
**Satag:** They must be shaped and guided to ensure that they will function smoothly in our society<br />
**Satag:** Your interference has jeapordized that<br />
**Kolea:** Those disagreements can lead to strength at times and maintain stronger racial identities for the member species, but there is a risk of disunity from it, as you have observed.<br />
**Satag:** Your doctor answered their prayers without them taking action<br />
**Satag:** Such cultural lessons encourage weakness<br />
**Satag:** Weakness is not tollerated in the collective<br />
*Ishemok hangs his pixels in shame, so quick to judge a horrible bug monster.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I see, what sort of action were you awaiting? <br />
**Satag:** If they are allowed to spread this message, it could poison their entire culture<br />
**Kolea:** Question though, I can't help but notice that outside the building with the failed singularity, a statue in the likeness of your species. Is the intent to spread a cultural message to them of worship of a spacefaring insectoid species?<br />
**Geret:** But aren't things like Radiation impossible for them to grok? It isn't fair to offer them the prospect at technological and moral progress without a smooth incline of difficulty?<br />
**Satag:** We have elected to use their pre-existing religious beliefs as a tool to guide their development<br />
*Satag turns to Geret*<br />
**Satag:** The radiation exposure was unintentional, but before we could repair it the inhabitants had already discovered the symptoms<br />
*Kolea checks notes.*<br />
**Satag:** Many villages had radiation sickness<br />
**Satag:** However, in most the inhabitants began experimenting, looking for solutions on their own<br />
**Geret:** I can empathize with everything you have said so far, except testing them with a challenge they couldn't hope to overcome naturally, as it is not of their world.<br />
**Kolea:** And they had tried, to the best of their ability, to offer up placation and supplication for this particular village.<br />
**Satag:** And we stepped in only when they could plausibly believe that such a solution had worked<br />
**Satag:** This village has been praying for salvation for decades<br />
**Satag:** And has done nothing at all to save themselves<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ah, I see. And this village had been focusing on placation rather than actually acting to fix the situation? <br />
**Satag:** You have now shown them that blind devotion to an uncaring god is the solution to their problems<br />
**Satag:** And they will spread that message<br />
**Satag:** We would rather that they die as a lesson to the other inhabitants that their gods will not save them if they cannot lift a finger to save themselves<br />
**Geret:** Primark Satag. Could you not impersonate a Venonan, and show the process of science to them? Can you give them hints to reveal the potential that is there? This test may be exceedingly harsh.<br />
*Satag pulls out the cultural database Murry sent him*<br />
*Kolea (mutters) I really can't argue his point when I kind of agree with it.*<br />
**Satag:** There is a saying in your own culture: "Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he will eat for life"<br />
**Geret:** I can see the utility and your logic, but being exposed to a problem beyond their progress just seems out of scope, an impossible feat.<br />
**Satag:** And yet, the other villages when faced with the same problem did everything in their power to save themselves<br />
*Kolea passes sticky note to Geret, "But evidently other villages figured out how to handle it or moved out of the area."*<br />
**Geret:** Oh? Do tell. <br />
**Geret:** Interesting!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Were the malfunctions intentional, then? <br />
**Satag:** No, but the locals had noticed the symptoms before we discovered them<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The locals of one village, but what of the others? <br />
**Geret:** Hrm, have you considered what us humans call 'carrots' vs 'sticks' to coerce behavior? You have mastered the stick, but what about the carrot?<br />
**Satag:** This has been enlightening Counselor, but our problem remains<br />
**Satag:** We cannot allow this village to contaminate the broader Venonan culture. If you cannot find some way to repair the damage of this cultural lesson of undeserved benevolence, then we will be force to eliminate it in our own way<br />
**Satag:** You have... <br />
*Satag checks his chronometer*<br />
**Satag:** 18 of your hours remaning<br />
*Satag gets up and skitters back to the transporter room*<br />
*Throk offers to fix Satag's sundial.*<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Now you're talking my language.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, I've seen her unhappy, this is more like mildly choleric.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So we need to avoid contact as much as possible while also preventing the entire village from being wiped out<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Viraseti, can you assist me with a deep amino acid homology search using this sample against all known species?<br />
*Zox puts on glasses*<br />
*Zox puts on a lab coat*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Of course<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The Xepai Collective wanted to wipe out the villlage because of a toxic ideology. Could we somehow make it seem like it was all a ruse by the priesthood? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This is going to be a BLAST<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay, let's see what makes these buggos tick....<br />
**T'Kor:** I believe it is carbon<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would guess they refer to chronometers of some type for time-keeping, and therefore tick in the same way as Commander Bachar, but not Tok in the same way as Kolea.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I like your thinking Hailey, but I don't see how<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** These people are deeply religious, how are we going to break them of that in 16 hours?<br />
**Throk:** By having their current saviour engage in such heinous acts they scorn all religion?<br />
*Throk hands Dr Zerra Type-2 Phaser set to "Genocide"*<br />
*Dr. Zerra spit takes his rak'tajino*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And we have to do so in a way that doesn't convince the Xepai Collective to kill them all<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So we can't just reveal the singularity nor the high tech that makes up the temple<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We could probably imply that the church was the one causing the illness this entire time, all for the sake of power. Perhaps with holograms of some of their deceased priests?<br />
*Zox furiously pushes buttons on computers with Viraseti*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I'm having so much fun doing science with my Starfleet colleagues! This is so much better than having my arm broken again.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am sure you will break your arm again<br />
*Dr. Zerra turns back to murry*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I like the idea of using holograms<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Maybe get T'Kor involved too, since they think he's their god<br />
**T'Kor:** Or one of them, at least. I With some holographs, I could probably appear even closer<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** How do we explain their dead priests, who died first of the radiation caused by the singularity, were trying to gain power?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I was thinking holograms of said priests, secretly alive all this time<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Don't you think it's a wee bit presumptuious that you know how best to guide the Venonan?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We don't need to guide them, we just need to undo our own contamination so the Xepai don't wipe them out<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Xepai are the ones we need to figure out how to... yes, the thing Zerra just said.<br />
**T'Kor:** This is quite the significant goal<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So, I think Viraseti and I just figured out something that may persuade the Xepai of the error of their ways. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Oh is that what you were doing?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I thought we were working on a research paper<br />
*Skig gets out popcorn.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Picking up citations AND fostering interspecies peace are both excellent C.V. buffs<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I call first author<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Sure thing!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What did you find?<br />
*Zox gives Hailey Murry a hug*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We aren't so different, are we, my little egg-stealing mammal?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is getting awkward and I'm sure by now Bachar is looking for us.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Don't get her pregnant again<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Though it's heresy in Voth culture to acknowledge it, we share the same homeworld and the same ancestry.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yet our civilizations are starkly different, and have much to share, only because we were both free to evolve and change and learn in this marvellous universe, independently<br />
*Hailey Murry rubs her temples and performs her own recommended anger management expressions*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is there another underground speceies?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Xepai are actually, albeit distantly, related to the Aurari, they probably have as much to share as Voth and Humans did.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** In either case, directing biological or technological evolution won't produce anything original<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** There's a real case for hands-off, serendipity here. If the Xepai want the Venonans to be the best allies, they need to just leave them alone. They don't have a case for non-interference, what with that giant spider god statue, and neither was our interference welcome. If they want the best allies later, let them develop.<br />
*Cmdr Bachar returns from her meeting with the captain*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What do we have people?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** All options on the table<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We make it known to the Xepai that they are just one branch of their founding species, and they have an extant cousin in the Aurari. One that would have been impossible to learn from had they not diverged so long ago.<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest Dr Zerra commit war crimes against Venovan to drive them into murderous frenzy against their new God.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** equally impossible to learn from had they tried to direct their progress.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Bad Throk, down boy<br />
*Cmdr Bachar sprays Throk*<br />
*Throk tries to give Dr Zerra the Type 2 Phaser again*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Even if they are overly-cold, rational beings, if they want the best allies in the future with new technologies and ideas, they need to learn to be aloof.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Venonans will figure out for themselves what works and what doesn't, but they never had a chance to do so with that ship-wreck<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do we know if this is a position that this specific species in the Collective holds or is this a Collective thing in general?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Aurari are very independent, compared to the more collective Xepai<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So, it would appear to be more unique to the Xepai<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** According to the cultural exchange data you negotiated for, their social organization is extremely rigid but highly egalitarian<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** They have no real leaders, they have a consensus-based governance<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So this would largely be an agreed upon viewpoint? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** It seems to be<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I think there's no harm in Zox trying to talk to them, but time is limited and that seems like a long-shot.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I still want a backup option in case Zox suplexes this one into a table as well<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It would explain why they seek consensus and do not want confrontational additions to their collective.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes Commander, I just take this one personally, as many Voth were scorned as heretics for suggesting commonalitiies with humanity. It really helped us learn and grow once we got over it. I would not want to deprive the Xepai of this, nor would I want to see the Venonans deprived of their right to develop.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This is exactly where the Federation's ideas are best. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This isn't even confrontational, I think they're concerned that the Nonan are being too non-confrontational, resorting only to prayer rather than action<br />
*Zox tears MIGHTY dino tears.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes, but that will sort itself out<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Alright Zox, I'm convinced. You can go ahead and invite Satag back to the Lister and talk to him. But in the meantime: Murry, Skig and Zerra, I want you to keep working on an alternative<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Dismissed<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey - which would you trust more, a civilization that learns to prune bad ideas when confronted with them, or one that lacks this ability, having never been exposed to some?<br />
*Zox adjusts his lab glasses, looking to Hailey*<br />
>INTERIOR - Transporter Room: Zox has put on his finest dress golds to welcome Satag back to the Lister and attempt to defuse the conflict at hand.<br />

*Satag materializes on the pad*<br />
**Satag:** Greetings again<br />
**Satag:** To what end have you invited us to return?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Greetings, Primark Satag<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Two of our top scientists have some knowledge that may expand your mind. The Xepai are a larger family than you may think, for you are related to the Aurarai.<br />
*Zox offers some PADDs with scientific jarble all over them.*<br />
**Satag:** Yes we are aware of this<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting! We would not have thought this given the distances involved!<br />
**Satag:** We have long had diplomatic relations with the Cardassians, through them we are aware of many other species<br />
**Satag:** We remain in our own space, but we are not incurious about the rest of the galaxy. We simply prefer to remain close to our homeworlds<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I find this fascinating, as the Aurarai are known to be very curious by nature.<br />
**Satag:** Do you believe that entire races' behavior is determined by their genetics?<br />
**Satag:** We do not<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(not to Satag)*: Hmmmm, hmmmmm, do you think there may be members of that tribe who are not so convinced?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Absolutely not, I do indeed believe it is a case of culture and ideas.<br />
**Satag:** We agree, the marker of an intelligent species is their ability to behave in ways not dictated by their DNA<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But I do think it is an interesting case in divergence. Would such variety be possible had there not been a split?<br />
*Throk brings in a platter of Venovan sausages.*<br />
**Satag:** That depends. In our culture, such a conflict would have to be resolved in order to come to a consensus. But your ship is full of many different, diverging sorts. So separation is not requried for disagreement in all cases<br />
**Satag:** We must come to agreement to act however, that is our way<br />
**Satag:** Such a fundamental conflict must be resolved in order to function<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is not a better consensus reached by having more robust disagreements?<br />
*Satag laughs*<br />
**Satag:** Our disagreements are very robust<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would the Venonans not be better allies if they are allowed to see the folly of their ways by themselves, such that they would not be led astray later?<br />
*Satag shakes his head subtly*<br />
*Throk agrees with Satag.*<br />
**Satag:** You do not understand <br />
**Throk:** Security Chief does have ability to spray down those who do not understand with phaser fire. Throk think he understand though, consensus only found through application of big words and nap time.<br />
**Satag:** There is a saying from your cultural database: "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes that is a very human encapsulation of the problem.<br />
**Satag:** We do not believe in strength for its own sake, or for one's betterment or personal journey<br />
*Throk notes down that saying for future use.*<br />
**Satag:** But because you must not weaken the social fabric of your people<br />

**Satag:** The Venonan world is inside our space, one way or another they will one day develop warp travel and will have to integrate into our collective<br />
**Satag:** When that happens, we must ensure that they do not weaken the bonds of our society<br />
*Hailey Murry is on a terminal and her pad, sifting through footage and scans from Zerra, the Lister, and Old Faithless*<br />
**Throk:** Throk has serious question.<br />
*Throk raises hand.*<br />
**Satag:** Whether or not they would be stronger themselves by being allowed to develop on their own, they would weaken the collective if not properly prepared<br />
**Throk:** If Venovans develop warp technology but would weaken collective, what would Xepai Collective Response be?<br />
**Satag:** I cannot say. They live in Xepai space, they will be part of the collective no matter what<br />
**Satag:** I cannot predict what consensus will be reached in that future<br />
**Satag:** But if consensus cannot be reached, our social fabric will break down, and I fear conflict would be inevitable<br />
**Throk:** Corollary, if Xepai encountered race inside their space that already has warp technology, and does not agree with collective, how would collective respond?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I used to think this way entirely. As young 'saur, I found humans to be squishy and weak, with bad starship design. The Voth way was superior. But there were some things we could not even concieve of, could not even think of, developed by the Federation. Had we kept the humans as pets, this would have never happened.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And they were such lovable little furry creatures, great for pest control.<br />
**Satag:** We do not see the Venonan as pets<br />
**Satag:** They will inevitably grow into our equals, that is the way of the world. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Correct, but can they be your equals if you too heavily guide their development?<br />

**Satag:** I cannot argue with your position that the Venonan would be better served by developing on their own. Were they not in our space, this would be the best way for their species to proceed<br />
**Satag:** But without proper guidance, they pose an existential risk to our entire social fabric<br />
**T'Kor:** You mentioned that they will, inevitably, become a part of the collective. That would be the results of the Collective's proverbial gardening? <br />
**Satag:** No, they would eventually develop space travel on their own, whether or not we intervene<br />
**T'Kor:** Oh. If they are a poor fit for the Collective at the time, would they still be brought within the folds, then? <br />
**Satag:** They would<br />
**Satag:** Their world is inside our space, it is untenable for them to simply exist as an independent government within our own borders<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Skig, Dr Zerra, look at this. Throk, look at that over there. So it appears that Tabak, the initial man who encountered your crash landing, harbors some pretty bitter feelings about the whole religious caste. It's quite possible that he may be able to convince others. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would a redrawing of borders make this easier?<br />
**T'Kor:** And presumabnly they would not want to leave their home planet behind, yes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That could be an angle to work towards.<br />
**Satag:** Very few do<br />
*Satag turns to Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If it were possible to revise sub-article J of the current treaty, and the Xepai were given a planet of equal or greater material value?<br />
**Kolea:** The surest way to change someone's religion is give them sufficient internal self-worth.<br />
*Kolea is talking in the room with Skig and Murry.*<br />
**Satag:** Planets are not fungible, billions of Xepai live on them. We cannot simply relocate entire worlds for the purpose of redrawing our borders to the benefit of these Venonan<br />
**T'Kor:** Are there billions of Xepai on the Nonan's world? <br />
**Throk:** Throk has another serious question.<br />
*Throk raises hand.*<br />
*Zox looks at Throk*<br />
**Satag:** You do not need to raise your hand<br />
**Throk:** If Xepai society is based on collective agreement.<br />
**Satag:** I am not your brood-docent<br />
**Throk:** Commander Bachar said I need to raise hand when brain is working.<br />
**Throk:** Anyway, not relevant to current conversation.<br />
**Throk:** How do Xepai know that what Venovan's have experienced and their current system of belief is going to negatively effect development in a way that does not strengthen collective through enhancing alternative thought through robust disagreement?<br />
*Satag takes out a small device, sets it on the table, and activates it*<br />
>A blue flame emits from the top of the device, Throk and Zox can feel the heat emitted from it from where they are sitting<br />

**Satag:** Why don't you put your hand in there?<br />
**Satag:** You know little of my people's technology. How do you know that this device won't make you stronger, cure your diseases, end your aging?<br />
**Satag:** Of course you are an intelligent species, you know better than to play with fire on the off-chance it might not burn you<br />
**Satag:** The risk of disunity is too great to take the chance<br />
**Throk:** Technically momentary euphoria caused by immolation could convince someone they are stronger, also, being immolated does cure disease and end aging.<br />
**Throk:** Ergo, your argument is not valid.<br />
*T'Kor puts his hand in the fire*<br />
**Satag:** You do not count<br />
**Satag:** You are made of fire!<br />
*Throk waits for Zox to high-five T'Kor, since Throk is smart enough to know that is a bad idea.*<br />

**Satag:** You have raised some interesting viewpoints. I do admit that our actions are imperfect and it would be better for the Venonans to be left alone<br />
**Satag:** But you have again misunderstood our ways. I am not a leader, I do not make the decisions or give orders, I am bound to carry out the consensus<br />
**Satag:** You have given me much to think about, but I must still continue in our course of action. My own feelings on the matter must be subservient to the consensus<br />

**Throk:** Now that big bug man is gone, Throk have question for Zox. Did you feel that big bug man's head, if turned upside down and detached at thorax, would make great container for chilli cheese dip?<br />
*Kolea grabs spray bottle Bachar left behind and squirts Throk.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Depends if you are aiming for single use or not. Chitin may not hold up through the dishwasher.<br />
**Kolea:** Bad Throk! No eating first contact species!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, so the Xepai put a strong emphasis on self improvement, determination, and inquisitiveness. I think the inquisitveness could serve well here alongside the courage that the Venonan cherish<br />

**Throk:** I think with proper curing and heat, would make decorative platter for at least ten to fifteen uses.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** What are you thinking Counselor?<br />
**Kolea:** Throk, can you go get us some cookies?<br />
**Throk:** Okay.<br />
*Throk leaves.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We know at least one of them who is a bit upset at everything. Would it be possible for us to camouflage ourselves as Venonan and infiltrate? Sow a little skepticism? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I am not eating any of his cookies after that discussion<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I could surgically alter you to appear Venonan. At least some of you, Zox, Throk and T'Kor have different skeletal structures so we can't adequately disguise them<br />
**T'Kor:** Understandable, I am made quite literally of crystal<br />
**Throk:** That might be a way to get the Venonan's to "figure it out themselves", although I feel like this has a negative implication on the Venonan's strong faith.<br />
**Kolea:** That might be a way to get the Venonan's to "figure it out themselves", although I feel like this has a negative implication on the Venonan's strong faith.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wonder if, without the chance to make painful mistakes and truly learn the self-correcting scientific methods, too harsh a lesson may deprive them of a way to truly mature as citizens of the cosmos.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** To be fair, their strong faith might be due for a little shaking. Are there any other locations of radiation poisoning according to the scanners? <br />
**Kolea:** I would be curious how the other villages that the Xepai said, "figured it out" handled this if there an emphasis on faith. It would be not very Prime-Directive of them to try and "break" that facet of Venonan culture to make them more "pliable" to the consensus.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not at the moment, it looks like this village was the only one which Xepai had not yet repaired<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But we get a free 'we can break the prime directive to save the prime directive' clause. It's stronger than my claws even!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we pull out the three most recent repairs and how those villages handled things? <br />
**Kolea:** I dislike the idea of the Xepai using this village as "guinea pigs" for their consensus experiments.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** According to the database provided by the Xepai, other villages experimented with herbal remedies, culled animal populations suspected of carrying disease, and in one case a village simply relocated their entire population<br />
**Throk:** Throk like guinea pigs, they are delicious with hot mustard.<br />
*Throk hands out cookies and then goes to swab out the biocontainment units in the restrooms.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** None of their efforts were meaningfully successful, but the attempts were enough for the Xepai to step in and correct the underlying issues<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think they're really using them as experiments. I think they're trying to shape or allow the Venonan to be shaped in a way that allows an easy merging with their own Collective.<br />
*Throk does not remember to wash hands regularly, as Gorn have very strong immune systems.*<br />
*Zox eats cookies.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long ago were those fixed?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Within 5-10 years<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we find a good scapegoat that this village had done recently?<br />
*Throk yells from the sludge pit, "Dr Zerra is good scapegoat!"*<br />
*Kolea says nothing, as she doesn't want to get promotion-through-attrition in this episode.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, nevermind, we're a little too different from them<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Wait, what if we beamed them a science educational show? I'd teach them all our ways; it would be called Mr. Lizard. <br />
*Skig snores in the corner.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't think they are going to invent radio or televisual communications technology anytime soon<br />
**Kolea:** Perhaps we should consider what is in the PADD and look at that as a form of guidance.<br />
**Kolea:** We want to show the Xepai that this village is good for the Consensus as is.<br />
**Kolea:** They have failed at pretty much every thing listed as part of the collectivism valued, but we need to show how the Venonans can blend their traits to show self-improvement, determination, and inquisitiveness.<br />
**T'Kor:** That desire is perhaps a little tempered for myself, since I can see where the Collective is coming from with this village. And unfortunately, our level of assistance was too thorough and too notable <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, they definitely have Determination<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think this may make me throw up in my mouth: but I like Throk's plan<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Throkk for crewmate of the Month!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Throk's plan is a warcrime<br />
*Kolea checks Lt. Malat's medical records to see if someone has changed her medication.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Obviously you can't murder anyone, but we have 24th century technology. We can put on a pretty good show without killing anyone<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait...I hate to bring this up but...what if they all started to get sick again?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ooh, I like that<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How many of the Venonans actually saw the group of you? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, I look forward to you all over-acting like Earth soap-operas infront of impressionable viewers. I must, however, return this PADD to it's rightful owners.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I saw most of the village while the rest of the away team was in the temple, but the rest of the team only saw 3 Venonans<br />
**Kolea:** We could definitely rig up some way to make them ill through some sort of released aerosol, based on their biological configuration.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** I do not believe they intended for the PADD to be returned<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What if we altered Zerra so he's like a Venonan in disguise, beam him down to readminister the new cure, and play it off as if it was all a complex hoax?<br />
**Kolea:** We could also just have the Dr beam down and, you know, shoot a lot of them with the stun setting and we could... pretend to be horrible slavers and the Venonans fight back and rescue themselves?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** There's still an anti-matter reactor on the fritz down there.<br />
**Kolea:** Wait, that sounds a bit too much like my show after this one, on Cinemax.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The Xepai can repair the reactor if we correct the cultural contanimation <br />
**Kolea:** Or PlayOrion, I forget which, but you get the idea.<br />
*Throk makes popcorn and ensures QR code for Kolea's other show is available in the corner of the screen.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wait, so this whole problem is solved by fixing the reactor?<br />
*Skig woke up when someone mentioned doing an actual engineering/science thing.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, nevermind.<br />
*Skig goes back to sleep.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If you would like to go repair the reactor while we discuss our options, I am sure no one would object<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not envy the repairs on that reactor <br />
**T'Kor:** I'd rather stay safe, like on Old Faithless<br />
>The Captain and Commander re-enter the briefing room<br />

*Zox stands at attention.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I hope you all have some good news to share, Starfleet Command is not pleased with how our first contact with the Xepai has gone thus far<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We only have 10 hours left on Satag's ultimatum, so let's get all of our options on the table and decide on the best course of action here. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We may be able to restore the balance here if we're clever. We were just talking about temporarily making the Venonan ill again, as if that cure was only temporary. Is it possible that we could seed an idea into some of the more restless Venonan so they decide to take the solution into their own hands instead of just accepting faith? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You are the counselor.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or, Dr. Zerra beams down and starts violently terrorizing the village until they rise up and defeat him with their wits and courage<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I typically operate with consent<br />
**T'Kor:** What if they just start praying?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't care how you do it, you must make them stop praying.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well they think you're god, so I guess you terrorize them too?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** That is a horrible plan, I should have you brought up on charges for suggesting it<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** At least Murry's plan isn't a crime<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you<br />
*Hailey Murry beams at the praise*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Alternatively, we can simply leave. This isn't our problem and we aren't required to do anything here. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Here, I can't really help in your play-acting, but I can offer special effects. <br />
*Hailey Murry makes notes for Viraseti's sessions later*<br />
>Zox and Skig explain their plan to to the Captain to have Zerra be "killed" by mosters played by Throk and Zox, and then have the monsters be killed by the locals<br />

**T'Kor:** Excuse me, why is "killed" not in quotes at hte end? I harbor some concerns<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** As a precaution, we should set down some transporter beacons in the area, such that if anything should happen, crew member can be recovered.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We will maintain a transporter lock on you<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This plan does results in fewer moral conundrums for Dr Zerra than the "shoot a lot of them with a Type-2 Phaser" that someone else was suggesting he do.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Right, but with the strange disruptions and the large energy source, it wouldn't hurt to have some support, no?<br />
**Throk:** Throk knows Dr Zerra can find nugget of evil in his heart and let it bloom.<br />

**Throk:** Throk realizes this plan has high chance of his death, but it is risk he is willing to take for good of Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it'd be a better idea to take a more subtle approach. Disguise some of us as travelling Venonans, then mingle with the group and stoke some of the concerns and inflate their conspiracy thoeries. Gaslight them so they don't believe in the recent events, helped by temporarily re-poisoning some of them. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That only works in an advanced civilization you are trying to destabilize. <br />

*Throk wishes Throk was not such a good ventriloquist.*<br />
*Kolea wishes Throk was not such a good ventriloquist.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I am inclined to agree with Zox, I think this is our best option<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We will make it so!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Just need some holograms to give this act a little bit of a surreal quality and we are good to go<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Prepare to beam down an away team to carry out the plan, I will go let the Xepai know to observe <br />
*Cmdr Bachar buries her head in her hands*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Out of curiosity, could we possibly just... interfere with the version of events the Xepai see by manipulating their data feeds to show what we need them to see and then retcon events as necessary to ensure the survival of the Venonans?<br />
**Ishemok:** This is just a degenerate form of salesmanship!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That way when we inevitably botch something, it will not be broadcast live and make us look even worse to the Xepai?<br />
**Ishemok:** But I like the way you are applying practical business and advertising skills to fostering inter-species peace.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** After all, the Xepai are the ones we need to impress as a fellow spacefaring species if we wish to engage and improve the results so Starfleet Command is pleased with the outcome of our first contact situation with them?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We could attempt it, but if we are detected it could jeapordize Starfleet/Xepai relations<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True. Just a suggestion, intercultural things are not what I'm here for.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think they'll definitely discover that charade, sooner rather than later, but definitely later as well. The town's plan is to spread the word of their deities far and wide, so we'd have to address that as well in every town the Xepai monitor<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Fair enough, just putting ideas on the table.<br />
*Kolea is impressed Skig was awake long enough to make a coherent, if flawed, suggestion.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That is a good point, if we trick them and the contamination is allowed to spread, they may end up wiping out even more villages later when they discover<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, then I shall work on making sure we don't mess up and put on the best show possible for the Xepai and the Venonans.<br />
*Skig goes to find all manner of engineering shenanigans to minimise casualties and help out with THIS WEEK'S CRAZY PLAN.*<br />
*Throk begins bench pressing a small starship to get ready for combat.*<br />

**Venonan Villager:** Perhaps Nanon didn't forsake us, our priestess just earned his ire<br />
**Tabak:** You just assume this creature is Nanon, as did I at one time, but does he speak like Nanon? Does he command from on-high with the authority of the open flame?<br />

**T'Kor:** Then perhaps you should be trying me. <br />
**Tabak:** If you are truly Nanon, Pinek will walk from the flames. If you are not, she will perish and I will walk free<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Maybe you should go find out? Investigate? <br />
**Saset:** Yes, and spread the word of what happened here and the teachings of The Zerra<br />
**Throk:** Throk have brilliant idea.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Unpopular opinion: I say we let the Xepai kill 'em, these people are infuriating<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok Throkk. You got a plan? Show me your zen-master wisdom.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Shut up Lieutenant.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think they should engage in inter-village school exchange between children.<br />
**Throk:** Allow wisdom to be learned through educational teachings of the young.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay, you read one too many camp pamplets and not one too many religious texts...<br />
**Throk:** Also, will let children have chance to escape village before Xepai nuke it.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Any better ideas?<br />
**Throk:** Throk have second plan?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Would it work to slant this not as their village being saved, but as theirs being the *last* to be saved? The only one that had to be "saved"?<br />
**Throk:** Use holoprojectors and Starfleet personnel to create illusionary merchant caravan who rejects all of their teachings and offers alternate view based on scientific research and theory, then encourage them to throw off yoke of vile T'Kor worship.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok - Im beaming down in 5 minutes. Security Team Reptar, secure a perimiter around the village maintaining clandestine protocol, phasers set to stun.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I had something a little more....apocalyptic than a merchant caravan, Throk.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But the idea is the same<br />
*Zox'xar the Annhilator Beams down, with fireworks, eclipses, the whole nine yards.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk not sure this good idea, but....<br />
*Throk beams down 200 kg of popcorn.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Just for your information, there's a rather large supply of oil and combustables in one of those buildings. It's the one due east of the pyre, the small one. It probably has Venonans running toward or away from it, depending on how on fire the building is. <br />

*Hailey Murry offers a glass of wine to Captain Baras (presuming he's smart enough to have not eaten anything Throk gave him)*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Perhaps we should beam out before we make things worse?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Agreed, let's beam them out before the fire reaches the fuel<br />
**Throk:** That would be a good idea, but I'm not sure how we could make it worse than it currently is.<br />
