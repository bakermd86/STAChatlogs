>Captains Log, Stardate 61924.5: Our survey of the dwarf bodies of the D'Navel system was uneventful, and we are currently en route to our rendezvous with the science vessel USS Maxwel in three daysl to resupply them with long-range survey equipment.

>After that resupply, we should have at least a week before we need to be at the geoengineering conference on Tenaxia VI. I have asked the senior staff to go over the data we have and figure out what we should prioritize during that week. I want to make sure we make good use of the time we have available.<br />

>INTERIOR - Conference Room: Murry has wheeled her conspiracy board back out so the crew can decide what their next priority should be.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Okay, so what leads do we have?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well T'Kor has those coordinates that the Twins were communicating with<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I finished launching the Diplomatic Suites debris into the star the Dwarf bodies were orbiting. It turns out all those plastic planters, tacky decor, motivational posters, and decorative chairs were disguising some really good research equipment.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** We also have this datapad that the Twins gave us from the Cardassian Embassy<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Does that have a DB-9 serial port?<br />
*Skig looks at the datapad.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Didn't the Trill give us a lead where the old Lieutenant guy was going?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Anchovy Pizza or something.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** No wait... Antin IV.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, looks like that is a planet in T'Zenkethi space, near the Romulan border<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The coordinates from T'Kor are on a Federation planet, Ariadne Opan III<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Likely it is easier to find T'Kor's coordinates than a well trained Federation operative who is on an unknown operation.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That would be testable by referencing the names against ship registries.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I know a couple of these names, the Telek and Roral are Keldon class Cardassian heavy cruisers<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Why would the Twins send us a bunch of Cardassian warp signature spectra?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, the Cardassians were being cryptically threatening....but that's hard to differentiate from baseline.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** There was a Cardassian at the gun exchange as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I suspect they may have a similar espionage issue as we do<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Oh wait, I almost forgot after all the chaos at Starfleet Medical... <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Tracking and filtering out warp signatures for a select group of ships is a way to get  them through security checkpoints. Or faking them through a security checkpoint when they are not there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I do have the warp signature from the black hole that I had been working on. The base signature was fake, but the secondary and tertiary harmonics matched a Cardassian warp signature<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh, that's interesting. One of these?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The Roral perhaps, which Malat told us is a Keldon Class Heavy Cruiser<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well add that to list, we can go track down these Cardassians<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** So what do we tell the Captain? Antin IV, Ariadne Opan III, or track down the Roral?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I sort of want to beat up Sam.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** He clearly knows too much!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I don't think we'd catch him<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Aside that, what do we do if we catch him? He's a Star Fleet officer<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Invite him to a ball!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I think it would be pretty fun to try though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Also, I am not sure I want to run the risk of the Lister getting into combat with a Cardassian Heavy Cruiser.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, given how labrinthine this is, Ariadne is the best place to go.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Ariadne it is then<br />
>Suddenly, Captain Bachar's voice pops in through the comms<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Senior staff report to the bridge, we have a situation<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Wheee!<br />
*Skig duitfully heads to the bridge, happy that when the captain states "situation" it does not mean, "the replicator gave me orange juice and I asked for grapefuit juice".*<br />
>INTERIOR - Bridge: As the senior staff depart the turbolift, Bachar and Windbloom call them over from the aft comms station where they are both looking at a display<br />

*Skig heads over to see what is going on.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** We are picking up a faint distress call from the Omarian cluster<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Very weak, looks like it's probably like... an emergency beacon<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** No details on the situation, but we should probably check it out<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Are the shields modulated according the posted frequencies?<br />
*Skig gets out convenient starmap to see if that is in the direction we want to go in or not.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Right away sir.<br />
*Skig reconsiders the Advanced Research Labs for the Sensor Suites, but it is too late now.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** It was the strangest thing. We were attacked, so we surrendered assuming they would take our load of dilithium ore<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** But instead, they just came over and started pulling out all of the wiring from our power grid<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** They stripped away all of the wire insulating and took it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Krepeka.png" alt="Krepeka" width="50" height="50">**Krepeka** Did you consider ramming them at warp speed prior to surrender?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** No, we are mostly ok it is just our power grid that is damaged<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** They only fired one shot before we surrendered. This is a bulk ore carrier, we are no match for a Klingon cruiser, even one as old as a D7<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Those materials are nothing compared to this material<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** And you would have sent us away<br />

>INTERIOR - Bridge: Dr. Malov's ship comes into visual range and appears on the viewscreen. The name has been changed since last you saw it, as it is now emblazoned with the name "Means of Production." Moments later, the familiar face of Dr. Malov appears on the screen.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Let me just first start by offering my sincere apology about that whole kidnapping affair the last time we met<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** You have to understand that, as union president, I am sworn to faithfully execute the will of the union body in the execution of my dutires<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** You'll be pleased to know that union membership has grown significantly since then and the union no longer predominantly focuses on criminal activity<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** We are presently engaged in a large-scale industrial action.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Did the Nausicaans overthrow you?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** No, many of the original crew have left but some chose to stay behind in exchange for receiving a comfortable percentage of union dues as a salary in exchange for their vital security services<br />
*Skig decides to address the situation by remaining in the cargo bay and teaching the Pakleds about the dangers of electrocution.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm glad it sounds like things are looking better, though it sounds like the struggle is ongoing. We're a little more concerned with that ship of Pakleds...<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Guys, do we have a personal cult army right now?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Ah yes, the Pakleds only recently joined the union. They were enthusiastic, but they seem to have misunderstood several important points<br />
*Throk walks past the view screen chewing on Pakled entrails.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Quite. I hope there's no hard feelings about us breaking out of your ship? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** None at all, I personally was never in favor of kidnapping as a source of funding<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What sort of business production have you taken up?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** We have established a much more regularlized system of union dues paid by our members to fund our operation. We do not directly engage in commerce as a union of course, our budget is used to support union members in their negotiations with management <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Who are the management?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The Pakleds, for instance, had been tricked into signing exploitative labor contracts in which they were being paid only in the form of worthless trilitium geodes that would be produced as a mining biproduct.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Somehow the mine management had tricked them into thinking the geodes were rare and valuable.<br />
*Throk has a new Value for this episode.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): That which you cannot eat strengthens your jaw</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I see. I might recommend that they be provided union representation to aid them in their negotiations in the future. And perhaps a few minders, to help keep an eye on them. They were raiding ships for electrical insulation <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): There might be a translation error with this famous Gorn saying.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, perhaps you didn't quite impart the lesson, prof...yes that.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Well as I said, they misunderstood some key points. But they are not the only workers involved in this strike<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh quite. I might suggest that they're not quite at the level to look after their own affairs<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Wait, which strike?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The mining consortium has refused to negotiate new contract terms, so we have enacted a sector-wide picket line to obstruct the mine's operations<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Picket Line? Why do I suspect there is a line of sentry ships attacking cargo vessels?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Yes, the Pakleds were supposed to stop those ore tenders and destroy their cargo, not strip their power systems of insulation<br />
*Kolea is worried Dr Malov's efforts are being miscontrued.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** They left the cargo, I'm afraid<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The GORMAS is blocking mine operations throughout this sector, and will continue until management agrees to better contract terms<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Can you forward over your contract terms? I'm curious what you've whipped up. <br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Every other gimmick goes into the rabbit hole and returns. Legalese? Well F that. Bless you Fen.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** That is the problem: management has thus far refused to negotiate with the union at all<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Who are the mining consortium out here?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** "K'Mot's Jewels." They are an FCA-licensed inter-jurisdictional consortium<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** When the work force agreed to unionize, they fried everyone and replaced the entire workforce with new workers or automated robots <br />

<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** for whatever reason, management has been completely unwilling to even open negotiations<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How much difficulty did they have in finding new workers?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** I don't know whether it was difficult for them, but it didn't take them very long<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** We have intercented hundreds of ships as part of our strike though, so the operation must be costing them tens of thousands of bars of latinum<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Hm. That's interesting. Would you like us to reach out on your behalf to see if we can open negotiations? <br />

>INTERIOR - Cargo Bay 3: By the time T'Kor, Zox and Malat get to the cargo bay and join Skig, the Pakleds appear to have extensively decorated the cargo bay with long strings of exposed electrical cable, sparking against the hull plating. In the corner of the cargo bay, they have set up a large conical shaped pile of wiring and metal plates which appears to be connected to the secondary of a tesla coil. It is flashing brightly with huge, high-frequency electrical arcs all around it<br />

**Ensign Ghex (Comms)** Yes ma'am, I'm here. Just working. I had a few calibration tasks that needed to be done, and I figure that it was a good time to do it because we are in orbit and we are not planning to leave anytime soon you know? Are leaving soon? I may have to finish this calibration later and bring the navigational sensors back online if we need to break orbit<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** We didn't have any official boarding parties, the captain would have had to approve any visitors since this is not a Starfleet outpost. So per regulations, the captain would have to give approval to anyone coming on board. The pakleds did bring some supplies on board with permission for "religious purposes" but to be honest, I think this religion is kind of a bunch of made up nonsense. Although, I guess in a sense, all religions are made up so maybe it isn't really that different<br />

>INTERIOR - Jeffries Tube: Geret leads Skig and the rest of the team through the Jeffries tube with her nose, tracking the mysterious primate odor all the way to a service junction near the hull. There, they see a large Gorilla-like alien carrying Dr. Malov, standing near the entrance of a boarding pod lodged in the hull.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Kaglor see that Skig is very smart, understands all of the machines. But Skig does not understand the people. Kaglor likes to talk to people, so Kaglor make manual for Skig. Now Skig can be better commander.<br />

*Zox attempts to emote, but can't*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm.... this seems incredibly insightful. Thank you.<br />
>Captain Kaglor confidently walks under the tree and opens a small box containing a small quartz glass vial hanging on a necklace that appears to be empy inside.<br />

*Captain Kaglor looks confused*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: More confused than normal, anyways</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** It's nothing. Like, not "nothing" but actually nothing. I can explain: so, I know how much you like dielectric materials, so I looked up on the computer what was the strongest dielectric insulator. Turns out, it is pure vacuum. It has a dielectric breakdown voltage of 10^27 volts / cm. So I replicated a super strong quartz glass vial and exposed it to pure interplanetary vacuum. So it's a vial of nearly pure "nothing"<br />
*Captain Kaglor starts to tear up*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Thank you, tiny blue girl<br />
>Ensign Ghex darts wuickly under the tree and returns with a small jewelry box. Inside she finds a pin in the shape of a stylized pair of wings. It is made out of silver, and appears to have been crafted by hand using very old-school techniques.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** A little affectation from a part of my life that was... Well, it was a long time ago. I got those when I learned to fly primitive aircraft, a far cry from piloting the Lister. But... ahem, let's not get too sentimental. Who's next?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Oh right, it's me...<br />
>Captain Bachar deftly grabs a narrow, tall box from under the tree. She opens it to find a potted plant.<br />

>Geret has a coughing fit, and her Bajoran skin flies off as she explodes into a cloud of roiling energy<br />

*Skig wondiers if we can solve multiple problems by having Skig exclaim that Geret has transcended and become the Pakled's deity.*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Geret): OwO. Am I the spirit of Resistmas?</font><br />
>Gra'lan ducks under the tree and finds a small box containing  an old storage device and what appear to be several folded up posters from classical entertainment, presumably contained on the storage device too. Vintage copies of several movies, including "Batteries Not Included", "Back to the Future", "The Last Star Fighter", and others.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Gra'lan.png" alt="Gra'lan" width="50" height="50">**Gra'lan** Oh wow! They don't make em like this anymore! Yall call this camp, but it was _culture_. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Wow, those will work on the Betamax player hooked up to the Cathode Ray Tubes in Auxiliary Generator Room C!<br />
>Oakadan next shimmies under the branches of the Resistmas tree to retrieve a surprisingly heavy cylinder. Inside he finds a K-Type fire extinguisher, rated for all classes of fire up-to and including plasma... wrapped in a layer of bacon<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** I'm glad it appeals to you. I wasn't sure what sort of gadgets to get you that would work well with your office, so I figured I'd get some of the classic shows featuring more nostalgic tech<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** Thank you,  Throk<br />
>He notices under the original fire safety label it has been scratched off, and a new label written that says "Contains Sriracha"<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk like chewy on the outside and crunchy on the inside parts.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** This is... very much non-edible<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** It not?<br />
>Throk pushes the branches out of his way to grab a large basked wrapped in foil. He opens it to find a wicker basket packed with various small items in a bed of straw. A bottle of lavender oil, a few candles, an isolinear chip, a small speaker, a hypospray, an eye mask, and a handwritten card that reads "Violence does not solve problems, it only creates new ones" on the front.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk wondering if maybe he should cut back then.<br />
>Windbloom next slips past the branches and retrieves a weighty package. Inside, he finds a couple of bottles of fine, aged, single-malt scotch<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk very grateful for opportunity to learn new ways to not have Captain be mad at him.<br />
>Murry gingerly picks out a tall carboard cylinder with her name on it. Inside, she finds a bottle of Kanar. The label is from a very rare and expensive bottler, and it indicates a vintage of around 50 years ago, although it is hard to make out as the outside of the bottle is covered in dried Cardassian blood.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I got that on Bajor when I was a kid. I was smuggling weapons into Rakantha province, landed my transport near the site where I was due to meet my contact. Before I could make the rendezvous, I stumbled on a Cardassian officer walking towards the river with a picnic basket. We struggled, he went for his phaser, so I grabbed the bottle from his basket and beat his head in with it. I was so shaken, I kept the bottle in my hand the whole time as I ran back to my transport.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** When I got back to my resistance cell, I found out the Cardassian I killed was Gul Ishak, the commandant of the Kolaakor death camp. Suddenly, I was a resistance hero of sorts. The 12 year old kid that killed the Butcher of Kolaakor with her bare hands... Well... That was a long time ago, it's probably time I moved on. Besides, I can't stomach the stuff, so I may as well give it to someone that will enjoy it.<br />
*Zox would be clapping for our new security chef, but can't even move his claws.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I appreciate it, Malat. Thank you.<br />
*Geret mingles among hte crowd as a Santa would at a Christmas party.*<br />
>Malat carefully pulls an envelope out from under the tree, and finds four tickets inside to an orbital racing series taking place later in the year in orbit above Bajor. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Wait, Throk wonder where Kolea gift is?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Throk, sometimes, the best gift someone can get is to see other people be happy.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Merry Resistmas everyone! <br />
>Captain Kaglor pulls a lever near the tree, causing a panel on the wall to fall away and revealing that the Pakleds have (once again) tapped into the ship's EPS high-power system without permission. As the circuit closes, the Lister's full main power rushes through the Resistmas tree, flooding the entire room with painfully bright light and massive, painful electrical arcs<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Wheeee!<br />
