**Hailey Murry:** Counselor's Log - I only have a moment of peace away from the others. I hope this remains intact after this, though I expect it will not. Still, the act of repeating it will help with retention. The working theory is that the ionic storm is causing us to relive of the USS Lister's battles, a flight from a Cardassian cruiser that left some trauma on Skig. We thought that hindsight would allow a cleaner resolution than in reality, but it appears we only delayed the inevitable and looped back to the beginning. I'm concerned for Skig's wellbeing if we continue to repeat this loop, but I'm more concerned that we won't get the chance. The Cardassian cruiser is now ionized. Things are escalating. End recording.<br />

**Captain Baras:** Counselor, I am not convinced that Skig's efforts with Chief Botok are going to amount to anything<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Neither am I<br />
**Captain Baras:** I want an alternative course of action, thoughts?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** In fact, I think it may wind up being worse for us, given the changes we're seeing on only our second loop<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Zox, what are your thoughts?<br />
*Hailey Murry takes a drink of her coffee as she thinks*<br />
**Zox:** I am not certain. I am not assigned to the security of this vessel at this time.<br />
**Zox:** Perhaps we need to give Skig more fermented beverages such that she mellows our.<br />
**Zox:** ..out and stops having violent recollections and dreams.<br />
**Captain Baras:** So you think a theraputic solution might help?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** It might. Something about learning to let go...<br />
*Hailey Murry sighs*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** But this is very tactile<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Have we tried reaching out to the Cardassian ship to see what it wants?<br />
**Zox:** War.<br />

**Hailey Murry:** Ah, let me rephrease; have we tried reaching out to the ionic storm that's in superposition with the Cardassian ship? <br />
**Zox:** I think you should put mild psychadelics in Skigs food, microdosing.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Interesting idea Counselor. You think we might find someone or something to communicate with?<br />
**Captain Baras:** Ok, if we wanted to attempt communication, how would we do it?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Let's try to reach out to the enemy ship first, see if we can communicate with them through the ship. Pay attention to the static or distortions as well, I can run some scans and see if there are words within the sounds.<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 21]**<br />
**Zox:** With all due respect, I think a state of open war will void any communication unless the Cardassian commander has a will to parley.<br />
**Captain Baras:** So what do you suggest Commander?<br />
**Zox:** Engage in warfare, per the federations current declaration. <br />
**Zox: [ PRESENCE  (10) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 14]**<br />
**Hailey Murry:** The communication does not need to be "meaningful" in the classic sense of the terms. We don't necessarily have to come to peace with the ship, but rather to pick out subtle messages in how they phrase things or voices in the static to clue us into an out.<br />

**Zox:** the only subtle thing about the Cardassians are their poisons.<br />
**Captain Baras:** I think you're both right. We need to attempt communication, but the Cardassian Gul commanding that vessel is not going to engage in a pleasant fireside chat<br />
**Captain Baras:** The only alternative option is to offer our surrender, and discuss terms with him<br />
>♫♫♫Ominous Music Sting♫♫♫<br />

**Zox:** We should be disscussing surrender, theirs, after we use our knowledge of their ship against them.<br />
*Skig speaking to Botok.*<br />
**Zox:** I hope you will enjoy being in an endless dream of dilithium prison mining camp.<br />
>INTERIOR - Engineering: Skig and Botok step off the turbolift to find a scene much like the last time. The chaos of battle rages around them<br />

Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 25]**<br />
**Skig:** I was wondering if you have ever considered the feasibility of a time loop that created by some sort of unresolved spatial anomaly...<br />
**Chief Botok:** I'm afraid my temporal mechanics is a bit rusty. My personal rule with time travel has always been: "Just say no"<br />
**Chief Botok:** Warp engines are a lot simpler<br />
**Skig:** Tural, Botok and I will deal with the Warp Core situation up above, please direct Pedersen to stand in front of panel A5 and cut the Sriracha-Magnum-Flex-Hydrostator to 30% for the Officer's Replicator when I give the signal.<br />
*Skig strides confidently through the chaos like this is something she has seen at least a dozen times before.*<br />
*Tural turns to Skig and emits a high pitch electronic whine*<br />
*Skig stops.*<br />
**Skig:** Hmm...<br />

*Tural speaks a few broken words, scattered with high pitch electrical whine*<br />
**Tural:** Disable..... killing.....power.....response<br />
**Skig:** We can come to that accommodation, but not in our current state. If you can back away and allow us to work in our corporeal forms that will be better.<br />
*Skig ponders if the action of disabling the warp core on the Lister would accomplish the intended effect.*<br />
*Tural stares blankly at Skig for a moment before letting out a rapid series of high pitch interference sounds*<br />

>The entire away team is overcome with a blinding pain as their senses are overwhelmed by the electrical shrieing flooding their ears. Everyone is momentarily blinded, and when it clears, Commander Murry is standing on the bridge, the rest of the away team is unconscious around her<br />

*Zox begins laying eggs.*<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti begins to roll to her feet*<br />
**Skig ***(mutters in her sleep)*: Yes, I would like another Romulan Ale mixer. This is delicious.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** That was almost as unpleasant as when we mixed up the frequencies for the sonic showers<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** This place is not at all conducive to humanoid life<br />

Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
**Hailey Murry:** That definitely came from outside our current predicament. Either directly from the storm or something else interacting with it<br />
**Captain Baras:** Skig, what happened in engineering? We were discussing a plan to attempt to communicate with... whatever it is that is going on here<br />
*Skig wakes up, looks around blearily, stands up and Picard-Maneuvers her shirt back into position.*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): it occurs to me that the best ways to wear pajamas all the time is work for star-fleet, or work from home.</font><br />
**Skig:** The entity was trying to communicate with me using Tural and I was using the universal communicator to try and establish contact, but evidently the response it provided resulted in our loss of consciousness.<br />
**Skig:** Although I'm not sure this is any more conscious than the previous sequence we were observing.<br />
*Zox slams her badge and asks for the startdate.*<br />

*Skig looks around to see if Botok or any of the old Lister-crew is there, or if it is just the Away Team + Anjek.*<br />

**Skig:** Current Lister Bridge or Skig's Memory Lister Bridge?<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Current Lister Bridge or Skig's Memory Lister Bridge?</font><br />
**Hailey Murry:** What did the storm state? <br />
**Skig:** Disable killing power response, with lots of extra static and screeching.<br />
>As the crew contemplate their situation on the bridge, the Cardassian cruiser again emerges from behind the planet, again surrounded by a massive ionic storm<br />

**Hailey Murry:** That...probably has to do with the main plan back in the real world<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Which we're unfortunately sequestered from<br />
**Skig:** I assume the Weather Grid is triggering a response from this entity.<br />
**Skig:** Yes, I was trying to get the entity to leave the area so we could wake up and figure out how to disable the power grid in a way that was not an attack on the entity itself.<br />
**Zox:** I refuse to believe that a planet has brought problems upon itself and we alone can show them a solution. It seems too simple.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Interesting, Zox attempt to raise the cardassian vessel as we discussed<br />
**Zox:** You got it!<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
**Skig:** Something about this situation reminded me of the Enterprise experience with the discovery of the Horta in the mining colony, where the miners were unintentionally destroying the eggs and provoked a response from the parent.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Does this mean the entity is tied into the power grid now? <br />
**Skig:** Or the power grid is seen as a hostile force by the entity, and it is escalating back and forth between upgrades and responses and finally brought about a situation where we could make contact.<br />
>A grim looking Cardassian appears on the viewscreen<br />

**Zox:** Channel has been opened.<br />
**Skig:** At least, that is my take based on reading reports from previous Starfleet encounters similar in nature. And perhaps a little too much free time in the holodeck lately.<br />
*Zox plugs his sensitive hearing holes with wax*<br />
**Captain Baras:** This is Captain Baras of the USS Lister, we would like to signal our surrender and discuss terms<br />
*Skig remembers to schedule taking down Holodeck 4 for "maintenance" when she needs to de-stress by simulating previous Starfleet After-Action-Reports.*<br />
*Cardassian Gul emits another series of screeching sounds*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** It's not going to help, Zox, the sound is directly to the ear drums. Possibly to the sensory sentor of the brain directly<br />
*Skig uses Universal Translator to get an idea what is being communicated.*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Does the universal translator work on Gul?<br />
**Skig: [ REASON  (10) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]

[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]
Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 3]**<br />
*Zox can't hear Hailey*<br />
*Skig fixes several algorithmic issues with the Universal Translator, develops a new programming language hooking to the API, and files a half dozen patents in Chief Botok's name for upgrades to the Universal Translator. Then takes the remaining 30 seconds of that minute off to think about warp field dynamics.*<br />
>As Skig manipulates the translator, the voice from the Cardassian Gul slowly modulates from painful electronic interference into a familiar voice...<br />

<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Majel Barrett?</font><br />
**Commander Bachar:** I repeat: To anyone on the away team that can hear me, you need to disable the weather control grid. You lifesigns are fading, the radiation at your location is killing you. You need to cut all power to the weather control grid so we can obtain a transporter lock. We will repeat every minute until we get your response.<br />
**Zox:** Skig, the one item that has followed us in all these dream sequences is the emitter; if we find it here can you hotwire it to disable the entire network?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** This is part of the original message we got earlier<br />
**Skig:** No problem.<br />
*Skig looks for a suspiciously emitter sized object.*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Commander Bachar, we copy your message, do you read this transmission?<br />
**Skig:** Technically she would hear it.<br />
**Skig:** Unless she is getting it transcribed for some reason.<br />
*Cardassian Gul stares blankly at the screen like a confused bird*<br />
*Skig gets out a cunieform tablet and makes a copy of Bachar's message and hands it to the captain.*<br />
**Skig:** I have copied it for you.<br />
*Zox locates the emitter device.*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Counselor, I am concerned that Skig's mental state is deteriorating<br />

**Zox:** Quickly Skig.<br />
**Skig:** Right-o!<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Duly noted, Captain, but I think she's still good for now. <br />

>Skig opens the music box to investigate it, and it appears to be a completely ordinary music box. Just a few springs and gears, and a metal drum with bumps on it<br />

**Zox:** Hrm.<br />
>When she opens it, a mournful song begins to play<br />

<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Can she spin the tumblers to make it play faster?</font><br />
*Skig adjusts it to 10x speed to see if getting to the end of the song causes power to stop, or if she just needs to apply a hammer.*<br />

**Skig:** This is the song we played at Tural's funeral, mostly because nothing else was working on the Lister at the time. Weird how the music box would pick that one.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Oh no, the Cardassian ship is moving much faster<br />
**Zox:** Perhaps it is not the key to switching off the network.<br />
**Skig:** And then it was stuck in a loop and I was too busy keeping the ship operational, so this song was flooded on all the decks for about a week.<br />
**Skig:** I hate this song.<br />

>As Skig destroys the music box, the ship rocks violently and the red alert klaxon begins to blare<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'm reading a sudden loss of anti-matter containment in the warp core<br />
**Skig:** Good.<br />
**Skig:** Eject the core<br />

**Skig:** I was thinking of just ejecting it back in engineering the second time around.<br />

**Skig:** I don't remember the Lister warp core having such a nice collection of red and blue lights, but the fat human guy in the sleigh being carried by the four-legged animals is a nice touch. I assume that is Pedersen's doing.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** It seems like...a sphere. I think something's in it?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** I can't see it clearly<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Anjek, come over here. Do you recognize that?<br />
*Skig turns her head ninety degress to the side.*<br />
**Anjek:** No, I have never seen anything like that.<br />
**Anjek:** I have no idea what that is<br />
**Skig:** Zox, if you look at it from a perpendicular angle, it kind of looks like the cross between a Antivuian Muskrat and a Romulan Pain Dome.<br />
*Anjek tugs at her collar*<br />
*Zox squints at Skig.*<br />
**Skig:** No, the thing floating outside, not me.<br />
**Zox:** Yes, but didn't that come from your memory?<br />

>Zox pulls up a close-up of the object on screen, and it is now clearly a large transparent sphere. Inside, there seems to be a small collection of ionic clouds flashing with small bursts of lightning<br />

**Skig:** Umm.... at the risk of sounding truly insane... Any one else feel like they are looking at baby ion storms?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Well, I'm at a loss<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Skig, ion storms don't have babies<br />
**Zox:** That is a good read of the metaphor Skig.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Isn't that right, Anjek?<br />
**Skig:** Refer back to earlier comment about Kirk's experience with the Horta.<br />
*Skig looks at Anjek.*<br />
**Anjek:** Why should I know anything about the situation? We're in your furry friend's head<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Yeah, but Skig's head didn't have any ion storms, those are intruding from outside<br />
*Anjek backs away from the away team*<br />
