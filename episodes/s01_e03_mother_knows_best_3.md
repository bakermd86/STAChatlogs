<font color="##261A12">Zox: Im taking my crew down these auxiliary shafts.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Well, on the plus side we really don't need to inspect down there…wait, where did Zox go?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">The away team soon rounds a corner to find Commander Zox wrapped up by a large snake-like creature emerging from a hole in the shaft wall.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Kolea: I've had fantasies about things like this!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox bashes the snake against the rocks, tearing open its flesh and releasing still more gas</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Commander Murry to Lister, we need two things. We need to be beamed out. And we should pretend this was a resounding success.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig materializes Zox in the containment system.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dr. Zerra: It looks like something is… rewriting the Commander's DNA</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dr. Zerra: I have one hope for a treatment: a live donor. According to your personel file, your Mother lives on a colony less than 12 light years from here</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: I...feel a little lightheaded and weak. Like I want to sleep on a heat rock, but more than normal.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox starts coughing and an eruption of gas begins to spew from his mouth</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Brwaarrrrrrghhrrrrf</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Murry tries to pull Dr. Zerra to safety, but gets her arm tangled in Zox's belt and all three of them fall to the ground in a pile</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Hailey, you were supposed to pull away, not towards.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig transports Murry out of the forcefield, setting it for a full infection scan to make sure she is not infected with the same thing Zox has.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: Zox, are you OK in there? The atmostphere in there reads as highly toxic, but your life signs are stable.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dr. Zerra: Your alveoli appear to be binding with the flourine in the gas.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry chills in her containment field, listening into the discussion via her comms</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dr. Zerra: Commander Murry I have some good new and some… odd news. The good news is that you don't seem to have any genetic damage.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Dr. Zerra pulls up a scan of a clutch of eggs in Commander Murry's abdomen</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry steps up to look through the field in horror</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Congratulations!</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: Not again</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Just then, Captain Baras enters Sickbay with an older Voth female</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Rhuk: What are you hiding from me?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: I'm not hiding anything, really, I just don't want you to worry about things that we don't have to worry about</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Malat: It's just getting to the good part, I want to see how Murry explains the Voth eggs in her belly</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Who am I to question what the Counselor and Chief of Security do in their “free” time?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Rhuk: What what? Voth eggs in that small creature?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Hailey Murry: It was via the transporters. It has to have been.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Rhuk: Iss that what they are calling it now?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dr. Zerra: I didn't think to check the first time, I just assumed… But these eggs don't seem to contain any of the Counselor's DNA</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Dr. Zerra: I think they need a little privacy to discuss their options</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">And now... the conclusion</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">♫♫♫Dramatic Music String♫♫♫</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Captains Log, supplemental: Murry and Zox are both in stable condition for now. Dr. Zerra is continue Zox's treatment, but is still investigating a safe procedure to remove the... lifeforms from Counselor Murry. In the meantime, I ordered both of them to take some time off. Zox has been spending some time with his mother, and Counselor Murry seems to be hiding from her in Holodeck 4. Just to be on the safe side, I've ordered the transporters shut down until we understand what happened. Skig is leading the investigation in transporter room 2.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">INTERIOR - Transporter Room 2: Skig has torn the transporter pad down to its frame looking for the cause of the malfunction that definitely couldn't have possibly been user error in any way and MUST have absolutely been a malfunction, 100%. She's not projecting, you're projecting.</font><br />

<font color="##660066"> -&gt; Skig: All of the transporter systems seem to be working correctly, but you notice something strange in the bio logs. When you beamed up Zox the first time, the biofilter screened out some unidentified foreign biological material. That material was never rematerialized, but the biofilter is empty now for some reason. Skig can't account for where it went.</font><br />

<font color="##660066">Skig: For momentum, could she determine if it is trapped in a transporter buffer "somewhere" or it just "vanished" into nonexistence?</font><br />

<font color="##261A12">Rhuk: Wait, do huumans really do...that through their noses?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Apparently yes. I had no idea really!</font><br />
<font color="##660066"> -&gt; Skig: Skig can't immediately see any evidnce of them anywhere, but also can't entirely rule out that the patterns could have been materialized somewhere</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: No, I don't think that is possible</font><br />
<font color="##660066">Skig: So they could have rematerialized inside Murry during the emergency transport?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: I am still fairly certain that the transporter is responsible and not any ordinary biological contamination</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Zox makes confused reptile noises.</font><br />
<font color="##660066"> -&gt; Skig: entirely possible, but Skig has not found any evidence to support that yet</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Oakadan: I'll have to second that</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Then...can't we just reverse this problem?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Oakadan: Wouldn't that cause her to make you pregnant? </font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Dr. Zerra is still working on it, we aren't sure how to remove the eggs just yet</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Beam the eggs out of Murry and into you? I think there is some sort of ethical discussion that needs to happen by people who care about biological processes.</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Rhuk is confused and not really sure if her son had a fling or not.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Also, the eggs are mostly alien DNA. I don't know that would be wise</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Do we not have some sort of incubator? Can we not Engineer one?</font><br />
<font color="##880000">Skig shows Viraseti some data she found.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Oakadan: Hmmm, we may want to get one ready just in case</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: It can't be safe for those to be in a person.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: I think there was some sort of residual biological material trapped in the transporter filter and it might have mixed with Murry's DNA during the emergency transport.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: This would not happen normally, as it should have been cycled into the normal transporter process for review prior to materialization.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: At least, that's my current hypothesis.</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Yes, the transporter biofilter safeties should have prevented that</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: If this contaminant evaded the biofilter, it may not be safe to use the transporter until we can ensure it is completely eradicated</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Oakadan: Is there something currently trapped in the transporter's biofilter? </font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: This reminds me of the prank that Ensign Peterson pulled where he had every female who used the transporter on odd numbered days and even numbered hours to suddenly develop "D Cups".</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Hrm...Would it be possible to use a shuttle's transporter bay?</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Good thinking, the shuttle systems are isolated from the Lister</font><br />
<font color="##000066">Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: They shouldn't have been infected</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: But I agree, Lt Cmdr, until we can be certain that somehow this is not replicating to everyone who has used the transporter, we should not use them until we can run a full diagnostic.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Yes, the shuttles run a separate transporter grid.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Oakadan): Oh no, is the Lister pregnant as well? </font><br />
<font color="##880000">Skig pulls up a list of everyone who has gone through the transporter since Murry's "accident".</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: No time to waste! A standard bio-reactor should be close enough for those eggs.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Hmm... we should check to see if Rhuk is pregnant with these eggs also.</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Zox: Skig, would you lend me a hand on this real quick?</font><br />
<font color="##261A12">Skig: Oh sure.</font><br />

<font color="##660066">Hailey Murry: Okay, she'll leave it then since things can't leave the Holodeck. Assuming Rhuk is a normal old person and takes the turbolift places, she's been using the long way to travel without being found. So she heads to the stairs and begins heading up to the bridge. Comms are still down?</font><br />
