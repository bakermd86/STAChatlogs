**Zox:** Im taking my crew down these auxiliary shafts.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Well, on the plus side we really don't need to inspect down there…wait, where did Zox go?<br />
>The away team soon rounds a corner to find Commander Zox wrapped up by a large snake-like creature emerging from a hole in the shaft wall.<br />

**Kolea:** I've had fantasies about things like this!<br />
>Zox bashes the snake against the rocks, tearing open its flesh and releasing still more gas<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Commander Murry to Lister, we need two things. We need to be beamed out. And we should pretend this was a resounding success.<br />
>Skig materializes Zox in the containment system.<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** It looks like something is… rewriting the Commander's DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I have one hope for a treatment: a live donor. According to your personel file, your Mother lives on a colony less than 12 light years from here<br />
**Zox:** I...feel a little lightheaded and weak. Like I want to sleep on a heat rock, but more than normal.<br />
>Zox starts coughing and an eruption of gas begins to spew from his mouth<br />

**Zox:** Brwaarrrrrrghhrrrrf<br />
>Murry tries to pull Dr. Zerra to safety, but gets her arm tangled in Zox's belt and all three of them fall to the ground in a pile<br />

**Skig:** Hailey, you were supposed to pull away, not towards.<br />
>Skig transports Murry out of the forcefield, setting it for a full infection scan to make sure she is not infected with the same thing Zox has.<br />

**Lt. Malat:** Zox, are you OK in there? The atmostphere in there reads as highly toxic, but your life signs are stable.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Your alveoli appear to be binding with the flourine in the gas.<br />
>Hailey Murry chills in her containment field, listening into the discussion via her comms<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Commander Murry I have some good new and some… odd news. The good news is that you don't seem to have any genetic damage.<br />
>Dr. Zerra pulls up a scan of a clutch of eggs in Commander Murry's abdomen<br />

>Hailey Murry steps up to look through the field in horror<br />

**Zox:** Congratulations!<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Not again<br />
>Just then, Captain Baras enters Sickbay with an older Voth female<br />

**Rhuk:** What are you hiding from me?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I'm not hiding anything, really, I just don't want you to worry about things that we don't have to worry about<br />
**Lt. Malat:** It's just getting to the good part, I want to see how Murry explains the Voth eggs in her belly<br />
**Skig:** Who am I to question what the Counselor and Chief of Security do in their “free” time?<br />
**Rhuk:** What what? Voth eggs in that small creature?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It was via the transporters. It has to have been.<br />
**Rhuk:** Iss that what they are calling it now?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I didn't think to check the first time, I just assumed… But these eggs don't seem to contain any of the Counselor's DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I think they need a little privacy to discuss their options<br />
>And now... the conclusion<br />

>♫♫♫Dramatic Music String♫♫♫<br />

>Captains Log, supplemental: Murry and Zox are both in stable condition for now. Dr. Zerra is continue Zox's treatment, but is still investigating a safe procedure to remove the... lifeforms from Counselor Murry. In the meantime, I ordered both of them to take some time off. Zox has been spending some time with his mother, and Counselor Murry seems to be hiding from her in Holodeck 4.
 Just to be on the safe side, I've ordered the transporters shut down until we understand what happened. Skig is leading the investigation in transporter room 2.<br />

>INTERIOR - Transporter Room 2: Skig has torn the transporter pad down to its frame looking for the cause of the malfunction that definitely couldn't have possibly been user error in any way and MUST have absolutely been a malfunction, 100%. She's not projecting, you're projecting.<br />

**Rhuk:** Wait, do huumans really do...that through their noses?<br />
**Zox:** Apparently yes. I had no idea really!<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No, I don't think that is possible<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am still fairly certain that the transporter is responsible and not any ordinary biological contamination<br />
*Zox makes confused reptile noises.*<br />
**Oakadan:** I'll have to second that<br />
**Zox:** Then...can't we just reverse this problem?<br />
**Oakadan:** Wouldn't that cause her to make you pregnant? <br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Dr. Zerra is still working on it, we aren't sure how to remove the eggs just yet<br />
**Skig:** Beam the eggs out of Murry and into you? I think there is some sort of ethical discussion that needs to happen by people who care about biological processes.<br />
*Rhuk is confused and not really sure if her son had a fling or not.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Also, the eggs are mostly alien DNA. I don't know that would be wise<br />
**Zox:** Do we not have some sort of incubator? Can we not Engineer one?<br />
*Skig shows Viraseti some data she found.*<br />
**Oakadan:** Hmmm, we may want to get one ready just in case<br />
**Zox:** It can't be safe for those to be in a person.<br />
**Skig:** I think there was some sort of residual biological material trapped in the transporter filter and it might have mixed with Murry's DNA during the emergency transport.<br />
**Skig:** This would not happen normally, as it should have been cycled into the normal transporter process for review prior to materialization.<br />
**Skig:** At least, that's my current hypothesis.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, the transporter biofilter safeties should have prevented that<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If this contaminant evaded the biofilter, it may not be safe to use the transporter until we can ensure it is completely eradicated<br />
**Oakadan:** Is there something currently trapped in the transporter's biofilter? <br />
**Skig:** This reminds me of the prank that Ensign Peterson pulled where he had every female who used the transporter on odd numbered days and even numbered hours to suddenly develop "D Cups".<br />
**Zox:** Hrm...Would it be possible to use a shuttle's transporter bay?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good thinking, the shuttle systems are isolated from the Lister<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They shouldn't have been infected<br />
**Skig:** But I agree, Lt Cmdr, until we can be certain that somehow this is not replicating to everyone who has used the transporter, we should not use them until we can run a full diagnostic.<br />
**Skig:** Yes, the shuttles run a separate transporter grid.<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Oakadan): Oh no, is the Lister pregnant as well? </font><br />
*Skig pulls up a list of everyone who has gone through the transporter since Murry's "accident".*<br />
**Zox:** No time to waste! A standard bio-reactor should be close enough for those eggs.<br />
**Skig:** Hmm... we should check to see if Rhuk is pregnant with these eggs also.<br />
**Zox:** Skig, would you lend me a hand on this real quick?<br />
**Skig:** Oh sure.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pulls out her tricorder*<br />
*Skig looks at replicator.*<br />
**Skig:** "A hand for Zox, extra long, no claws."<br />
**Rhuk:** Why are you looking at me like that?<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti scans Rhuk*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No need to worry, just being extra cautious.<br />
**Skig:** Just making sure things don't get really awkward here, esteemed visitor.<br />

**Skig:** That is unusual.<br />
**Oakadan:** Does he want to speak with Skig or should we just check out the comms system? <br />
*Skig taps her comms badge.*<br />
>Zox punches in the plans for a suitable incubator in the transporter room replicator. As he hits the button an egg materializes on the replicator pad<br />

*Skig blinks.*<br />
**Lt. Malat:** We've been getting unusual power fluctuations up on the bridge<br />
**Oakadan:** Oh no<br />
**Skig:** Umm....<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Did you... make an egg?<br />
**Zox:** No. Not at all actually.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Not that it's my place to criticize sir, but... seems pretty reckless<br />
**Skig:** The ship just got.... herpes.<br />
**Zox:** is it more like Eggzema?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps the contamination is worse than we thought<br />
**Skig:** Yes, yes it is.<br />
**Skig:** "Steak dinner for one, please."<br />
**Skig:** Viraseti, can that to see if the replicator has the same instance of biocontaminant.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): "scan" not "can"</font><br />
**Zox:** Well, I think we are going to have to use a shuttle to beam everyone through a custom biofilter and remove eggs from 90% of the crew.<br />
**Oakadan:** We may want to do a scan of the crew to see if it's spread. I don't think anybody's actually used the transporters, but they've definitely used the incubaters.<br />
>The replicator whirs to life and produces another egg, this one superimposed over the first . As the replicator struggles to materialize two objects in the same space, it starts to make a groaning sound and the eegs both explode, showering the transporter room in a pale yellow goop<br />

**Skig:** If it is in the replication system, then anyone who has eaten in the past couple weeks is infected.<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti looks up from her tricorder just in time to dive behind a console*<br />
*Lt. Malat rolls out the door into the hall to avoid the goop*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well, that was exciting Commander<br />
**Oakadan:** Well, at least we don't need an incubator for those eggs<br />
**Zox:** I got this. No need to panic.<br />
*Zox orders another steak.*<br />
*Oakadan backs out of the room and drags Skig with him*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But not entirely fruitless, your hunch seems to have been correct Commander. I detected a power surge from the bioneural gel pack when the egg was materialized<br />
*Lt. Malat Another egg materializes on the pad*<br />

**Lt. Malat:** Sir, might I suggest that we do not need any MORE of those?<br />
**Zox:** Argh! My tricorder has eggs apparently; can someone scan this egg to prepare a biofilter algorithm discriminator?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I can have a look<br />
**Oakadan:** Here, some goggles for you<br />
*Oakadan gives the Lt Cmdr some goggles*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The eggs have a similar biosignature to the ones we detected in yourself and Counselor Murry, I think this plan of yours might work<br />
**Zox:** If you have captured it, I'd suggest bringin the tricorder to a shuttle and work from there.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Assuming that the shuttle systems haven't been infected<br />
**Zox:** There's no computer on board..correct!<br />
*Oakadan pulls out his own tricorder and checks out the goop to see if it's dangerous or appears otherwise infectious*<br />
**Skig:** Even if they have, we can isolate and purge from the shuttle without having to disable major ship's systems.<br />

>Skig, Zox and Viraseti to go the nearest turbolift and head for the bridge<br />

>As the turbolift whisks along towards the bridge, it suddenly shudders to a stop and the lights cut out<br />

>Moments later, the emergency lighting kicks in and bathes the turbolift in a dim blue light<br />

**Skig:** Whew, at least it has not switched to "spooky red light mode"<br />
**Zox:** Anyway out of here that doesn't involve crawling through maintenance tubes?<br />
*Skig pulls the access panel off the side and looks for access to the maintenance tubes.*<br />
**Zox:** I guess that answers that.<br />
**Skig:** Quite curious.<br />
**Skig:** We shall need to go up to reach the access point.<br />
**Skig:** Unless you want to try and pry the doors open and hope whatever is causing this doesn't activate the emergency release and plummet us to whatever it thinks the next lower level is.<br />
**Zox:** I think we need to be to the bridge asap and not risk more.<br />
**Zox:** Up we go<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** 14 decks is a long way to climb<br />
**Skig:** It is better than 30.<br />
*Skig climbs up the 14 decks to reach the bridge.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The bright side to serving on a Constituion and not a Sovereign?<br />
**Zox:** Some of us never left the trees, human.<br />

**Captain Baras:** I hope so, I could use some good news<br />
**Zox:** Hello!<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d6 = 5]**<br />
**Skig:** The bad news is, a shipwide manifestation of a corrupted biolfilter has resulted in whatever is infecting Zox and Murry to have also infected all of the shipwide systems and corrupted a massive number of systems, basically everything that is dependent on replicator and transporter technology. As a result, various ship systems are failing and a large number of crew members might be infected with eggs.<br />

**Captain Baras:** We need comms and power back, any suggestions?<br />
**Zox:** Yes. Skig knows how to provided we can get to the shuttle bay.<br />
**Skig:** Captain, the added health benefits of having to climb up and down all the turbolifts and eating organically grown food should not be underestimated.<br />
*Hailey Murry backs away from the door and looks around for a weapon*<br />
>As Murry and Rhuk look on towards the holodeck, the snout begins to come further out from the door, and they can see it is attached to a strange bipedal reptile. Not entirely Voth, nor entirely snake. But with legs below it and a very long neck<br />

*Rhuk begins to lick Hailey Murry's finger. clearly she is trying to communitcate that tasty food is to be found down the corridor.*<br />
**Skig:** But yes, we have an idea of how to purge the system, we are going to validate it by going all the way to the opposite side of the ship in a very manual and time taking process. Then we are going to test this out.<br />
**Skig:** However, in the meantime, I highly recommend not using the replicators.<br />
*Zox Nods enthusiastically.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, very much so<br />
*Zox Skig has told me the details of the plan and it is sound tactically.*<br />

**Captain Baras:** Understood, wherever you need to go to get main power restored, get on it<br />
**Skig:** Right away Captain. I apologize that the Lister is misbehaving in this way, we will need to figure out how to update our biofilters to prevent this in the future.<br />
