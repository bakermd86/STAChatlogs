>INTERIOR - USS Lister, Main Engineering: T'Kor falls backwards away from the injector access panel, smoking (more than usual) from the many thousands of volts that just passed through his surprisingly conductive body.

 One falls to the deck near the door, and the other falls behind the control console.<br />

**Jasanis:** Disgusting<br />
*Jasanis winces in pain as she lifts herself up onto the main console to sit on the edge of it, keeping her disruptor aimed directly at Kolea the whole time*<br />
**Jasanis:** I have to give you credit, tricking my idiot crew to beam you up to my ship was unexpected<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I get the feeling that most of today has been unexpected for you<br />
**Jasanis:** But you should be a little more cautious about using other people's transporters, do you know how easy it is to materialize foreign bodies during materialization?<br />
**Kolea:** Yes<br />
**Jasanis:** Oh you have no idea girlscout<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Very<br />
**Jasanis:** For instance: a small neuro-chemical disruptor materialized in the brain stem can easily be activated to block all motor signals to the body<br />
**Kolea:** I'm sure you are directing that Disruptor Rifle at me since you would likely have that set to not work on Orion women.<br />
**Jasanis:** Perceptive<br />
**Jasanis:** I will disintigrate you if you make me sister<br />
**Kolea:** Assuming, of course, that the Bynars had not changed that so it works on both of us as well.<br />
**Jasanis:** Now, today has been a... very long day... And I want to kill you all slowly for all the headaches you have caused me....<br />
**Jasanis:** Sadly... my buyers on this deal have a weird aversion to me killing Federation citizens. And if they beam in here and notice the disintigrated remains of four Starfleet officers, then I will be properly fucked. So today is your lucky day.<br />
**Kolea:** Well, Orion Sister, as one member of our species to another, I can tell you are bleeding out a lot more than you would like to admit.<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, credit to our species that you are upright.<br />
**Jasanis:** I've had worse<br />
**Kolea:** So have I, no reason to suffer though.<br />
**Jasanis:** If you are trying to talk me into letting you give me some injection from your little bag, you can give up on that. I trust you about as far as I can throw him<br />
*Jasanis gestures to Zox*<br />
**Kolea:** Nope, you would be an idiot to take medical treatment from me. I'm just making an observation.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did your crew know you were installing these little devices into them this entire time?<br />
**Jasanis:** My crew are a bunch of the dumbest hired guns you've ever seen<br />

**Jasanis:** I use Nausicaans for grunt work, and Pakleds for my bridge crew<br />
**Jasanis:** I don't want anyone around smart enough to try to depose me<br />
**Jasanis:** Now the question remains of what to do with a bunch of medling Starfleet officers<br />
**Jasanis:** I can't risk T'Pau or his asshole boyfriend finding out that I killed you a few hours before closing my deal<br />
**Jasanis:** You have no idea how hard it was to get this far... <br />
**Jasanis:** Paletor bought me at a slave market when I was 11 years old. I have spent the last 25 years of my life plotting, and stealing, and killing, and doing... things I do not want to rehash here.... And after all of that, I am this close to buying out my contract, paying off my franchise fees, and getting the fuck out.<br />
**Kolea:** If you would care to enlighten us, that would be great.<br />
**Kolea:** Kudos, I'm much farther from paying off my contract than that.<br />
**Kolea:** If you don't mind though...<br />
**Jasanis:** My life would have been a lot easier if you had just stayed on the planet and died there<br />
**Kolea:** Given how badly some of the people here are, I'm sure you wouldn't mind if I just kept them alive so you don't get in trouble.<br />
*Kolea slowly pulls out her medical tricoder, keeping her eyes on Jasanis.*<br />
**Jasanis:** Fine, you can give some medical care to your little computer friends<br />
**Kolea:** Thank you, sister.<br />
**Jasanis:** And then you are all going into my brig until after I have closed this deal<br />
**Jasanis:** I am not letting you fuck this up, alive or dead<br />
*Kolea carefully walks over to the Bynars.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Huh. Where did you actually get the matrix from? <br />
**Jasanis:** I cut it out of your XO<br />
**Jasanis:** Why do you think I captured her in the first place? To have a heart-to-heart?<br />
**Jasanis:** For her shining company?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I figured you two had history. She contacted you first, then? <br />
**Jasanis:** No you idiot, someone on your ship sold her out<br />
*Hailey Murry rolls her eyes*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And that would be this "Janus"?<br />
**Jasanis:** Yeah, I was working with a broker to try to put a deal together that would make us both a ton of latinum<br />
**Jasanis:** A buyer in the DMZ wants a bunch of exotic particle weapon cells, but the only seller who can provide them isn't interested in money<br />
**Jasanis:** Turns out, the only thing they are willing to trade for is the white, and I'm the only person in the Alpha Quandrant with a chemical refinery and knowledge of how to refine the stuff<br />
**Jasanis:** Trouble is the reaction has to be stabilized in a bath of changeling morphogenic matrix, so I tell the buyer he's out of luck, the stuff is literally impossible to get<br />
**Jasanis:** Until, conveniently, I get a message from someone calling themselves "Janus" who tells me where I can find a hiding changeling, and as if that wasn't convenient enough it's going to be on a planet where the Federation is also, "coincidentally" researching how to synthesize the chemical components of Ketracel White<br />
**Jasanis:** So you tell me girlscout: What do you think the odds are that my buyer is in Starfleet?<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Meaning the buyer of the particle weapon cells, not the buyer of the white itself</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Were you planning on cutting Janus out of the deal and taking all the money, or getting that money to them? <br />
*Zox looks uncomfortable.*<br />
**Jasanis:** Janus didn't want any money, didn't ask for anything, just started feeding me intel<br />
**Jasanis:** I assume he or she works for my buyers<br />
**Jasanis:** And they are trying to make sure that they get those particle cells<br />
*Hailey Murry glances at Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I really have a feeling that Jasanis needs to find some backwater planet and change her identity real quick<br />
>The conversation is interuppted by the comms crackling to life <br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Waaaaay too many people don't like loose ends.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We should plan accordingly.<br />
**Comms voice:** Bridge to Jasanis, we are entering orbit of Porea Synet IV. T'Pau is requesting permission to beam up<br />
**Jasanis:** Permission granted<br />
>Moments later, a man wearing a Vulcan style robe materializes on the transporter pad and looks around the room, surveying the situation<br />

**T'Pau:** Curious<br />
**T'Pau:** I can only logically conclude that your efforts to investigate Jasanis' illegal activities have come to a head at a rather unfortunate time<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We've found it rather convenient, actually<br />
**T'Pau:** Hmm<br />
**T'Pau:** Well you seem to have all of the leverage here<br />
*T'Pau pulls back his hood to reveal his face*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): !</font><br />
**T'Pau:** Logically, the only thing we can do is appeal to your humanity. If you confiscate the Ketracel white, we will die<br />
