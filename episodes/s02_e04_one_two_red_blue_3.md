>INTERIOR - Deck 7: Murry steps out from the Jeffries tube to find the floor strewn with mutilated corpses, blood is smeared all over the walls, the ship on this deck appears to be operating on emergency power only. As Murry investigates the bodies on the floor, the crew hears a distant howl echo through the deck. The faint pitter patter of paws and claws on the carpeted deck plating rises from the silence, then grows louder, and louder.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Wait, CARPETED deck plating?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** What unholiness is this?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Probably the worst kind<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm pretty sure I had a contingency plan for situations like this in the Lister where I would activate robotic cleaning devices call RoomBots to keep the area clean.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Back inside, quickly<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I wonder if... nah... I doubt they would somehow develop sentience and turn into raging crew slaughtering robotic machines who dirty up the Lister.<br />
>The crew quickly return to the Jeffries tube and descend to Deck 8. When Skig pops the hatch open, she is assaulted by the sudden wave of heat as she peeks out to see the entire deck is flooded with hot electro plasma<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Maybe we should rig a vent redirection to pump this on to Deck 7?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So....A missing bridge vaporized by an accident or hostile weapons....or some sort of horrible monster?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Maybe the Tholians took over and T'Kor is running around?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Chief Skig, how about we see if we can vent hot plasma through a conduit array to dump into Deck 7 from here?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** Rigging an EPS pump is easy enough, but I don't have one on me.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** Any ideas for how to pump hundreds of liters of hot electro plasma?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** While I dislike floor 7 more than this one, it's hard to argue that this floor is more navigable <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Sure, we just generate a quantum chronodynamics mesh using the interaction of boson relays to create a mobile wand like substance that will effectively force the heat to generate an internal suction by following the Lepton curvature of the cross quark equilibrium constant.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Do you have a bobby pin?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** That's all well and good, but if you make one mistake calculating the intermolecular flux it's going to spray hot, energized plasma at high pressure all over you.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, you only live a few hundred times.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** We're also going to need a hole to pump it through<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Worse case scenario, my calculations are wrong and it causes the plasma relay to decide to fuse through Murry's head because her DNA is on the bobby pin.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** But that's okay, right Murry?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** This sounds reckless, dangerous and ill advised<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm pretty sure that's not how quantum mechanics works, but I appreciate offering me the feedback<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I would just shoot a hole in the deck with a phaser<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, to be fair, I was also planning on using a transwarp inductor from that panel over there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** But Malat's approach is acceptable also.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** As a collector of exotic injuries, I think this plan is wonderful.<br />
>Skig and Zox rig up a makeshift pump and use spare parts from the jeffries tube to quantum tunnel the plasma through the deck. Miraculously, this somehow works without incinerating the crew, and the plasma covering the deck slowly receds until the deck plating is once again visible. Whisps of smoke rise from the still hot deck plates, and the acrid smell of singed metal and polymers fills the air<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I am relatively certain no bingo card among the medical staff has, "Transwarp Quantum induced EPS immolation" as a box.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Let's move quickly<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I agree.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Skigs, let us be on our way.<br />
*Skig heads into deck 8 to make the way over to the forward section of deck 11 to check the navigational computer core.*<br />
>While Skig and Zox rig up their dangerous contraption, the team decide it is better to head to Deck 11 first to get their bearings.<br />

>They open the hatch on Deck 11 and peer out, seeing a calm, quiet area with no signs of crew activity. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm... that could just mean they are all dead.<br />

*Zox tries to figure out what the gimmick here is, but...well them's the dice.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I wonder what the Complete Crew Casualty Rate among all Listers across all multiverses is?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** My estimate is approximatly 60%<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Based on readings I have been taking thus far<br />

*Skig scans for dangerous chemicals, unusual chemicals, weird system anomalies or lifesigns with her tricoder from the Jefferies tube.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** How is it both?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Interesting; should we administer immunosuppressants, and then just have some yogurt later?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Yes, but bacteriophages are a type of virus, not a type of bacteria. Bacteriophages infect bacteria<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It's going after our gut biome, very fast<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Also it looks like the anomaly moved to surround the Lister, not the other way around<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Given the rate of replication I estimate you would need to consume 140kg of yogurt per day to conteract the effect<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** That may have other effects on your health<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That's good, because it would be weird if the Lister somehow surrounded the anomaly.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** With that much yogurt, it might be easier to just get it injected directly into my system.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Maybe just setup a transporter to beam 15kg an hour into my stomach.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Perhaps yogurt consumption is not the best solution<br />

>INTERIOR - Deck 11: Skig and Chief Skig are doubled over in pain as the autoimmune reaction to the viral phage painfully ravages their intestines. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** So, last week after the fliming ended, I stopped at the supermarket for a yogurt parfait and I think I better understand what a viral bacteriophage would be like. Therefore.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** It's probably attaching to the mostly yeast-based bacteria that are unique to Tellerites and explains our high resistance to pain and alcohol. Those tend to have strong markers of infection due to our micro-biome.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Right, which is easy to detect when they get completely out of control.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** If it weren't for that, you could have unknowningly tracking this phage around until you died of malnourishment<br />
*Skig is tempted to chug a bottle of Tellerite 160 proof "tax payment day wine" to help her bacteria out.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** So what is your recommended treatment?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** I will need to do some tests in order to work out a treatment protocol. One of you will need to remain here as a test subject<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** Preferably the big lizard, I'd like to get a look at his Renal system while he's here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** What could possibly be exiciting about my renal system?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** He's an interesting specimen in a lot of regards<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How long do you think it'll take? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** MedSkig, I'm going to remind you that vivisection is illegal according to Starfleet regulations.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** I'll put it back<br />
*Skig looks at MedSkig with, "I know what you are thinking".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** As for how long it will take... hard to say, perhaps a few hours, perhaps a few days<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm not sure if we have a few days, and I don't like the idea of tracking this plague around<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Possible we may not bring it back to our node of reality.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** Well I could whip up an injection of Tellerite antibodies<br />
*Skig is a little disturbed that MedSkig has not immediately locked the entire area down in a quarantine field. Clearly MedSkig IS sheltered and not nearly paranoid enough. Or she is hiding it really well.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_skig.png" alt="Dr. Skig" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Skig** It would give you autoimmune symptoms similar to your Skig, but would prevent you from transmitting the phage<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm not sure I would recommend that as a course of action.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** These are not pleasant autoimmune symptoms.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Neither's accidentally wasting away, though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** And we can suppress it with that batch that Zox constructed<br />
