>INTERIOR - Briefing room: As the senior staff debate their options of how to address the Xepai ultimatum, Dr. Zerra and Commander Viraseti are becoming increasingly energized with arguing for their positions. On the monitors, Viraseti watches as the Venonans carving likenesses of Dr. Zerra as one of their gods.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** This why the Prime Directive exists in the first place. Your good intentions have irrevocably altered the development of an entire culture.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Xenoarheologists of the future an learn about how the devotees of Zerra launhed a holy war to eradiate the non-believers.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is there a prime directive for software development?<br />
**Ishemok:** Any chance we can just offer them another planet?<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): What does the prime directive say about letting *other* aliens conduct experiments on primative cultures?</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We cannot make decisions based on the hypothetical harms to potential future people! There are real, living people in that village who were dying a slow and paingful death<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I can't predict the future, but without treatment I know that those people would have died painfully over months.<br />
**Ishemok:** So you are saying, we can't let these poor, downtrodden people be squashed by insects?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am saying that we can't possibly predict the long term consequences of our actions on the development of an entire culture.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Recklessly inserting ourselves into the natural course of their pre-warp evolution could have impacts on the future lives of billions of Venonans<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I may be a cold-blooded monster, but we should free the planet from the grip of the Xepai. If the Voth hadn't left Earth, there'd be no Federation and no Prime Directive.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** "Could have", "Future lives" <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Give life a chance.<br />
**Throk:** Throk agree with Viraseti, after all, who expected invention of Twitter to cause 2 centuries of mental retardation in humans?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's equally possible that Dr Zerra's mercy will serve as a role model for them for ages to come and serve as a foundation of mercy and understanding that will lead their people to be enlightened even beyond the Federation's ken. But really, we should not deal with the hypotheticals, we have a real situation to focus on. <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** What's done is done, if you want to report me for it later you can<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But we need to figure out a way to stop the Xepai from exterminating these people<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Philosophical matters aside, we have the small issue of the Xepai plotting to exterminate them all and determining the best course of action.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think that the Xepai would have demanded the town's elimination regardless of how much contact Dr Zerra would have had. The ship was sighted by the town on its descent<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, as Zerra said.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We can't necessarily assume that Counselor. We don't really know what motivates the Xepai<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What level of contamination makes them willing to wipe out the village? What are they even doing here?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That's true. I was thinking that the contamination was in contact with an advanced civilization, but it may have been the medical contact or treatment. What information do we have on the Collective? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Psst. They want minerals and energy. I'm not certain they are as different as you think.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, their motivation might have been, "What impact on a sentient species does exposing them to a faulty Romulan style warp-singularity have on their physical and mental well-being?"<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Very little, this is strictly speaking a first contact situation.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, we are dealing with two first contact situations. One the Prime Directive is very clear on, the other, as a sparefaring society, it is established we should do our best to come to an amicable solution to open the door to Starfleet's Diplomatic Corps in a positive way.<br />
*Skig is worried she has committed some major faux pas and has killed all conversation.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though one does have to wonder how the Federation would feel about the experimentation they're doing as well. We need more information<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Fortunately, we have uploaded all the data and linguistic analysis from their station to the Lister for analysis, it should offer some insights once it is done compiling.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You know Counselor, if this were a normal first contact situation, standard protocol would be to suggest a cultural exchange<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Might be a good excuse to probe for some human intelligence<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or... Xepai intelligence in this case<br />
**Throk:** Throk offer to tear head off their second in command and determine if brain can be used as salad topping.<br />
*Throk drops off some more cookies and leaves.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We must be out of Bacon Bits...better restock those before Throk wants better toppings...<br />
*Hailey Murry makes notes for Throk's next evaluation*<br />
*Skig changes access code on briefing room door so Throk can't get back in, also, makes note to check recipe for cookies, as these have too much sugar in them.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Are you two keeping a close eye on him?<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SCIENCE  (4)]
[Focus: Shipboard Tactical Systems ]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 26]**<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I don't want to read a report about the junior officers he eats some day<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I assigned crewmen to keep an eye on him discreetly, emphasis on doing so in pairs<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** He won't do anything bad. <br />
*Skig makes a note to remind Zox to stop using "Unidentified Transporter Error" for missing crewmen reports.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Mostly to make sure he doesn't accidentally poison the staff again with his cooking<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, I thought it was normal to have slight indigestion after Gorn cooking.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But I feel like Throk's progressed a lot in his sessions. He's unlikely to use any allies for ingredients, which was not certain when he was first assigned to us<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Anyway, we need to address the problem at hand, not deal with the usual slew of quirks of this crew and our horribly idiosyncratic behavior.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Before Bachar's left eyebrow stops twitching like it currently is.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, can someone wake up the Captain?<br />
*Skig gestures to nudge Baras.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It is the idiosyncratic behavior of one of our crew that got us into this situation<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Venonan </font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True, but that was not Throk this week.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Captain Baras. I have located an M-class planet of similar composition and mineral content at location QWERTY-1234. Perhaps we could negotiate for a slight redrawing of this netural zone and offer the Xepai our planet for this one, hence, placing the Venonan within the protective custody of the Federation.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Viraseti and Zerra can settle their debate, but we should get the Xepai out of the situation.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Abducting people from their homeworld and depositng them on a new planet "for their own good" is no better than the colonialism of ancient Earth<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We aren't re-locating anyone =D<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hold on, Viraseti, would you actually rather we kill them all? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** There is also the problem of the carrying capacity of the Lister. There are at least several thousand Venonans in the village, to transport them all aboard the Lister would require dozens of round trip journeys<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We should be focusing on convincing the Xepai not to purge the village and limit any further contact with the Venonans<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** If the Xepai cannot be convinced, then we should have a backup plan<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** At least Zox has a plan to avoid massive bloodshed, we just need to work out the details<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** To that end, I think I'm going to go gather up some details so we can begin our first contact and offer an exchange of cultures. That might help clue us in on what their mores and folkways are<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It might also buy us some time.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Agreed. In the meantime, Zox take the lead on working out your rellocation plan. If Murry can't work something out with them, we should have a backup option ready<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): OH NO</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, I don't want to see them relocated at all. I want them to keep this planet and the Xepai to find another M-Class they can live on and exploit to their hearts content.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Captain, I have to strongly object to Zox's plan<br />
*Skig does not recommend sending over Zox and Throk in the initial boarding party to demonstrate our willingness to work with other cultures, as a postscript adds Murry to that list also.*<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): It's okay, Baras was asleep</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, I think you have misinterpreted Zox's thick Voth accent.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, he clearly wants to trade the Xepai some other planet and not rellocate the Venonans. What the hell did you think he said?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** He meant that we would offer to exchange QWERTY-1234 with the Xepai and keep this world, effectively redrawing the boarders between our two species.<br />
*Skig looks at Malat.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Correct! Thank you commander.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I withdraw my objection then, my mistake<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's okay Bart, people make mistakes all the time.<br />
*Skig looks at communicator.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wish every living sentient thing the chance to flourish, every planet is but a small nest that must be guarded and nurtured!<br />

**Ishemok:** If they can manage that many legs, they'd be amazing traders. Watch out.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Our records don't appear to be up-to-date, so we definitely want to get those updated to ensure we don't repeat this situation at a later date. Similarly, I'd like to ensure that we can adequately resolve the unintentional interference with the study. We may be able to offer some unique insights if we knew a little more about it. <br />
*Ishemok reviews his notes on trying to sell time-share property.*<br />
**Satag:** We will provide you with a record of our borders. But we do not know what study you speak of. We are conducting to scientific inquiries<br />
*Throk offers Zox some buttered popcorn, which gets splattered all over the consoles and makes a horrible mess.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: no* scientific inquiries</font><br />
*Skig gets annoyed at how much of a mess Zox and Throk make on HER precious ship consoles when they eat at work.*<br />
*Lt. Malat loudly eats popcorn while watching Murry's first contact attempts on the monitors*<br />
**Kolea:** I believe you referenced a colonization plan in our earlier communication, how does that relate to your scientific studies? I'm curious what the interplay between the two would be.<br />
**Satag:** We are conducting no studies. Our purpose here is to prepare this world for future inclusion in the Xepai collective<br />

>Satag spends some time updating the Starfleet records with Murry to reflect their borders. Murry is able to build something of a raport with the surly bug-man as they discuss it. The borders he lays out extend to several adjacent star systems beyond this one, but are relatively small compared to larger regional powers.<br />

**Satag:** I hope now your Federation will respect our borders in the future Counselor<br />
**Kolea:** A firm understanding of borders is a key ingredient to mutual respect of those borders, thank you for taking the time to assist us with this.<br />
*Kolea nudges Murry to suggest swapping some planets around.*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): camera man #5 dies after hearing swap?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): No, "firm"</font><br />
**Satag:** Unlike your Federaion, we are not expansionist. We remain in the confines of our space and do not blindly violate others'.<br />
*Throk shows Zox his latest issue of, "Gorn Cookiing" which features recipes with 1.7m tall insects and different uses of butter and herbs.*<br />
**Kolea:** I can empathize as I despise being blindfolded while being violated.<br />
*Satag squints at Kolea*<br />
**Satag:** That seems to be obviously implied by the meaning of those words, unless my translator is malfunctioning<br />
*Throk wonders how warm it is under that costume for the actor inside it, who will be unknown until the end credits.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** First impressions are important. With that said, we would like to inquire about a trade in planets. There are a few planets that we've done some analysis on already. Would any of these be of interest to your people? <br />
**Satag:** We have no interest in expanding our borders<br />
*Throk rotates screen 90 degrees to get a better idea of how to put Satag on a spit.*<br />
*Throk nudges Zox.*<br />
**Satag:** Our last border expansion was 60 or your years ago, and our population forecasts project another 200 of your years before we require another world to colonize<br />
**Throk:** I think Pad Satag would be a good option for me to submit to Gorn Cooking.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Venonan</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Speaking of which, your colonization here. I can't help but notice that it's the Venonan down on the planet instead of the Xepai. <br />
*Geret begins to think that time flies when talking to insects.*<br />
**Satag:** Yes, they are native to this planet. It will be many centuries before they are prepared to integrate into the Collective<br />
**Kolea:** By joining the Collective, you would, as they become capable of space flight, add them to your species' governmental structure as a member species?<br />
**Satag:** Yes. But they must be carefully prepared to avoid damaging our consensus<br />
*Zox begins to think of aphids farmed by ants.*<br />
**Kolea:** The Federation works along similar ideas, albeit in a more raucous and disruptive fashion at times.<br />
**Satag:** Your Federation is rife with disagreement and disunity<br />
**Kolea:** Exactly.<br />
**Satag:** We do not simply incorporate alien cultures into our consensus<br />
**Satag:** They must be shaped and guided to ensure that they will function smoothly in our society<br />
**Satag:** Your interference has jeapordized that<br />
**Kolea:** Those disagreements can lead to strength at times and maintain stronger racial identities for the member species, but there is a risk of disunity from it, as you have observed.<br />
**Satag:** Your doctor answered their prayers without them taking action<br />
**Satag:** Such cultural lessons encourage weakness<br />
**Satag:** Weakness is not tollerated in the collective<br />
*Ishemok hangs his pixels in shame, so quick to judge a horrible bug monster.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I see, what sort of action were you awaiting? <br />
**Satag:** If they are allowed to spread this message, it could poison their entire culture<br />
**Kolea:** Question though, I can't help but notice that outside the building with the failed singularity, a statue in the likeness of your species. Is the intent to spread a cultural message to them of worship of a spacefaring insectoid species?<br />
**Geret:** But aren't things like Radiation impossible for them to grok? It isn't fair to offer them the prospect at technological and moral progress without a smooth incline of difficulty?<br />
**Satag:** We have elected to use their pre-existing religious beliefs as a tool to guide their development<br />
*Satag turns to Geret*<br />
**Satag:** The radiation exposure was unintentional, but before we could repair it the inhabitants had already discovered the symptoms<br />
*Kolea checks notes.*<br />
**Satag:** Many villages had radiation sickness<br />
**Satag:** However, in most the inhabitants began experimenting, looking for solutions on their own<br />
**Geret:** I can empathize with everything you have said so far, except testing them with a challenge they couldn't hope to overcome naturally, as it is not of their world.<br />
**Kolea:** And they had tried, to the best of their ability, to offer up placation and supplication for this particular village.<br />
**Satag:** And we stepped in only when they could plausibly believe that such a solution had worked<br />
**Satag:** This village has been praying for salvation for decades<br />
**Satag:** And has done nothing at all to save themselves<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ah, I see. And this village had been focusing on placation rather than actually acting to fix the situation? <br />
**Satag:** You have now shown them that blind devotion to an uncaring god is the solution to their problems<br />
**Satag:** And they will spread that message<br />
**Satag:** We would rather that they die as a lesson to the other inhabitants that their gods will not save them if they cannot lift a finger to save themselves<br />
**Geret:** Primark Satag. Could you not impersonate a Venonan, and show the process of science to them? Can you give them hints to reveal the potential that is there? This test may be exceedingly harsh.<br />
*Satag pulls out the cultural database Murry sent him*<br />
*Kolea (mutters) I really can't argue his point when I kind of agree with it.*<br />
**Satag:** There is a saying in your own culture: "Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, and he will eat for life"<br />
**Geret:** I can see the utility and your logic, but being exposed to a problem beyond their progress just seems out of scope, an impossible feat.<br />
**Satag:** And yet, the other villages when faced with the same problem did everything in their power to save themselves<br />
*Kolea passes sticky note to Geret, "But evidently other villages figured out how to handle it or moved out of the area."*<br />
**Geret:** Oh? Do tell. <br />
**Geret:** Interesting!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Were the malfunctions intentional, then? <br />
**Satag:** No, but the locals had noticed the symptoms before we discovered them<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The locals of one village, but what of the others? <br />
**Geret:** Hrm, have you considered what us humans call 'carrots' vs 'sticks' to coerce behavior? You have mastered the stick, but what about the carrot?<br />
**Satag:** This has been enlightening Counselor, but our problem remains<br />
**Satag:** We cannot allow this village to contaminate the broader Venonan culture. If you cannot find some way to repair the damage of this cultural lesson of undeserved benevolence, then we will be force to eliminate it in our own way<br />
**Satag:** You have... <br />
*Satag checks his chronometer*<br />
**Satag:** 18 of your hours remaning<br />
*Satag gets up and skitters back to the transporter room*<br />
*Throk offers to fix Satag's sundial.*<br />
