>INTERIOR - Aldazed Brig: The away team wake up behind a forcefield in an Aldazed Cartel brig. Two large orion males guard the door with disruptor rifles. The angry crackle and hiss of the forcefield give you the distinct impression<br />

**Throk:** Throk feels there is a great disturbance in the space-time continuum, as if millions of possible opportunities just died gruesomely and were forever silenced.<br />
>INTERIOR - Aldazed Brig: The away team wake up behind a forcefield in an Aldazed Cartel brig. Two large orion males guard the door with disruptor rifles. The angry crackle and hiss of the forcefield give you the distinct impression that the orions do not build the same safety protocols into their forcefields, and it would be very bad to touch.<br />

**Ishemok: [ DARING  (10) +  CONN  (4)]

Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 22]**<br />
**T'Kor:** This force field appears to be violating about half as many safety protocols as the environment field conductor did in Old Faithless for a while. I do not recommend touching it. <br />
**Throk:** Throk once lick blinking field like this with tongue. Throk talk oddly for weeks.<br />
**T'Kor:** Did you used to have two tongues?<br />
**Throk:** Throk not remember, much of world fuzzy before that point.<br />
*Hailey Murry takes notes for therapy later*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What does phased plasma taste like? Blue moon ice cream or cotton candy?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You shouldn't want to find out<br />
**Throk:** Phased plasma taste much like strawberry shortcake.<br />
**Jasanis:** No go ahead, taste tests are included in your stay. No additional charge.<br />
*Jasanis comes around the corner carrying a duffel bag and a padd, looking smug*<br />
*Zox Gasps*<br />
**T'Kor:** Plasma is normally heavily charged<br />
**Throk:** Umm...green woman still have large piece of Pankar Plant between third and fourth upper bicuspid. Drastically reduces threatening demeanor.<br />
**Jasanis:** Oh I'm not here to threaten, just wanted to see for myself.<br />
**Throk:** Oh good, because your left knee pad is also undone, which makes me wonder what caused that to happen. You very non-threatening like this, so good to know threaten is not intention.<br />
**Jasanis:** I have to say I'm dissapointed girl scout, I thought you would be more of a problem. I didn't even know you were on board and then my people tell me you're captured? Dissapointing...<br />
**Jasanis:** Takes some of the fun out of it<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe you should hire guards other than Naussicans. It's not very sporty.<br />
*Hailey Murry mostly just glowers at her*<br />
**Jasanis:** Big tough Starfleet officer like you complaining about some hired thugs? <br />
**Jasanis:** You're supposed to be the big superpower now, you beat the Borg, you beat the Dominion, but my boys are too much for you?<br />
*Throk looks at the rest of the group, he's not an officer, so she must be talking to someone else.*<br />
*Jasanis laughs derisively*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, at least you are properly gloating now.<br />
*Throk gets out popcorn for monologue.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Do we get one call? Ya know, being stuck in jail?<br />
**Jasanis:** Oh sure, Orion civilization treats the rights of prisoners with great respect<br />
**Jasanis:** Your lawyer should be here soon, and then we'll have a counselor to assess how you feel about captivity and whether you can be rehabilitated<br />
*Zox blinks in repitle.*<br />
*Jasanis sits down and kicks her feet up, one of her guards brings her a drink*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Making yourself right at home over there, huh? <br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest not try lobotomy rehabilitation on Murry, that already has been tried and end result is more psychosis.<br />
**Jasanis:** Actually we have to leave, security protocol and all<br />
**Jasanis:** It's very annoying. You're costing us a lot of money<br />
**Jasanis:** But thankfully: my employer doesn't know you're here this time, and I don't see any Starfleet uniforms<br />
**Jasanis:** So I can just throw you out an airlock. What he doesn't know wont hurt him<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** You haven't so far, which makes me wonder if it's really just your inflated ego<br />
**T'Kor:** I actually would not mind the airlock<br />
**Throk:** Before Throk die, Throk have one question of green lady, but can save it for later.<br />
**Jasanis:** I will admit, I wanted to come rub it in your face a bit first<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Im pretty sure it's about 6 hours before Starfleet knows exactly where we are.<br />
**Jasanis:** This is the second time you have cost me a lot of money little girl<br />
**Jasanis:** I think I'm going to kill the others first, and make you watch...<br />
**Jasanis:** You two<br />
*Jasanis snaps her fingers*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not my fault you're careless with your money<br />
**Throk:** Throk understand many Orion men like "watching" but first he has heard of women being the same way.<br />
*Throk scratches head in confusion.*<br />
>The two Orion guards ready their disruptor rifles, but just then an alert klaxon goes off and Jasanis jumps back to her feet<br />

*Jasanis narrows her eyes at the away team*<br />
*Zox smiles in reptile.*<br />
*Throk narrows eyes at Jasanis.*<br />
**Jasanis:** Kill the lizards, leave the pink one for me<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Better hurry up, unless you want to lose more money<br />
*Jasanis storms out*<br />
**Throk:** Wait, you no escape without me asking question first!<br />
*Throk growls.*<br />
**T'Kor:** Well, it's been nice knowing you, Throk and Zox<br />

>INTERIOR - Malat's "new" trasport: T'Kor and Ishemok were preparing to beam out the away team, but when the photon grenade went off, the interference prevented them from obtaining a transporter lock. Before they could get another clean lock, the entire away team was locked away behind a forcefield.<br />

**Kosal Oram:** What are you doing? Beam them out.<br />
**Kosal Oram:** Hello! Computer man!<br />
**Ishemok:** I tried! I can't close this deal!<br />
**T'Kor:** They set off some sort of explosive device, it's released too much interfering radiation<br />
**Ishemok:** Either I don't understand strange Orion technology, or they are playing with military grade explosives.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Give it a rest, we're not beaming them out<br />
>T'Kor and Ishemok see Commander Bachar and Skig beam into the transport<br />

**Ishemok:** Dramatic Reveal!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We have a limited window of opportunity here before they execute them<br />
**T'Kor:** Oh, hello Skig! <br />
*Cmdr Bachar looks at T'Kor and narrows her eyes*<br />
*T'Kor waves and clicks in greeting to her as well*<br />
**Ishemok:** There's no way they'd execute them! Zox is a master of disguise, and would never get caught!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hello T'Kor, are you enjoying your trip out here?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Commander Skig, when we get back to the Lister we are going to have a long discussion about the reasons why you have a crewmember under your command who is listed as deceased<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You didn't take Old Faithless out for a spin, did you?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But right now we don't have time<br />
*Skig looks at Bachar.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar takes out an isolinear drive and slots it into the main computer*<br />
**T'Kor:** No, unfortunately the centrifugal forces are too great for her now, we need to reinforce the frame again or we'll lose the landing gear and keurig<br />
**Ishemok: [ INSIGHT  (9) +  SECURITY  (2)]
[Focus: Computers ]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 18]**<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** The Aldazed have strict operational security, now that their operation here has been blown they will evacuate, go to ground<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** The chaos is the perfect opportunity to slip in and gather whatever intel we can<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** His Tholian work permit was cancelled by the Starfleet work exchange program AND he wanted to stay in Starfleet, so we faked his death and took advantage of my apparent inability to do anything managerial properly meant he was able to not return back to a life he did not want to lead.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** But hey, let's let all the cats out of the bag.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Ishemok, get on the external drive. I'm going to get you into the station computer before they wipe everything<br />
**Ishemok:** I've already got the ship registrations of every vessel coming or going here for the past 6 hours. We have all the blackmail...I mean evidence we need. <br />
*Cmdr Bachar blinks at Skig*<br />
**Ishemok:** Sure! Sounds fun!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Skig, you and your dead friend need to figure out a way to get the crew out. Jasanis will want to gloat a bit before she kills them, come up with something before then<br />
**Ishemok:** does USB stand for Universal Syndicate Buster?<br />
**T'Kor:** I can't add the experience to my resume, but they say it's the friends you make along the way which counts<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, do you have the Empok Nor shielding array frequencies set? I assume you were planning on beaming them out even with the shields up.<br />
**T'Kor:** We've got the setup ready, though it might be easier to beam you into one of the unshielded portions. They have very poor coverage<br />

*Cmdr Bachar pulls the drive containing Ishemok*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Listen: You aren't the crew I would have picked for an operation like this, but you're Starfleet officers. I'm counting on you not to fuck this up.<br />
*T'Kor salutes!*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar dematerializes*<br />
**Kosal Oram:** Wow, I like her<br />
**Kosal Oram:** I bet she's good at Parrises Squares<br />
**T'Kor:** You should ask her to practice some with you later<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, I need you to lock on to our away team and transport them out.<br />

*Skig looks at Kosal.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** They set off some military grade explosives earlier, probably plasma related, it's still causing some interference. Let me see if I can get a clear read<br />
**T'Kor:** They set off some military grade explosives earlier, probably plasma related, it's still causing some interference. Let me see if I can get a clear read<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do you know how to repair a coffee maker?<br />
*T'Kor (delete first)*<br />
**Kosal Oram:** I know how to drink coffee<br />
**T'Kor:** Skig, it looks like they're currently behind a forcefield. We'll have to disable it to beam them out. Very inconsiderate of them<br />
**Kosal Oram:** What can I do to help?<br />
*Kosal Oram grabs a disruptor from the locker*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good enough, on your pad, place an order for 3000 shots of triple espresso with mocha frapppucino marshmallow toppings and book them to every account in this ledger, to be delivered to the Bajoran War Orphans fund.<br />
*Skig hands Kosal a list of accounts for the Aldazed Cartel.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And we might need the disruptor power supply later, but for now, just shoulder it.<br />
*Kosal Oram puts the disruptor away. *<br />
**Kosal Oram:** Sure...<br />
*Kosal Oram starts ordering coffee from the comms terminal*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, bring it up on Tactical.<br />
*Skig looks at the display.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, T'Kor, can you target the Nausicans outside the plasma field?<br />
*T'Kor is interrupted from putting some sort of metalic brace structure together, skittering back over to the main console to bring up the map*<br />
**T'Kor:** Yes, they're right here. It's worth noting that...hm, there's a third person in the room here. <br />
**T'Kor:** These two I think are the original guards, the other group near the door probably came in with this one<br />

**T'Kor:** Do you think we could take this Jasanis woman in a fight?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We don't have the ability to beam them all over, so as soon as Jasanis and her guards leave, we're going to beam over behind the remaining guards, disable them, turn off the forcefield and get everyone out.<br />
