>Captain's log, stardate 61221.7: Our mission to the Malari system to review their petition for Federation membership is nearing completion. The planet meets Federation standards for equality, liberty, good governance, and techonological sufficiency. The only out-standing report is the assessment of working conditions, which Commander Zox is spearheading.

Per his latest status report, his survey team has completed random inspections of several Malari facilities, but there is one other facility he selected to inspect: a dilitium mine. I worry that Zox is perhaps being overly susicious of the Malari, but I suppose that is to be expected. Regardless, once his inspection is complete we should be ready to break orbit and submit our recommendation to Starfleet Command regarding the Malari membership petition.<br />

*Hailey Murry Also, nothing says "I belong on a mining facility" like a demolitions focus*<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Also, nothing says "I belong on a mining facility" like a demolitions focus</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Mining Facility: The Malari mining crew chief Tumarara is showing Zox and the away team around the mining facility. The facility itself is very impressive, a number of tunnels converge on a large underground chamber where workers operate automated drones to procces the raw dilithium ore and package it for transport<br />

**Tumarara:** Are you satisfied yet Commander? As I explained on the surface, all of the dangerous tasks are handled by out unmanned drones. Now if you are done, we need to get back to work. We have a schedule to keep here.<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): characters were unbelievably competent last episdode, limiting the drama. Clearly we need to be more imperfect for good drama.</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I tend to distrust those who rush a good inspection.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Last week things went far too well, we had a ratings slump so we need more conflict and incompetence.</font><br />
**Tumarara:** I tend to distrust inspectors, they are usually more interested in their next promotion than the truth<br />
**Tumarara:** This facility has a spotless safety record<br />

**Lt. Malat:** I'm reading his life signs 200 meters this way Counselor<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Fantastic, let's head over that way. Are there any other life signs down here as well or is it just his?<br />
*Kolea follows dutifully along, scanning for life signs and particulate matter or dangerous effects.*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Oof. </font><br />
>The away team soon rounds a corner to find Commander Zox wrapped up by a large snake-like creature emerging from a hole in the shaft wall. Approximately 7 meters of snake are visible, but its tail is still inside the wall<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** And we should pretend this was a resounding success<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Got it, straight to sick bay or to a normal transporter room?<br />
*Zox is now convinved Kolea has a bigger crush on him than the SpaceSnek(TM)*<br />
**Lt. Malat:** I agree with the counselor. Snitches get stiches<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Sick bay, please, we should probably all get a look over<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I'm reporting this as a resounding success for testing out the transporters and the efficacy of the rebreathing equipment.<br />
*Crewman McAllister breathes a sign of relief that it was Kolea who got crushed by the rocks and not him, because he doubts Zox would have risked his life to save him*<br />
*Skig activates the transporter to send the entire Away Team to a medical bay with quarantine features to prevent spread of airborne contaminants.*<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Hmm....<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** So, I suppose we should probably double check if that was intentional venting of --where is Zox?<br />
*Dr. Zerra gets Kolea up onto a bed and... begins scanning her with his medical tricorder*<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** I'll set up a level 4 containment field<br />
*Dr. Zerra establishes a containment field around the diagnostic bay*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** We're ready here whenever you are commander<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Thank you Doctor, I shall begin the transport now.<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): oh no. SpaceSnek Fever.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Fen - Planning this episode, The only person susceptible to this DNA-altering SpaceSnek poison would be Zox, how can I possibly convince Tack that Zox needs to get constricted and poisoned by one of these?.... 5 minutes into the episode... nevermind.</font><br />
*Skig materializes Zox in the containment system.*<br />
*Dr. Zerra orders another nurse to take care of Kolea and turns his attention to Zox*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Interesting. There are no foreign organisms present, that must be why the transporter couldn't remove it. It looks like something is... rewriting the Commander's DNA<br />
**Kolea ***(thrashes in her sleep)*: Yes master, whip me more, I really like it when you do that.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** More herbivorous or carnivorous?<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): "Whip me herbivorously"</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Just need to know if I should reprogram the food synthesizers.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Hard to say Commander, I can give him an injection of a cellular inhibitor for now, it should slow down the genetic damage.<br />
*Dr. Zerra gives Zox two injections, and he starts to wake back up*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I'll have to do some further research to come up with a treatment plan<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** But this is very serious, if we don't find a way to reverse the genetic damage, there's no telling what could become of the commander<br />

**Captain Baras:** Dr, is he fit for duty?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I can't tell if he's feeling normal or if he's actually feeling different<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Impossible to say, normal for Zox is hard to pin down<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** As for his fitness for duty, if he is feeling up to it, I would not object. But I would insist that he wear a bio-monitor<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I need to be able to monitor his condition<br />

*Dr. Zerra pulls up a monitor and swivels it over so Zox can see, then sits down at his bedside*<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Well, see, your normal cells are the green ones, the blue ones are the infected cells, and the red ones are where the blinky thing next to the light relay system needed extra contrast.</font><br />
**Dr. Zerra:** This is your genetic fingerprint that we have on file from your last physical, and this is your DNA sequences now. As you can see, something in the venom from that creature began the process of rewriting your base pairs. <br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** While I know the technology has been banned since the Eugenics wars of Terra, can't you just over-write the re-wiriting since you have it all on file?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** We've filtered out the venom, but the process appears to be self-sustaining now<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** That is my hope, but our systems cannot sythesize viable Voth DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I have one hope for a treatment: a live donor<br />
*Skig is pretty certain whoever wrote Dr. Zerra's lines is the same person who wants to her claim that the global variable declarations for the warp containment system need capital letters to show importance.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** According to your personel file, your Mother lives on a colony less than 12 light years from here<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** With yours and the captain's permission, I'd like to take a detour there<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Mining Location A347.17 showed an excessive amount of dust on all their flame suppression units, indicating an absence of proper testing of the failover and suppression systems. Also, their women's restroom had an expired air freshener. However, I believe those are not exclusionary from Federation Membership.<br />

**Captain Baras:** Ummm.. Yes, I agree. I don't think we would be within protocol to reject their petition on those grounds<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I feel we should only approve if they are able to prove they take care of their workers' health; I feel as if they'd need better COBRA coverage.<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** I am not sure I fully understand what Zox is saying, but their medical database is very sparse. They don't have any record of treatments for this genetic damage that those snake-creatures cause<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** That's sort of a problem if they intend to continue to work down there.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** I don't see why we are even considering their petition, they are barely even warp capable<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** From what I can find in the records, it looks like that was about what was expected. No sign of any sabotage with the ventillation nor sending those worm-things at us. So I have no objections. <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** COBRA is only used during severance, and the snakes do not sever limbs, I think they need to show proper STGD coverage. Which is Short-Term Genetic Dismemberment, available from the Ferengi Bureau of Employee Transactional Coverage.<br />

**Captain Baras:** In that case, barring any last-minute objections or addendums to the reports, I will prepare my report to starfleet.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I agree with Malat, their propulsion and transwarp systems are very rudimentary. However, their proper handling of environmental systems and distant stellar location has likely curtailed development of more robust systems. Their computer and engineering standards are quite robust. Although I did manage to procure a number of these really awesome vaccum tubes from one of their scientists. I plan to add it to my music box.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Before we adjourn, Commander Zox, are there any cultural norms we should be aware of before welcoming your mother aboard?<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Actually mild to moderate excercise is generally recommended during the first 2 trimesters of human pregnancy<br />
**Rhuk:** Tell me Dr. Zerra?<br />
*Hailey Murry takes a seat on the patient bench*<br />
*Skig looks at Malat.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** It matches Zox for sure. But it also contains markers of the genetic signature of those snake creatures<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Well that's a twist.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I wonder if this is what the genetic damage was attempting to do<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** This could be their form of procreation, fascinating<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh nooooo<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Zox, you are the mother of an entire new species that is a hybrid of Voth and snake-creature that gestates inside humanity.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I...I am not sure the words to react that exist in either of our native languages Skig<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** But this suit is great work<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Thanks, I am glad it is working for you.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Dr. Zerra, if all you need is unfertilized eggs to repair Zox, that is an easy matter. <br />
**Rhuk:** Dr. Zerra, if all you need is unfertilized eggs to repair Zox, that is an easy matter. <br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, yes. Of course. I forgot about that<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Pardon?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I got a little distracted by the current situation<br />
*Dr. Zerra grabs a sample container and gives it to Rhuk*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** If you can give me a few eggs in here, I can use that to get started on the treatment for Zox<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Yes, simply run a holodeck program to simulate the right season and that should get you a set really quickly.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** For the counselor... I think I need to discuss the options with Zox and Murry alone<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I think in the future I might need to adjust the controls a little so they are easier for you to reach with your peculiar hands. I did not properly account for those in the design. My apologies for thinking somewhat humanoid mammalian in my thinking.<br />

**Rhuk:** One does not drag me across space to exclude me from conversations.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Meanwhile, Malat, Kolea, and I will work on the baby shower plans!<br />
*Rhuk looks stoically at Dr. Zerra*<br />
**Captain Baras:** Ma'am, the Federation has robust patient privacy regulations. I think it would be best if we honored Zox and Murry's privacy in this case.<br />
**Rhuk:** Zox has nothing he wouldn't share with hhis brood.<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Well, on the plus side we really don't need to inspect down there…wait, where did Zox go?<br />
>The away team soon rounds a corner to find Commander Zox wrapped up by a large snake-like creature emerging from a hole in the shaft wall.<br />

**Kolea:** I've had fantasies about things like this!<br />
>Zox bashes the snake against the rocks, tearing open its flesh and releasing still more gas<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Commander Murry to Lister, we need two things. We need to be beamed out. And we should pretend this was a resounding success.<br />
>Skig materializes Zox in the containment system.<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** It looks like something is… rewriting the Commander's DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I have one hope for a treatment: a live donor. According to your personel file, your Mother lives on a colony less than 12 light years from here<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I...feel a little lightheaded and weak. Like I want to sleep on a heat rock, but more than normal.<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Hailey, you were supposed to pull away, not towards.<br />
>Skig transports Murry out of the forcefield, setting it for a full infection scan to make sure she is not infected with the same thing Zox has.<br />

**Lt. Malat:** Zox, are you OK in there? The atmostphere in there reads as highly toxic, but your life signs are stable.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Your alveoli appear to be binding with the flourine in the gas.<br />
>Hailey Murry chills in her containment field, listening into the discussion via her comms<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Commander Murry I have some good new and some… odd news. The good news is that you don't seem to have any genetic damage.<br />
>Dr. Zerra pulls up a scan of a clutch of eggs in Commander Murry's abdomen<br />

>Hailey Murry steps up to look through the field in horror<br />

![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Congratulations!<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Not again<br />
>Just then, Captain Baras enters Sickbay with an older Voth female<br />

**Rhuk:** What are you hiding from me?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I'm not hiding anything, really, I just don't want you to worry about things that we don't have to worry about<br />
**Lt. Malat:** It's just getting to the good part, I want to see how Murry explains the Voth eggs in her belly<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Who am I to question what the Counselor and Chief of Security do in their “free” time?<br />
**Rhuk:** What what? Voth eggs in that small creature?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It was via the transporters. It has to have been.<br />
**Rhuk:** Iss that what they are calling it now?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I didn't think to check the first time, I just assumed… But these eggs don't seem to contain any of the Counselor's DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I think they need a little privacy to discuss their options<br />
>And now... the conclusion<br />

>♫♫♫Dramatic Music String♫♫♫<br />

>Captains Log, supplemental: Murry and Zox are both in stable condition for now. Dr. Zerra is continue Zox's treatment, but is still investigating a safe procedure to remove the... lifeforms from Counselor Murry. In the meantime, I ordered both of them to take some time off. Zox has been spending some time with his mother, and Counselor Murry seems to be hiding from her in Holodeck 4.
 Just to be on the safe side, I've ordered the transporters shut down until we understand what happened. Skig is leading the investigation in transporter room 2.<br />

>INTERIOR - Transporter Room 2: Skig has torn the transporter pad down to its frame looking for the cause of the malfunction that definitely couldn't have possibly been user error in any way and MUST have absolutely been a malfunction, 100%. She's not projecting, you're projecting.<br />

**Rhuk:** Wait, do huumans really do...that through their noses?<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Apparently yes. I had no idea really!<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No, I don't think that is possible<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am still fairly certain that the transporter is responsible and not any ordinary biological contamination<br />
*Zox makes confused reptile noises.*<br />
**Oakadan:** I'll have to second that<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Then...can't we just reverse this problem?<br />
**Oakadan:** Wouldn't that cause her to make you pregnant? <br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Dr. Zerra is still working on it, we aren't sure how to remove the eggs just yet<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Beam the eggs out of Murry and into you? I think there is some sort of ethical discussion that needs to happen by people who care about biological processes.<br />
*Rhuk is confused and not really sure if her son had a fling or not.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Also, the eggs are mostly alien DNA. I don't know that would be wise<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Do we not have some sort of incubator? Can we not Engineer one?<br />
*Skig shows Viraseti some data she found.*<br />
**Oakadan:** Hmmm, we may want to get one ready just in case<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** It can't be safe for those to be in a person.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I think there was some sort of residual biological material trapped in the transporter filter and it might have mixed with Murry's DNA during the emergency transport.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** This would not happen normally, as it should have been cycled into the normal transporter process for review prior to materialization.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** At least, that's my current hypothesis.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, the transporter biofilter safeties should have prevented that<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If this contaminant evaded the biofilter, it may not be safe to use the transporter until we can ensure it is completely eradicated<br />
**Oakadan:** Is there something currently trapped in the transporter's biofilter? <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** This reminds me of the prank that Ensign Peterson pulled where he had every female who used the transporter on odd numbered days and even numbered hours to suddenly develop "D Cups".<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Hrm...Would it be possible to use a shuttle's transporter bay?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good thinking, the shuttle systems are isolated from the Lister<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They shouldn't have been infected<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** But I agree, Lt Cmdr, until we can be certain that somehow this is not replicating to everyone who has used the transporter, we should not use them until we can run a full diagnostic.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Yes, the shuttles run a separate transporter grid.<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Oakadan): Oh no, is the Lister pregnant as well? </font><br />
*Skig pulls up a list of everyone who has gone through the transporter since Murry's "accident".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** No time to waste! A standard bio-reactor should be close enough for those eggs.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Hmm... we should check to see if Rhuk is pregnant with these eggs also.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Skig, would you lend me a hand on this real quick?<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** The ship just got.... herpes.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** is it more like Eggzema?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps the contamination is worse than we thought<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Yes, yes it is.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** "Steak dinner for one, please."<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Viraseti, can that to see if the replicator has the same instance of biocontaminant.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): "scan" not "can"</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Well, I think we are going to have to use a shuttle to beam everyone through a custom biofilter and remove eggs from 90% of the crew.<br />
**Oakadan:** We may want to do a scan of the crew to see if it's spread. I don't think anybody's actually used the transporters, but they've definitely used the incubaters.<br />
>The replicator whirs to life and produces another egg, this one superimposed over the first . As the replicator struggles to materialize two objects in the same space, it starts to make a groaning sound and the eegs both explode, showering the transporter room in a pale yellow goop<br />

*Oakadan gives the Lt Cmdr some goggles*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The eggs have a similar biosignature to the ones we detected in yourself and Counselor Murry, I think this plan of yours might work<br />

>INTERIOR - Crew Quarters, Deck 8: Counselor Murry, Lt. Jg. Caiveka, and Murry's mother-in-law (?) are standing over a strange snake/Voth hybrid creature which is currently softly groaning on the floor in the doorway of Caiveka's quarters.
The hallway is lit only by the dim glow of the red alert indicators and the pulsing blue emergency illumination.

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** After seeing daring feats of Bocce ball prowess, i figured Laak would impress me with a display of nimble grace, not fall to the floor lifeless.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** You shouldn't just throw injured men onto your shoulders and go running about the ship<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox might not have been aware full ship systems have been restored. However, I will run a level 3 diagnostic to make sure the purge was successful.<br />
*Skig begins playing Minesweeper on her terminal to make it look like she is busy while the automated process runs.*<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** On purpose<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** While cackling about stealing a shuttlecraft and escaping<br />
**Rhuk:** Have you talked to her about it? do you really know what she was thinking at the time?<br />
*Skig sits down across from Hailey and pulls out a flask.*<br />
**Rhuk:** Maybe you should talk to her over drinks. You may a totally different person than the one you have constructed in your head.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I thought "The good of the me outweighs the good of the others." was pretty clear, didn't you?<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And Neraran isn't the type that you rehabilitate<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She is the type you stay well clear of until you are paroled<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, I was thinking we might want to do some remedial training on the proper use of Magetic Boots and explosive clamps.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Very funny Commander<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It has been 20 years since I took EVA Fundamentals at the academy, there are a lot of buttons on those pads<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, I did check and the suit you were wearing did have a faulty backup battery which was wired incorrectly and probably triggered a short on the helmet release. I've assigned some crew to run a full diagnostic on all the suits.<br />
**Rhuk:** I have read in Earth philosophy that people do not willingly desire bad things - I demand that you talk to Neraran directly and resolve this as members of starfleet working towards a common goal of peace and prosperity.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Actually, that might be fun for a group bonding exercise! <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And yes, the fact that it has been 20 years means it is a good time to practice again.<br />

*Hailey Murry plans for a rehabilitation session where she can get everyone in the bay, shut off the shields, and have them scramble to get their helmets on, boots active, and save anyone who gets vented*<br />
*Zox sits down Malat and Neraran at a table and buys them drinks, and implores they make peace.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Make peace with your choice of fermented concoction.<br />
*Zox has coached Neraran on playing nice if she wants a probationary post.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'll notify Nurse Kolea to be ready for two patients<br />
*Hailey Murry didn't witness any of Neraran's shenanigans, but has seen her sheet and counseled her. She takes her leave from the bar as Neraran sits down to avoid the resulting issues*<br />
*Laak sits alone in his cell, sighing and waiting for company*<br />

**Neraran:** You clearly missed the amazing list of my achievements during the Dominion War.<br />
*Rhuk is on standby with top notch negotiating diplomacy.*<br />
**Neraran:** I'm singlehandedly responsible for more than ten thousand Gem Hadar fatalities on Betazed.<br />
*Zox is on standby with handcuffs and phasers.*<br />
*Zox is also appreciative of Kolea's talents being on standby.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We're not at war anymore, and last time I checked the Starfleet general orders, "creating weapons of mass destruction" isn't in there<br />
**Rhuk:** Ah, but the way to prevent the next war is to prepare for it, no?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Starfleet doesn't use chemical weapons nor condone mass murder. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we sacrifice our values to win a war, what kind of victory is that?<br />
**Neraran:** You must have missed the Dominion War while you were in jail.<br />
**Neraran:** Meh, Values are fluid.<br />
*Lt. Malat stands up*<br />
**Neraran:** The good of the many outweighs the good of the few, Malat.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I spent 9 months on AR-558. If you want to question my record, you should read it first<br />
