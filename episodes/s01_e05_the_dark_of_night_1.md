>Captain's log, stardate 61206.7. Our mission to the Kalandra nebula was thankfully uneventful. None of the senior staff have been fatally wounded nor destroyed any major portions of the ship. We are now en route to Starbase 310 for our next assignment. In the meantime, Commander Bachar has suggested that we use the time to evaluate the senior staff in a readiness excercise.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Assemble your team and get down to transporter room 2.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I suggest we play for their life support to be compromoised and bring both suits for ourselves and any sort of recessitation tools at our disposal.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Captain, I believe, Security Chief Zox, Lt. Oakadan, Nurse Kolea, and whatever additional security forces Zox feels are appropriate.<br />
*Zox instructs Kolea to bring a lot of life-support stuff.*<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Use this for power, I don't need it. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Even just a little bit to find out what happened here.<br />
*Skig uses Zox's tricoder to power up a terminal to pull up the security logs.*<br />
**Kurij:** Between the huge tractor beam emitter and the logs, it seems like this is a salvage ship sent out here to pick something up which wasn't as intended. There's probably something of interest in the cargo bays<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, Dr Zerra, can you pinpoint the faint lifesigns we detected from the Lister?<br />
*Zox Nods at Kurij but looks intent at deciphering something on a screen.*<br />
*Skig reports back to Captain Baras to keep him informed.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am reading 1, possibly 2 lifesigns around 400 meters aft of our position<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig - It appears these Taganite's were salvaging a federation vessel. Shortly after taking it aboard, they appear to have all gone mad. Dr. Zerra, can you monitor our stress and aggression hormone levels and report any changes - I suspect whatever is on that ship is partially responsible.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well your agression hormones are off the chart, but that is consistent with your last physical<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It is not listed. They are poor scribes<br />
**Kurij:** It'll be a good idea to remain in suits for now as well<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The suits may not protect against sound and light based hypnosis weapons. Be careful.<br />
*Zox races after what might seem to be some motion down a dark corridor.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Captain, the Taganites were salvaging a Federation vessel. Do we have access to Federation logs for vessels in the area that have gone missing or been destroyed lately and what their most recent assignments were?<br />
*Skig walks along behind bullrushing Zox, being cautious and scanning for movement and atmospheric or environmental anomalies.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Nothing recently, but we lost many ships in this area during the war<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Understood Captain, thank you.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I can have the twins start to put together a list of ships lost in this area<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That might be helpful while we collate more data.<br />
**Kurij:** If I can get eyes on the vessel that's probably in the cargo bay, I can probably narrow down the search a lot<br />
**Kurij:** I've seen a lot of different ships<br />
**Kurij:** Who here thinks we should split up?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Let's head to the lifesigns first and see if there are people to rescue. Then we will move into the cargo area and get you that information.<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Kurij): Your directions are north, south, east, and Dennis</font><br />

**Kurij:** Sounds like a plan. What are the odds that something's still active in here? <br />
