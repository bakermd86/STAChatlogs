>INTERIOR - Station K4 Observation Deck: After being shot down and yelled at by Commander Bachar before he could even explain his plan to go question Kosal Oram, Zox meets back up with his co-conspirators to disscus their next move.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She just shot you down completely? I would get it if she did that to me, but she likes you. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or, well maybe not "likes" you, but she respects you at least. I think.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Something doesn't seem right here.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Then I suppose we have no choice but to drop the matter and return to our quarters<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Never, my quarters do not overlook the Lister, someone put me on the opposite side of the station.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 attempt to wink at Zox and Murry, but largely fail to pull off the maneuver*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I think I'm going to switch spots with Throk, he is overlooking the Lister.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 take out a few small chips from the interface unit installed in their brains and attach one each to the back of Zox, Murry, and Throk's necks*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Oh, and skig too</font><br />

>After a short, sharp pain, Murry, Zox, Skig and Throk all see a flash or light and then they are standing in some sort of weird void with the twins and Ishemok<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** In light of the Commander's surveilance, we have established a local area neural network for us to continue this conversation<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is not my fault the tables in the Officer's Club are more comfortable than the floor, also, I can watch the Lister as I drift off to sleep.<br />
**Ishemok:** Woo hoo! LAN party!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed<br />
**Throk:** Throk not have LAN party in long time. Last time Throk ate all CAT-3 pink cables. They taste like raspberries.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Thank you, commanders. Now, how shall we proceed here?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** ...and that's when he was trasnferred to security.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, we agree with your assessment that something is unusual about the situation<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our expectation based on the available data is that Commander Bachar would approve of further investigatory actions agains the Aldazed Cartel <br />
**Throk:** Since Ledger come from experience of Commander Bachar being captured, can only assume she is complicit in activity of Cartel, therefore, would not want further investigation.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's pretty common knowledge that she was in intelligence before being assigned to the Lister. It's possible that she's aware of things going on in that front which we aren't<br />
**Throk:** Also, Throk assume blue objects always cold, so Throk assumption not always best one.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm. One explanation is that there's somethign she doesn't want starfleet to know about. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah she left Starfleet Intelligence and transfered to the fleet years ago, whatever she knows is way too far out of date to be meaningful<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Assuming she actually left Starfleet Intelligence, yeah<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** She doesn't happen to have any saved funds in any of this stuff, does she? <br />
**Throk:** Throk not sure when Starfleet exhibit signs of Intelligence, after all, Starfleet let me in.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's definetly an idea, but one generally doesn't rise through the ranks so young if latinum motivates them<br />
**Ishemok:** No double dealing detected. end of line.<br />
**Ishemok:** also no triple dealing detected. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** My nose tells me it's reputational, not financial damage that motivates this secrecy.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oh if we're trashing her reputation, I'm all in for that <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We're not trashing her reputation without very rock hard evidence that it deserves to be trashed<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We should not allow ourselves to be motivated by animus Lieutenant<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not everyone can recover from dozens of demotions<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is also possible that there is an entirely innocent explanation <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, I'm rather opposed to trashing her hard-ass obnoxiousness.<br />
*Zox blinks.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is quite possible she knows things about the Cartel that will get us all killed and and cannot tell us about them.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Im not sure organized crime knows much innocence.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Organized crime specializes in innocence. Those are the easiest people to prey on<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The likelihood of Bachar actually not being in Starfleet Intelligence any more is about the same as me requesting transfer from the Lister.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, given some of our recent assignments, I doubt the Lister is getting randomly generated "go do something missions", there are ulterior motives at play. <br />
*Skig winks at GM.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, we don't know why she was transferred out, but we do know she was sought out by the cartel so it's fair to assume they're part of the reason why<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are considering alternatives, and we are not sure that we have much choice but to continue on our current path. With the captain indisposed, we cannot raise the matter up our chain of command without Commander Bachar's approval. And we do not know how long this intelligence will be actionable.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, the question is, can we head out and act on some of this while remaining incognito? <br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Kosal Oram</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, if I remain behind, with say, your communicators scattered around and that is how Bachar is tracking you, and I make an effort to annoy her while making it look like you are all avoiding her, that will likely get you extra time to make the quick tricks around.<br />
**Ishemok:** What if we cook the books and transfer shares of Prophet's Fortune to the Ferengi Federation?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think that is just stealing<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If the Aldazed cartel are as competent as they appear, it is highly likely that will be made aware of the financial records we queried. So whatever we do, we should assume that the intelligence is fleeting<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think that'd be pretty hilarious stealing, though<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not sure it helps us learn anything though<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It'll piss off the cartel, though<br />
**Throk:** Throk know of Bajoran Vogon Poetry Appreciation Competition, Throk can apply to participate and use that as excuse to leave space station.<br />
**Throk:** Throk love good Vogon Poetry.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Will it though? Do they actually care about this talent agency? It seems like the thing they really care about is the station, and that is just owned by this Oram guy<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** At least on paper<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh, true, it's not actually through the talent agency<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is also why he was transferred to security, as use of Vogon Poetry is considered an interrogation technique so heinous, even the Dominion banned it.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe Throk can get some info out of this guy with his poetry then<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long would it take for us to pay Kosal a visit? <br />
**Ishemok:** Rule 45: Expand or Die. I think this pension fund is in need of buy-out and subsequent auduting. <br />
*Lt. Malat chuckles*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It depends what vessel we are able to secure use of. At the moment, we have no means of travel<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Right, so step 1, decide where you are going. Step 2, find excuse to leave station, Step 3, I get the Lister repaired.<br />
**Ishemok:** We can't act overtly, but if we give some 'free' advice to a competing fund.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The station does have several Danube class runabouts, capable of reaching Bajor in less than a day<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But without the Commander's approval we do not know how we would secure their usage.<br />
**Throk:** Throk go fill in application form for poetry tournament!<br />
*Throk happliy trundles off.*<br />
**Ishemok:** Think of all the panic and volitility to take advantage of if people knew their pension fund was fueling an illegal drug lab teeming with slave labor?<br />
*Throk stops.*<br />
>Throk wanders off into the dark inky void of the computer world<br />

**Throk:** So... they bought into American Pharmaceutical corporations?<br />
**Throk:** They common enough Ishemok, I think for true crime need to also include Swiss banking.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do you think we can convince her that we're taking Skig off planet to get her away from the Lister? <br />
**Ishemok:** Those would have been a safe bet, if not for their collapse in 2052.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** NEVER.<br />
*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** See? Throk can pick her up, and then we can basically get her out of peoples' hair<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It would explain the large retinue<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wait didn't Kolea request a bereavement leave to notify J'Davir's parents of his death?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If she hasn't left yet, maybe she can give us a ride, take a detour to Bajor and drop us off<br />
*Skig makes note to set Murry's room to run at a constant 57C and the shower to emit a high pitched murderous screech noise when activated.*<br />
**Ishemok:** That makes sense, but certainly Bachar has eyes all over Bajor, given the war.<br />
*Hailey Murry is oblivious to this plan for now, but has been around the block already and knows how things turned out to the last person who messed with her shower*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think she has eyes all over it, though if we hit the headlines she'd probably know<br />
*Skig is prepared to vent Murry to space in the event Murry blows up parts of the Lister, AGAIN.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Then again, so would Captain Baras<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If Bajor is our only option<br />
*Throk is confused why all the rooms and doors in this place are black.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...then well, it's our only option<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well if Kolea gives us a ride, it would be hard to justify a "quick" detour into Cardassian space to visit a derelict space station<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we want to do that, we need to secure our own ride<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think Bajor is a better option, I don't really want anyone to go investigate a strange space station we know nothing about<br />
*Throk finds a room with a mirror and starts talking to handsome Gorn who is not giving him directions how to leave this weird limbo land he is in.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How many people can we sneak onto Kolea's shuttle?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Assuming a standard Danube layout without science labs, it has room for 6 passengers<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Since the Lister has no shuttles, I assume she would get a Runabout.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, what Malat said.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, we can sneak over, or we can check to see if we can head over for a training exercise<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Parrises squares teams are 5 people...<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The problem with Parrises Squares, is if you get hurt, the injuries are distinct.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And they would not go un-noticed by Bachar.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** They would not go un-noticed by Dr Zerra, you mean<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Bachar doesn't necessarily have to find out<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The only place eyes aren't, is in here.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Could be a good plan.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But do be cautious<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Assuming Skig can piss off the commander enough to keep her attention while we slip out unnoticed<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't know if we can sneak out if she's keeping an eye on people as much as she claims, especially if she's keeping an ear on us as well<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, if that's the best we got.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I think we physically all need to relocate to a holodeck for a while, and then if you all happen to take the connecting maintenance tube and follow that to the shuttle bay, then jump into Kolea's shuttle before she departs that would be fine. You would need to leave various trackable options with me in the holodeck.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Look on the bright side: If Bachar is hiding something, it's not like she can report you up the chain of command for ignoring her orders<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Then I'll just constantly insist Bachar review all the maintenance logs for the last twenty four hours.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We should probably also change out of our uniforms into civilian clothes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Mostly because I don't think these maintenance crews are properly motivated. It is like they don't want to work with the smell of charred enlisted people in main engineering.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't they realize how important it is to get that smell out of the area so the chemicals causing the odor don't interfere with the warp calibration!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm. For a second, i thought I was cold blooded.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nothing. Nothing at all.<br />
