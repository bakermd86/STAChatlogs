![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you, Skig. Nice work<br />

**Zox:  [d20 = 6]**<br />
**Zox:  [2d6 = 6]**<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** My word Commander, you need to call these things in<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We have stretcherrs<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And transporters<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Also: this man has massive contusions on his head, he could have a broken neck from a fall this bad<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** After seeing daring feats of Bocce ball prowess, i figured Laak would impress me with a display of nimble grace, not fall to the floor lifeless.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** You shouldn't just throw injured men onto your shoulders and go running about the ship<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox might not have been aware full ship systems have been restored. However, I will run a level 3 diagnostic to make sure the purge was successful.<br />
*Skig begins playing Minesweeper on her terminal to make it look like she is busy while the automated process runs.*<br />
*Zox deposits people in med bay, begins filling out paper work to field promote Neraran and assign her to the mining colony as an extermination expert.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that was slightly terrifying<br />
>INTERIOR - Crew Lounge: The crew head to the crew lounge to unwind and relax after a truly crazy mission. <br />

*Hailey Murry is on her fourth drink*<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  COMMAND  (3)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 25]**<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Malat; Starfleet has taught me to judge people by their strengths and talents, together we are all stronger. The mining colony planetside needs someone like her, else another ship may succumb to the same plague we did.<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): By strength and talents, you clearly don't mean throwing skills</font><br />

Success with 0 momentum [d20 = 13]**<br />
**Rhuk:** Most sentient creatures are good and wish the best, Perhaps Neraran just needed an outlet for her talents.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She gassed us<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** On purpose<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** While cackling about stealing a shuttlecraft and escaping<br />
**Rhuk:** Have you talked to her about it? do you really know what she was thinking at the time?<br />
*Skig sits down across from Hailey and pulls out a flask.*<br />
**Rhuk:** Maybe you should talk to her over drinks. You may a totally different person than the one you have constructed in your head.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I thought "The good of the me outweighs the good of the others." was pretty clear, didn't you?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That was slightly more interesting than I expected.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Indeed Commander, membership petitions are usually a bit boring<br />
**Rhuk:** That could have been a translation issue.<br />
**Rhuk: [ PRESENCE  (11) +  COMMAND  (2)]

[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think we should keep Neraran away from alcohol. Or any drugs. Or any chemicals, for that matter<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I've spent a lot of time in lockup. here are two types on the inside<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And Neraran isn't the type that you rehabilitate<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She is the type you stay well clear of until you are paroled<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, I was thinking we might want to do some remedial training on the proper use of Magetic Boots and explosive clamps.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Very funny Commander<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It has been 20 years since I took EVA Fundamentals at the academy, there are a lot of buttons on those pads<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, I did check and the suit you were wearing did have a faulty backup battery which was wired incorrectly and probably triggered a short on the helmet release. I've assigned some crew to run a full diagnostic on all the suits.<br />
**Rhuk:** I have read in Earth philosophy that people do not willingly desire bad things - I demand that you talk to Neraran directly and resolve this as members of starfleet working towards a common goal of peace and prosperity.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Actually, that might be fun for a group bonding exercise! <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And yes, the fact that it has been 20 years means it is a good time to practice again.<br />
**Rhuk: [ PRESENCE  (11) +  COMMAND  (2)]

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Fine, but I'm bringing a phaser<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Just in case<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And a rebreather<br />
*Hailey Murry plans for a rehabilitation session where she can get everyone in the bay, shut off the shields, and have them scramble to get their helmets on, boots active, and save anyone who gets vented*<br />
*Zox sits down Malat and Neraran at a table and buys them drinks, and implores they make peace.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Make peace with your choice of fermented concoction.<br />
*Zox has coached Neraran on playing nice if she wants a probationary post.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'll notify Nurse Kolea to be ready for two patients<br />
*Hailey Murry didn't witness any of Neraran's shenanigans, but has seen her sheet and counseled her. She takes her leave from the bar as Neraran sits down to avoid the resulting issues*<br />
*Laak sits alone in his cell, sighing and waiting for company*<br />
**Kolea:** No problem Dr. Zerra. I'll set up the containment field, the biological purge systems, and get my form-fitted space suit ready.<br />
*Lt. Malat orders a glass of Bajoran Springwine*<br />
**Rhuk:** Sits down next to Neraran.<br />
*Rhuk Sits down next to Neraran.*<br />
*Zox sits down next to Malat*<br />
*Kolea prepares for large numbers of chemical burns and gets out her chemical weapons triage kits.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Rhuk and Zox are convinced you can be a productive member of starfleet. For some reason<br />
**Neraran:** You clearly missed the amazing list of my achievements during the Dominion War.<br />
*Rhuk is on standby with top notch negotiating diplomacy.*<br />
**Neraran:** I'm singlehandedly responsible for more than ten thousand Gem Hadar fatalities on Betazed.<br />
*Zox is on standby with handcuffs and phasers.*<br />
*Zox is also appreciative of Kolea's talents being on standby.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We're not at war anymore, and last time I checked the Starfleet general orders, "creating weapons of mass destruction" isn't in there<br />
**Rhuk:** Ah, but the way to prevent the next war is to prepare for it, no?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Starfleet doesn't use chemical weapons nor condone mass murder. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we sacrifice our values to win a war, what kind of victory is that?<br />
**Neraran:** You must have missed the Dominion War while you were in jail.<br />
**Neraran:** Meh, Values are fluid.<br />
*Lt. Malat stands up*<br />
**Neraran:** The good of the many outweighs the good of the few, Malat.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I spent 9 months on AR-558. If you want to question my record, you should read it first<br />
*Lt. Malat turns and walks away from Neraran*<br />
**Neraran:** If you want to question my record, you should read it first.<br />
**Neraran:** At least, the non-redacted parts.<br />
*Neraran grins.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Planet Malari needs Neraran.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** They can have her<br />
*Lt. Malat spits at Neraran's feet and leaves the lounge*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Then we are agreed! A probatioary assignement under strict supervision!<br />
**Neraran:** I shall be happy to assist them in their problems.<br />
*Neraran grins wider.*<br />
*Dr. Zerra gets up from behind the chair he was hiding beind*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, that was exciting<br />
**Rhuk:** Where would the Federation be if it could not learn to grow with the Cardassian Empire?<br />

*Lt. Malat stops in her tracks and turns back, walking right up to Rhuk's face*<br />
**Neraran:** Out of control tumors caused by chemical agitation are also a form of growth.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't care what I look like, or what's in my DNA. Iam NOT a Cardassian, and I don't want to hear another goddam word out of you right now<br />
*Zox jabs Neraran in the chest, imploring her to stop for a moment.*<br />
*Lt. Malat storms off*<br />
*Neraran calmly folds her hands in her lap and smiles.*<br />
*Zox No gloating. Do not make me granting you a way out of the brig.*<br />

*Kolea nudges Zox.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah I dunno. I expected some violence for you to cure. Sorry if I got you excited.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Also, if I were you, I would go sooner rather than later to that next posting<br />
**Kolea:** That smile she has, I have seen this smile before. It is not a smile that warm-blooded creatures should make.<br />
*Kolea gestures at Neraran, then leaves to tell the medical teams to stand down from emergency mass chemical weapons attack.*<br />

**Kolea:** It was a medical observation.<br />
