>Captain's log, stardate 61131.7: Our mission to the Malari system to review their petition for Federation membership is nearing completion. The planet meets Federation standards for equality, liberty, good governance, and techonological sufficiency. The only out-standing report is the assessment of working conditions, which Commander Zox is spearheading.

Per his latest status report, his survey team has completed random inspections of several Malari facilities, but there is one other facility he selected to inspect: a dilitium mine. I worry that Zox is perhaps being overly susicious of the Malari, but I suppose that is to be expected. Regardless, once his inspection is complete we should be ready to break orbit and submit our recommendation to Starfleet Command regarding the Malari membership petition.<br />

*Hailey Murry Also, nothing says "I belong on a mining facility" like a demolitions focus*<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Also, nothing says "I belong on a mining facility" like a demolitions focus</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Mining Facility: The Malari mining crew chief Tumarara is showing Zox and the away team around the mining facility. The facility itself is very impressive, a number of tunnels converge on a large underground chamber where workers operate automated drones to procces the raw dilithium ore and package it for transport<br />

**Tumarara:** Are you satisfied yet Commander? As I explained on the surface, all of the dangerous tasks are handled by out unmanned drones. Now if you are done, we need to get back to work. We have a schedule to keep here.<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): characters were unbelievably competent last episdode, limiting the drama. Clearly we need to be more imperfect for good drama.</font><br />
**Zox:** I tend to distrust those who rush a good inspection.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Last week things went far too well, we had a ratings slump so we need more conflict and incompetence.</font><br />
**Tumarara:** I tend to distrust inspectors, they are usually more interested in their next promotion than the truth<br />
**Tumarara:** This facility has a spotless safety record<br />
*Zox 's eye slits narrow on Tumarara*<br />
**Zox:** Im taking my crew down these auxiliary shafts.<br />
**Kolea:** I sometimes ride auxiliary shafts.<br />

**Zox:** Yes.<br />
**Tumarara:** Well I'm not going down there, I am not an idiot<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Well, on the plus side we really don't need to inspect down there if people aren't usually down there. Unless there's something suspicious being hidden down there...wait, where did Zox go? <br />

>As he proceeds deeper down the shaft, there is no evidence of the life signs he detected from the main chamber<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh goodness<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Should we follow the commander?<br />

*Kolea hands out medical masks to the rest of the group.*<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** Good thinking nurse. Better safe than sorry, that's what I always say<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Thank goodness, thank you Kolea. Let's see if we can get our commander one as well. <br />

**Kolea:** I shall happy see you dead in bed.<br />
*Lt. Malat puts on her Verizon(tm) breather aparatus*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Commander Zox? Can you read me? If you could inform us on the direction you went, that would be fantastic<br />
*Kolea gives MacAllister a wink.*<br />
*Lt. Malat pulls out her tricorder*<br />
**Lt. Malat:** I'm reading his life signs 200 meters this way Counselor<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Fantastic, let's head over that way. Are there any other life signs down here as well or is it just his?<br />
*Kolea follows dutifully along, scanning for life signs and particulate matter or dangerous effects.*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Oof. </font><br />
>The away team soon rounds a corner to find Commander Zox wrapped up by a large snake-like creature emerging from a hole in the shaft wall. Approximately 7 meters of snake are visible, but its tail is still inside the wall<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh goodness! Commander Zox!<br />
**Kolea:** I've have fantasies about things like this!<br />
>The snake-creature continues to crush Zox in its grasp, but Zox is stronk<br />

*Kolea scans the gas for its chemical/biological properties and tries to collect a sample for analysis.*<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** What the hell is that thing?<br />
*Kolea scans for the snake to see if it is registering as a lifeform or a construct also.*<br />
*Zox scrambles up the tunnel, signaling a 'get out of here' with hand signals/*<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Does anybody know what those are?<br />
**Kolea:** Wow, that must have been at least 18m long, based on Crewman Thompson informing me exactly what 6" is!<br />
*Zox takes a defensive position.*<br />
*Lt. Malat sets her phaser to the maximum setting and fires into the hole that the creature dissapeared down*<br />

**Skig:** Yes<br />
*Zox looks relieved on hearing this.*<br />
**Kolea:** Great, and while I have your attention Skig, would rampant phaser fire in a mine filled with Dilitium Crystal dust trigger chemical reactions that could cause the collapse of the mine system?<br />
**Skig:** Your call is very important to us, please hold for the next available operator.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Skig, don't even think about it<br />
**Kolea:** Dammit!<br />
*Skig raises eyebrow and Commander Bachar's remark. Skig will think about whatever the Hell Skig feels like thinking about.*<br />
>As the tunnel continues to destablize, a huge geyser of gas erupts from the wall, obscuring the away team's vision (and breathing for the one member not wearing a breather)<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** The hydrogen and flourine, on the other hand<br />
**Kolea:** Umm... I meant, as in, "We have been firing phasers around and I would like to know what would cause the mine to collapse."<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Which way is the exit? I can't see a damn thing<br />
**Skig:** It's okay Kolea, I knew what you meant.<br />

**Drone:** Command override accepted, initiating venting procedure<br />
**Kolea:** Or didn't bother to install fans and venting systems?<br />
**Kolea:** I'm pretty sure that would need to be posthumously included in your report.<br />

>A crumbling sound is heard, and the ceiling caves in over Kolea's head, dumping a massive pile of rocks on her fragile form<br />

![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Alright, so<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Commander Murry to Lister, we need two things<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We need to be beamed out<br />
**Skig:** Okay, what can we do to help?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** And we should pretend this was a resounding success<br />
**Skig:** Got it, straight to sick bay or to a normal transporter room?<br />
*Zox is now convinved Kolea has a bigger crush on him than the SpaceSnek(TM)*<br />
**Lt. Malat:** I agree with the counselor. Snitches get stiches<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Sick bay, please, we should probably all get a look over<br />
**Skig:** I'm reporting this as a resounding success for testing out the transporters and the efficacy of the rebreathing equipment.<br />
*Crewman McAllister breathes a sign of relief that it was Kolea who got crushed by the rocks and not him, because he doubts Zox would have risked his life to save him*<br />
*Skig activates the transporter to send the entire Away Team to a medical bay with quarantine features to prevent spread of airborne contaminants.*<br />
>The transporters dematerialize the away team and they rematerialize in sickbay<br />

>All except Zox, who is absent when the away team re-appear<br />

**Skig:** Counselor, are you arrived and, I assume Lt. Commander Zox is...<br />
**Skig:** Hmm....<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** So, I suppose we should probably double check if that was intentional venting of --where is Zox?<br />
*Dr. Zerra gets Kolea up onto a bed and... begins scanning her with his medical tricorder*<br />
**Skig:** Lt. Commander Zox is being held in the transporter buffer as he is carrying some level of contaminant that is not identifiable or purgeable via transporter.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I'll set up a level 4 containment field<br />
*Dr. Zerra establishes a containment field around the diagnostic bay*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** We're ready here whenever you are commander<br />
**Skig:** Thank you Doctor, I shall begin the transport now.<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): oh no. SpaceSnek Fever.</font><br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Fen - Planning this episode, The only person susceptible to this DNA-altering SpaceSnek poison would be Zox, how can I possibly convince Tack that Zox needs to get constricted and poisoned by one of these?.... 5 minutes into the episode... nevermind.</font><br />
*Skig materializes Zox in the containment system.*<br />
*Dr. Zerra orders another nurse to take care of Kolea and turns his attention to Zox*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Interesting. There are no foreign organisms present, that must be why the transporter couldn't remove it. It looks like something is... rewriting the Commander's DNA<br />
**Kolea ***(thrashes in her sleep)*: Yes master, whip me more, I really like it when you do that.<br />
**Skig:** More herbivorous or carnivorous?<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): "Whip me herbivorously"</font><br />
**Skig:** Just need to know if I should reprogram the food synthesizers.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Hard to say Commander, I can give him an injection of a cellular inhibitor for now, it should slow down the genetic damage.<br />
*Dr. Zerra gives Zox two injections, and he starts to wake back up*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I'll have to do some further research to come up with a treatment plan<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** But this is very serious, if we don't find a way to reverse the genetic damage, there's no telling what could become of the commander<br />

>After the credits, the Captain has come to sickbay to discuss the situation with his senior staff<br />

**Captain Baras:** How are you feeling Commander?<br />
**Zox:** Hissssterical. All squirmy.<br />
**Captain Baras:** Dr, is he fit for duty?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I can't tell if he's feeling normal or if he's actually feeling different<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Impossible to say, normal for Zox is hard to pin down<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** As for his fitness for duty, if he is feeling up to it, I would not object. But I would insist that he wear a bio-monitor<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I need to be able to monitor his condition<br />
**Zox:** Can you explain this condition?<br />
*Dr. Zerra pulls up a monitor and swivels it over so Zox can see, then sits down at his bedside*<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Kolea): Well, see, your normal cells are the green ones, the blue ones are the infected cells, and the red ones are where the blinky thing next to the light relay system needed extra contrast.</font><br />
**Dr. Zerra:** This is your genetic fingerprint that we have on file from your last physical, and this is your DNA sequences now. As you can see, something in the venom from that creature began the process of rewriting your base pairs. <br />
**Zox:** While I know the technology has been banned since the Eugenics wars of Terra, can't you just over-write the re-wiriting since you have it all on file?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** We've filtered out the venom, but the process appears to be self-sustaining now<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** That is my hope, but our systems cannot sythesize viable Voth DNA<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I have one hope for a treatment: a live donor<br />
*Skig is pretty certain whoever wrote Dr. Zerra's lines is the same person who wants to her claim that the global variable declarations for the warp containment system need capital letters to show importance.*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** According to your personel file, your Mother lives on a colony less than 12 light years from here<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** With yours and the captain's permission, I'd like to take a detour there<br />
