<font color="##005500">Masakari (Rhuk): BRB RQ</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Crew Quarters, Deck 8: Counselor Murry, Lt. Jg. Caiveka, and Murry's mother-in-law (?) are standing over a strange snake/Voth hybrid creature which is currently softly groaning on the floor in the doorway of Caiveka's quarters.
The hallway is lit only by the dim glow of the red alert indicators and the pulsing blue emergency illumination. Down the hall to the left they can hear scratching and hissing, and see shadows cast from the direction of the holodeck entrance, fading in and out with the flickering of the faint emergency lights.<br />

*Caiveka grabs her actual Bat'leth from the wall and sets down her "training one" she grabbed by accident.*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Rhuk): function to use number of controlled characters to auto assign colors with the most possible color distance to their dice sets = IDEA.</font><br />
*Caiveka decapitates the creature.*<br />
**Caiveka:** RARGH!<br />
<img align="left" src="../images/murry.png" >**Hailey Murry:** Caiveka, what's the fastest way up to the bridge? <br />
**Caiveka:** FOR THE GLORY OF THE EMPIRE!<br />
<img align="left" src="../images/murry.png" >**Hailey Murry:** Ideally a way where we can block off the way behind --oh god, you got it all over my pants<br />
**Caiveka:  [Damage: 8] [Effects: 5] [7dChallenge = 8]**<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Rhuk): VAPED.</font><br />

*Caiveka runs forward with her Bat'leth.*<br />
**Caiveka:** And they said there would be no exciting challenges during this time on the officer exchange program!<br />
<img align="left" src="../images/murry.png" >**Hailey Murry:** Caiveka! This way, we need your courage to lead the way up to the bridge<br />
*Caiveka chops through the creatures, hacking through its limbs and severing all visible body parts.*<br />

**Caiveka:** You shall die with honour scaly reptilian woman!<br />
**Caiveka:** But why didn't you grab one of the other weapons from my quarters first?<br />
<img align="left" src="../images/murry.png" >**Hailey Murry:** Caiveka! Get it's back knee so it can't brace!<br />

<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): This is an innocent, if convenient, mistake</font><br />
**Caiveka:** Err... which "It"?  You were not specific and there were four knees to choose from?<br />
<img align="left" src="../images/murry.png" >**Hailey Murry:** You struck her head?!<br />
>Caiveka takes a big swing at the creature attacking Rhuk, but misses. Her bat'leth bounces off the door frame and cracks into Rhuk's head hard<br />

**Caiveka:** Also, I sensed some animosity towards your mother-in-law, so I thought maybe you meant both of them?<br />
**Caiveka:** These Federation Door Frames are not well sized for wide swinging weapons.<br />
<img align="left" src="../images/murry.png" >**Hailey Murry:** No! Hostility or no, she's a diplomatic guest upon this vessel and our honor is dependent on her survival<br />
**Caiveka:** I see, I guess I missed that part of the briefing.<br />
>Another of the creatures comes out of the holodeck and drags Rhuk back towards the holodeck, several more come slinking out of the doors and head towards Murry and Caiveka<br />

**Hailey Murry ***(yells from out of screen)*: Given the recent turns of events, I really don't think she is!<br />
**Rhuk:** These things are a pain in the hindquarters, im saurus all over.<br />
**Caiveka:** Excellent! The pain gives me strength to strike you all down!<br />
*Caiveka looks at Rhuk.*<br />

**Caiveka:** She doesn't like you and was non-specific.<br />
