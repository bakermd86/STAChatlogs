*Skig sacrifices Hailey Murry to the ion storms to appease them.*<br />
*Skig toss in Veraseti also, to cover any potential reputation loss.*<br />
**Skig:** The good of the Skig outweighs the good of the few.<br />
*Zox begins to ponder this cosmic trolley problem.*<br />
<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): arrives late on set</font><br />
>Skig pulls out her tricorder and runs a detailed analysis of the aparatus. There is no obvious control system, nor any visible power source. It seems like the containment field is being powered by the energy of the ionic life-forms directly. Skig can see no easy way to shut down the containment system without killing the life forms inside. Somehow, she must find some way to disrupt the containment field without draining the life forms of their bio-energy.<br />

**Skig:** Is it feasible to overload the containment field and cause it to fail-open?<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Is it feasible to overload the containment field and cause it to fail-open?</font><br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We may be able to destroy the device's power grid if we can somehow introduce enough external power<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But we would have to be careful that the energy source wasn't harmful to the life-forms<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We may also be able to penetrate the containment just enough for a transporter beam to get a lock on the life-forms inside. Assuming there is anything to lock on to<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Can we get a lock on any of the ones that are outside the containment field? <br />
**Skig:** Good question Hailey, as I'm not sure the transporters have any way to lock on to energy beings.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti takes out her tricorder*<br />
**Zox:** What if we reverse the polarity of the containment field?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** That...could work, depending on how defuse they can get<br />
**Zox:** overloading could be too risky.<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good point, an overload might collapse the field entirely<br />
*Hailey Murry uses her tricorder to scan the field*<br />
**Skig:** The containment field is powered by the life forms, perhaps opening a small hole that would allow them to flee until the system fails from lack of power?<br />
>[TURN] Hailey Murry<br />

**Hailey Murry: [ REASON  (9) +  SCIENCE  (5)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 31]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We could take advantage of the wavelength of the field here. Rather than overload it with power, we can add it in so the additions destructively interfere enough to create gaps. It's a diffuse being, which means it may be able to slip out through even the smaller holes. <br />
*Skig wonders when Hailey developed the ability to interpret Skig's plan into a more concrete example.*<br />
**Skig:** Yes, that would be the option I was aiming for if overloading is too risky.<br />
*Hailey Murry technically earned her PhD in sonochemistry and acoustics*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): That sounds like a pretty good degree.</font><br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So what is the call Commander? <br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns to Commander Skig*<br />
*Zox thinks the situation is under control and in good hands between Hailey and Skig.*<br />
**Skig:** Let's work on using wavelength diffusion to turn the containment field into the electrical version of Swiss cheese.<br />
**Skig:** Hopefully the ionic beings are able to figure out what is going on and can help on their side, I will rig the Universal Translator to see if we can communicate with them and convey our plans to the ones trapped inside.<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ DARING  (11) +  SCIENCE  (5)]
[Focus: Acoustics ]
[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]
Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
*Skig hopes Zox does not use a pachycephalasaurus approach to solving the problem.*<br />
**Zox: [ DARING  (11) +  SCIENCE  (3)]

[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]
Failed on DC: 1 [d20 = 16]**<br />
*Hailey Murry grabs a large, unidentified box from some sort of experimental gadget which has an inexplicably large battery, hooking it up to a radio transponder*<br />
>As Murry adjusts the power frequency from her makeshift interferometer, Commander Viraseti monitors with her tricoder<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Your plan seems to be working counselor, I'm detecting localized gaps in the field integrity<br />
*Skig helpfully rotates the arfram modulation postulator to infarct the hypostatic pneumosis valve.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No sign that the life forms are reacting just yet<br />
*Skig wonders who the heck names these objects.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They may not realize what is happening<br />
**Skig: [ PRESENCE  (8) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]

[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]
Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 9]**<br />
**Zox:** I feel this is under control. I must see to it that the culprit does not escape.<br />
**Zox:** Looks for cuffs/etc to use on Anjek<br />
*Skig arranges the diodes to recalibrate the mucousoidal, no wait, solenoid, valves to make sure it does not sound like they are making warbling turkey noises.*<br />
**Skig:** Hello lifeforms, we have opened some gaps for you to escape, please return to the others.<br />
*Skig gestures towards the hallway.*<br />
>Several tense seconds pass before an arc of lightning jumps from the containment to the mass of energy in the hall<br />

**Zox:** The last energy creature has escaped captivity. The galaxy is at peace.<br />
>Shortly thereafter, a rapid series of arcs fill the room, the thundering is cacophonous, but only lasts a few seconsd. Soon all of the arcs have discharged into the mass of energy in the hall, and the room is silent again<br />

**Skig:** Well done Hailey.<br />
>With the lifeforms gone, the containment field powers down<br />

**Skig:** I think this will not cause peace in the entire galaxy though Zox. At best, we will find our Captain still alive and Anjek covered in no worse than second degree electrical burns.<br />
*Skig taps communicator.*<br />
**Skig:** Captain, how is everything out there?<br />
**Zox:** I see.<br />
>Before the captain can answer, several arcs of lighting lash out from the hallway hitting the away team and momentarily blinding them<br />

*Zox begins to document everything about the lab using a tricorder, in case there are some auto-destruct safeguards against this obviously illegal research about to kick in.*<br />
>When their vision returns, they are standing in main engineering of the pre-refit lister, and Chief Botok is sitting calmly on the central control console<br />

*Hailey Murry blinks the lights out of her eyes*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** What happened there? <br />
**Chief Botok:** With the meat-sacks device deactivated, we thought we might be able to communicate with the skig more easily<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Oh<br />
**Chief Botok:** Their trap caused us great pain, and it was difficult to communicate<br />
**Skig:** I am a little concerned at the use of the word "meat-sacks", but it is nice to be able to speak to you without so much interference.<br />
**Chief Botok:** What word would you prefer? You are semi-permeable sacks full of meat<br />
**Chief Botok:** And if you get too hot, the meat burns<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I believe "carbon-based life forms"is the polite nomenclature<br />
**Skig:** True, but in some situations, meat-sacks implies an intent to eat us.<br />
**Chief Botok:** Do being like yourself eat other meat-beings? <br />
**Chief Botok:** What an inefficient means of getting free energy<br />
**Zox:** Perhaps you have not pondered that we too, are beings of energy, albiet buttressed by much chemistry. Our thoughts and ideas are, after all, merely energy waves; we are not so different.<br />
**Zox: [ PRESENCE  (10) +  COMMAND  (3)]
[Focus: Xenobiology ]
[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]
Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 9]**<br />
**Skig:** I suspect we might not be the healthiest of food sources, but such things aside, how can we, of Starfleet, better understand and coexist with you now that we are able to communicate?<br />
**Chief Botok:** This form of communication is new to us, but your words convey meaning shorter-wavelength carbon-based lifeform<br />
*Chief Botok turns back to Skig*<br />
**Chief Botok:** The life-forms who were here before you are not welcome here. But your kind may return if further communication of this sort is desired<br />
**Skig:** I believe such communication would be fruitful and beneficial to both of our species.<br />
**Zox:** Please do not conclude that all carbon or silicon based life is as capricious as Anjek, who will be punished.<br />
*Zox seems to grin.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** We'll pass on the word to ensure that we can resume more diplomatically<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Is it possible to get a base information exchange, like, "here's an electronic copy of Starfleet basic information, do you have something comparable you can share with us?"</font><br />
*Chief Botok cocks his head quizically *<br />
**Chief Botok:** We must cease communication now, before we do any damage to Skig's meat<br />
**Skig:** I appreciate that<br />
>The engineering deck glows brightly again, then fades to reveal the away team back in Anjek's office. The raging ionic storm clouds and gone. The room is dark and quiet<br />

**Skig:** I sincerely hope this is not a situation where they can only communicate with the rest of Starfleet by sending electrical pulses through my head and giving me a constant migraine.<br />
**Zox:** You must send the specifications for a communication device to Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Not your head, but any Tellarites, I think<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** With the details on your modifications to the universal translator, the corps of engineers should be able to come up with a technological solution<br />
**Skig:** Also, does anyone else have an urge to eat Tim Tams coated in Vegemite while yodeling the word, "Ricola"?<br />
*Zox furiously documents this unlicensed research facility.*<br />

<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Skig's sponsors span several continents.</font><br />
>♫♫♫Lighthearted Music Sting♫♫♫<br />

>---------CUT TO COMMERCIAL-------<br />

<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Evidently Tellerite Chief Engineer snagged several major endorsements between the series pilot and the new season starting.</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Crew Lounge: Skig, Zox and Murry are having a drink with the twins and Dr. Zerra, filling them in on what happened on the away mission<br />

**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It sounds like your experience was most fascinating Commander<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Why do you think that the life-forms used that particular memory to make contact?<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Do you think they felt attacked? <br />
**Skig:** It is a rather unpleasant memory, filled with anguish and loss. It did convey, emotionally, their distress.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** It makes sense, some sort of empathic communication<br />
*Zox lets out a hearty guffaw*<br />
**Skig:** Quite possibly, definitely trapped. It was a pleasant diversion when I first hoped it was an actual opportunity to correct past mistakes temporally.<br />
**Zox:** Skig is soft and furry; battle memories are not pleasant.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Don't let the commander hear you say that, you're already on her bad side and she would give you a 9-point lecture on the Temporal Prime Directive...<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Personally, I place the Hypocratic oath before either Prime Directive. Just don't tell Bachar. I can't speak for you, but that woman scares me<br />
**Skig:** Is it the one that she uses the example of someone going back in time to kill the creator of the Hamsterdance website, which somehow prevented Facebook from ever getting more than 10,000 subscribers before falling into obscurity and allowing humanity to flourish? Much better than the darkest timeline option where they are a global entity by 2021.<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Human history has many dark periods. But If they had not nearly anihillated themselves, then the Federaion itself might not exist<br />
*Skig shrugs again.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Speaking of dark periods, how involved were the other researchers here? <br />
**Zox:** We should have left more Voth on earth to prevent these nefarious hamsters from causing such calamity!<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The computer analysis revealed minimal access levels for other researchers. They may have had some knowledge, but no one but Anjek had access to the research database<br />
**Zox:** Someone had to know; it would not be possible for one individual to do all that.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** With any luck, Zox will have scared them straight<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Who supplied Anjek with the material? <br />
**Skig:** That is good to know. The grad students will not be forever tarnished and sent to the Peer Review Gauntlet of Death until they succumb to bitterness and old age, and decide to become university lecturers railing at the stupidity of youthful optimism.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** From the mission report, it sounds like he decked the lead scientist so hard her children will be feeling it<br />
**Skig:** I do not think her species procreates in that spot where Zox punched, so I doubt it will cause injury to her unborn.<br />
*Skig is also great fun at poker night.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The Kelorians declined our jurisdictional involvement, they are not a federation member so investigating the actions of the other researchers is ultimately up to them.<br />
**Zox:** That seems a little daffy. <br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Hmmmm. That's troublesome<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Zox sends her off to the Klingon Ritual of Innocence through Bloodshed.</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** What's going to happen to our new ion friends? <br />
**Dr. Zerra:** The captain sent the report to Starfleet, I would expect that they will dispatch a long-term research team to the planet<br />
**Zox:** Is there no way to ban research on this planet temporarily?<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Well the Kelorian's won't be able to coninue their research, but the xeno-anthropology team from Starfleet will want to learn more about these life-forms<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I don't think they'll be able to set anything meaningful up<br />
**Skig:** Presumably the Federation will open diplomatic relations with them, and through section 18B, sub paragraph 102, bullet points 4-9 inclusive, they would be protected from hostile experimentation per the "sentient non-organic clause" stipulated by the Organians.<br />
*Zox lights a cigar, and puts a briefcase on the table.*<br />
**Zox:** Okay, who wants to pay for this? I'm sure it's good.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** What's in it?<br />
**Zox:** I collect. I secure.<br />
**Zox:** I do not know what's in it.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** I don't think we should, if we benefit from their research on sentient life-forms against their will, are we any better than they are?<br />
**Zox:** I would only want to have this investigated such that we know how to live more amicably with them. Perhaps our ion-pulse engines give them headaches and we shouldn't even be here, for example<br />
**Skig:** I'm sure Commander Bachar will have some great ideas on how this can be used to further the Federation's interests.<br />
*Skig is fully expecting to be disintegrated by someone from Section-31 any second.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I think we should look into it, if only to ensure that Anjek was working alone<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** But overall, I'm with Doctor Zerra, if we want to study them then we should do so the right way<br />
**Skig:** There is a possibility that warp containment or ion-containment fields could be adapted to make them even more resilient and stable.<br />
**Skig:** Yes, hopefully Star Fleet is sending a long-term research team with a Tellerite or two to open diplomatic conversations.<br />
**Zox:** Well, we are all done with this for now and someone else will take this information. A toast for none of our brains becoming toast.<br />
**Skig:** Indeed.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** That is something I can drink to<br />
*Skig raises a glass.*<br />
**Skig:** And a chance to say "goodbye" to my old mentor one more time.<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): 'Data's Day' or whatever that episode was, is like the poster for character specific ep.</font><br />
