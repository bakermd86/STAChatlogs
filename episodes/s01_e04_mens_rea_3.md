**Security Officer:** Nobody move, you could be the shapeshifter for all I know<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it's just the one shapeshifter, though<br />
**Security Officer:** That is just what a second shapeshifter would say<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Or zero? Did you shoot her, Skig?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Shapeshifter went out the window, but sure, have us all stand here while the murderous Shapeshifter who disintegrated Dr. Malov gets away.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox with, "this is your field of expertise" expression of exasperation.*<br />
*Security Officer pulls out a hypospray*<br />
**Security Officer:** Alright, who's first for blood screens?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Will it make Hailey pregnant?<br />

*Dr. Zerra gives Zox some pain medicine and applies a burn spray*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Rawwwr. Barely a work up, you should see a Voth family reunion.<br />
*Skig goes full Klingon, takes off her glove, stabs herself in the hand with a knife and bleeds on the floor.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is how we did it during the Battle of Betazed.<br />
*Security Officer methodically performs a blood screen on all the staff, finding no shapeshifter goo*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I apologize about the biohazard<br />
**Security Officer:** Well, I guess you were right that none of you were shapeshifters<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait a second<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What if *YOU* are the shapeshifter?<br />
**Security Officer:** Good point, Dr. can you check me?<br />
*Dr. Zerra takes some of the Security Officer's blood and checks that it doesn't turn back into shapeshifter goo*<br />
*Zox Attempts to smell out the shapeshifter.*<br />
*Skig offers some of the Shapeshifter Goo on the window for comparison.*<br />

>Zox sniffs deeply but inhales far too many fire extinguishing chemicals, searing his lungs and causing him to caugh uncontrollably<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ooooh, don't do that<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Doctor Zera, is that healthy?<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): *Zerra</font><br />
*Zox makes some rather painful sounding, deep coughs.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Not at all, these industrial extinguishers utilize a lot of nasty compounds<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I imagine it would be excruciatingly painful<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It must be, Commander I will need to get in there surgically to repair the damage when we are back on the ship<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Until then, take this. <br />
*Dr. Zerra hands Zox a hypospray*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** If the pain gets too much, use this<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We could turn him into a cyborg by installing some robotic lungs and making him a Mecha-Zox.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That will be for the sequel<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Cybernetic enhancement is not without its benefits<br />
*Hailey Murry pulls away from the security guard to speak to Skig and Zox for a moment*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so we should discuss what to do with Commander Bachar's credentials. Do we want to disable them entirely or flag them? <br />
*Zox Attempts to recall what the Starfleet protocol is...*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Standard procedure would be to honeypot them into a useless location that would trap her account to log her location.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's not a terrible idea good Skig.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Interesting. Have a look at this: whoever that was immitating Commander Bachar fed a sample of changeling genetic material into the chemical printer<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We need to ascertain the likely next location they will strike and respond more quickly. Any indications of where they went? Also, a pair of Nausicans were with her originally and they beamed out immediately, so we need to follow their transporter trace also.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** ...or they were melted by the fire...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, let's check these for evidence that may help us figure out where they came from or where they are going.<br />
*Skig points to immolated Nausicans.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** This is unusual. Both Naussicans have signs of low level radiation poisoning<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Zerra, can you match the signature against all known changelings?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why would they need more changeling genetic material? Is it possible they're looking to make a mask or suit? <br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am not sure Counselor, this equipment couldn't possibly clone changling genetic material<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** They must have been using it for its chemical properties<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And Zox, I am afraid that whatever genetic material was present was consumed by the chemical printer<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did it get the chance to print anything?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The log indicates it printed approximately 800ml of something<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But the chemical signature was wiped<br />

*Skig gets out a large hammer for a small piece of electronics.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Don't hit the end with the power supply this time<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We may be able to reconstruct the chemical signature from the encoded memory files if the buffer was not cleared, which it might not have been if it was in the printing process when we interrupted them.<br />
*Skig is not multitasking well.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Zerra, what other labs would have a device like this capable of replicating changeling DNA? I surmise we should locate the next closest one, and we will find Bachar there.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let me see if I can work that through here<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Next time I think we should shoot first and ask questions later, per Starfleet protocol involving Changelings.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But we aren't technically at a state of war with them?<br />

*Skig blinks away a spray of battery chemicals from her face and mutters something about idiotically opening the face shield BEFORE finishing her checks.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Sorry, I missed that. Did you suggest not shooting Bachar on sight?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Err... I meant the suspected Changeling, yes. That is what I meant.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes, because if you shot the real Bachar, you'd never see life outside the brig again.<br />
*Zox shrugs.*<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Exentuating circumstances.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so they managed to wipe the logs first. However, there are no alerts for chemical weapons nor dangerous compounds<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Those logs are intact still<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** None are recent<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hey Skig, can you be 1337 HA}{OR and temporarily have all of this model of bio-printer instead make romulan ale rather than genetic code?<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That sounds like a great idea.<br />
**Security Officer:** Ma'am, here is the footage you requested!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Or, if you think you are up to it, only do this conditionally if anything matches a changeling genetic pattern<br />
**Security Officer:** hands Hailey Murry  a PADD<br />
*Security Officer hands Hailey Murry  a PADD*<br />
*Hailey Murry takes the PADD and looks it over*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you, sir. What was your name again? <br />
**Security Officer:** I'm sorry ma'am? I don't understand<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ah, nevermind<br />
*Skig writes a malware update signed with the Federation Security Certificate that causes all "White Printers" on the planet to generate the equivalent of "TURBO EX-LAX" whenever activated by anyone who tries to replicate the sample files we are investigating.*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is Anal Konis, so we can work from there to determine what our quarry's next steps would be. Well, as soon as I get this rewritten and uploaded to create an upstream source dependency and push out a GPO update across the planetwide network.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Antal, but you know, if the "name fits".</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** After feeding the voice signatures through an extensive database, I have determined that a wanted Orion Criminal by the name is Jasanis is in cahoots with this shapeshifter. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so whoever took Bachar's place knew what Dr Malov was researching beforehand. They definitely did the secret duplication of shapechanger goo, you can see her apply it here and one of her goons activate the machine behind the doctor's back. <br />
*Zox grabs a computer and does a pubmed search on Dr. Malov.*<br />

[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 22]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or Jasanis is the Shapeshifter or has been replaced by the Shapeshifter. But this gives us something to start with.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But what is so special about this lab that they would bother breaking in?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Just to use a chemical printer?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox, if we know we are looking for an Orion woman named Jasanis, would this be a good time to initiate a planetwide security scan to locate all Orion pheromone signatures?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What is the connection between Ketracel White and Changelings? <br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Delete that one lol</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Those are great questions, Dr. Zerra, if no one else has a suggestion I can review the manufacturing details to determine what makes this special.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Please.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So it looks like these printers aren't mechanically special, any printers can do the same things. However, these printers were being used to research production on Ketracel White, so anything specific to the Starfleet's research of the drug would need this specific machine<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's the software, not the hardware<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good thing I made a backup before I injected the TURBO-EXLAX Malware. Although, forcing all Gem-Hadar to suffer from extreme Taco Bell overingestion to the point of dehydration is not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Above sentence paid for by Taco Bell competitors</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That doesn't make any sense, why would a founder need to co-opt Federation research on Ketracel White? The Founders already produce the stuff, they invented it!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Perhaps to stop our research into it?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Simple sabotage?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Could be, they did kill Dr. Malov<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Right, I doubt this is being done in the spirit of cooperation with the Federation to liberate the Gem-Hadar from their dependency on the Founders.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But the intruder still left with 800ml of something from the printer. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes, that. What did they have to produce? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And we need to track that down if we can't find it.<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Fake Ketracel White to rile up the Gem-Hadar that the Federation is trying to kill them?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, how did they know about what was being researched here? It was top secret. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wish Neraran was here. This would be a puzzle she'd be most adept at piecing together.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed, no record of this research is evident at our clearance level<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr Malov's daughter needs to make fewer Kotkit posts from her father's lab.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Social Media, still used for stupid in the 2400s.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** The security team called me to notify me that my senior staff burned down a lab<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That looks delicious captain.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** It is, I've had several<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That is not entirely true, I was too busy shooting a shapeshifter in the back to set anything on fire.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Actually we didn't do the burning.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I see<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It was six nausicaans with one, gun, no wait, one nausican with six guns.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Commander Bachar has been kidnapped and replaced<br />
*Captain Baras does a spit take*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Group W bench, ---IN SPACE---</font><br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Why wasn't I informed?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** That my first officer was kidnapped and replaced with a shapeshifter?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Up until about 5 minutes ago we were firefighters.<br />
*Hailey Murry looks at Skig*<br />
*Captain Baras squints his eyes at Skig*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And before that we were hasily investigating a kidnapping<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** In the future, I should be informed of any kidnappings of senior staff<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We didn't know she was replaced with a shapeshifter until a few minutes ago<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And before that, Dr. Zerra was losing his entire shore-leave budget on one hand of cards. Ha!<br />
*Captain Baras takes a deep breath and drinks some of his drink*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Zox, do you have a plan to locate my missing officer?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** My apologies captain, I believed you were indisposed and was going to make a full report shortly.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Then go, find her<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I will cancel shore leave for the senior staff and file a report to Starfleet command. I can't imagine it will reflect well on our service record for the first officer to be kidnapped...<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Sir, I must present the trolley problem of the day, and that is a rogue shapeshifter in cahoots with the orion syndicate, doing illegal genetics and narcotics research, is of potentially higher impact.<br />
*Captain Baras does another spit take, right into Zox's face*<br />
*Zox takes no offense.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Thank you for cleaning my face.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, canceling the senior staff shore leave to address this problem is likely quite important.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** When this situation is resolved, I want you all to take some time to read the regulations regarding making regular reports up your chain of command<br />

*Captain Baras sighs*<br />
*Zox pulls out his 'little book of starfleet regulations'*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Alright, then go find this shapeshifter. Hopefully it leads you to Bachar<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I shall remember to notify you in the future as the needs warrant captain. This is a failure on my part and I accept full responsibility.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I will round up the senior staff and get them back to Lister. Hopefully we can get critical systems back online to assist from there<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Would you like to me work in engineering to assist that or continue here with the Counselor and Security Chief?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Yes, I'll need you Commander<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I shall be happy to assist and report accordingly.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Zox, you're in command here. Bring in whatever other personel you need and find that shapeshifter<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** If I lose my first officer, you're all getting demoted<br />
