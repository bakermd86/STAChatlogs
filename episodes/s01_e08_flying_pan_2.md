>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: The younger of the two alien men runs off into the darkness, while the older man remains kneeling in front of T'Kor. He puts away his knife now that "Nanon" has told him he doesn't need to sacrifice himself for his intrusion.<br />

**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Saset, run back to the village, tell Piney that Nanon has returned. The Keepers of the Flame have not forsaken us<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Our prayers have been answered at long last<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man turns back to T'Kor*<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Nanon, we never lost hope that you would return to lift the blight <br />
*Geret looks in awe and for orders from her new captain, Nanon.*<br />
**T'Kor:** Tell us more about the current situation. <br />
*Geret is dissapointed that a god uses such boring, pedestrian, and laconic words.*<br />
*Skig ticks off list of, "Yes sir, these are all the ways we violated the Prime Directive" checklist.*<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** We have remained faithful even in the face of the blight, Shaper Nanon. Myself and Saset are still free of blight, but most of the village is now blighted<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Pinek is better suited to speak to a Shaper though, I am just a hunter....<br />
*T'Kor adjusts his universal translator*<br />
**T'Kor ** *(for Star Fleet only)*: This blight sounds like an illness. It also sounds like another civilization has visited here before. It is unlikely, though possible, that it would be other Tholians, given how far away we are from my home system. Do we know of any previous explorations?<br />
*Skig suspects that this is a situation where Kolea would have been an ideal crew member on this trip.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There was no survey data in the astrometrics database, but until recently this system was in Cardassian space<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): Obviously Zox, Throk, and T'kor would have been ideal</font><br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): Imagine Ishemok here</font><br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It's only opened up to Starfleet exploration since they contracted their borders after the war<br />
*Dr. Zerra discreetly scans the man with his tricorder*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'm not reading any signs of infectious disease, but there is some minor cellular degeneration <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(for Starfleet only)*: Let us not jump to suppositions here concerning whether they have been recently visited by another spacefaring society. We need to be very cautious about our interactions.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Agreed, even if they have been visited by another warp civilization, the prime directive is still in effect<br />
**Geret: [ CONTROL  (10) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 21]**<br />
**T'Kor:** What should we do if there is some sort of higher technology that has been left here? Is it appropriate to remove it? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, find out when the "Keepers of the Flame" last visited and how they visited?<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously to the hunter)*: How long ago were you last visited?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Rule of Non-Interference would apply unless we can determine that the higher technology caused a disruption in their natural development. If the "Keepers of the Flame" introduced the blight that is endangering this society, removing it and letting them return to their normal, albeit now altered, evolution would be the appropriate course of action, from my understanding.<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** I am not sure, I am so sorry Shaper Nanon. Pinek would know when it last was. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** But then, I am 100% the last pick for any first contact situation, something about an Insight below 7...although, this would be our second first contact situation this season...<br />
**Geret:** Have you seen the radiation spike eminating from coordianates 12.34? Perhaps this blight is just exposure?<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks at Geret's readings*<br />
**Geret:** Distribute the iodine pills!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** See if they visited last when he was alive? Dr Zerra, can you get an estimate of how old he is?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Possibly, these levels are not extreme, but with longer term exposure they could cause this type of cellular damage<br />
**Geret:** Oooh! Can we put on spacey-suits and investigate it?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'd advise against using EVA suits, we are causing enough cultural contamination as-is. I don't think we should flaunt too much of our technology<br />
**T'Kor:** I do not think they visited while he was alive, or surely he would be able to provide an estimate such as "when I was a young lad"<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The space suits were in closet D, which is currently somewhere in that cluster of overhead flaming debris from where the port nacelle broke off during entry.<br />
*Skig points at series of red flaming streaks falling through the sky.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I think we should wait for this specialist of theirs<br />
*Skig hopes Zox didn't leave a Type-2 phaser in there, which is found by some primitive spacefaring people, who then use it to create a large Empire and slaughter millions.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would concur.<br />
**T'Kor:** I am already in radiation shielding, so I can explore closer to the location and provide the readings for you to analyze<br />
**Geret: [ INSIGHT  (9) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 16]**<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I don't think these levels of radiation are an immediate concern<br />
**T'Kor:** Would they have anything to do with whatever knocked us from the sky? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We didn't read any radiation during our descent, it may be related but I doubt it is causal <br />
**Geret:** With 89.9999782% confidence, I can say that it is a technology that far exceed what our new tribal friends could produce. <br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man stares at his feet and sweats profusely while the away team discusses in languages he cannot comprehend*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, can you coordinate with Subfunky third degree Geret on the location of the radiation to the angle of deployment from the field that knocked us out of orbit?<br />
*Skig looks at Middle-aged man.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ensign, when we get back to the Lister I'm going to send you a primer on accuracy vs. precision<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously to the hunter)*: You are forgiven<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Aye<br />
**Geret: [ INSIGHT  (9) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]
Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 13]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And Viraseti, can you make sure the Golden Retriever of Starfleet does not run off and get you eaten?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'll do my best ma'am<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): As long as you do not roll a 20 followed by a 14</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** If this "blight" is simple radiation exposure it should be easy to give treatment for the cellular damage, but the only long-term cure for radiation sickness is to remove the radiation<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, ask our new friend how long the Blight has been going on, when the last time the Seekers of Flame were here, and how old he is?<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: How old are you?<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** I have seen 41 summers, Nanon<br />
**Geret: [ INSIGHT  (9) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 11]**<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: And for how many summers has the blight been known?<br />
**Geret:** Nanon, that woud be equivalent to 49.27654 standard years.<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** The blight first befell us shortly before my son's birth. 11 summers hence.<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man continues looking intently at the ground and never raising his head.*<br />
**Geret:** or ~13 years ago<br />
**Geret:** Also Skig, the harmonics from the radiation source match the theta wave from the signal that hit your shuttle when everything started going crazy. There may be a connection. <br />
**T'Kor:** So a few years before the end of the war? <br />
*Geret continues playing with a tricorder and skillfully tapping buttons.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** A few years before the start of the war.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thank you Subfunky Third Degree<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Stupid translator. I meant, "Enisgn Geret"<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Wait, do you not know our names?<br />
*Skig checks "autocorrect" settings on translator.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Have you been using your translator to interpolate our names into your speech?<br />
*Skig looks at Viraseti.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Whatever are you getting at Psycho-Science-Woman?<br />
*Skig takes off translator and shakes it.*<br />
*Skig puts it back on.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes Commander Viraseti, I know your name.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** What about my first name?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Perhaps Commander Skig's lack of interpersonal development is something we should address at a later date?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's Lisa, right?<br />
*Skig really hoping it was not Bart, but she gets them confused when she watches that show.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Exactly, the Zox-Repair-Drone is right.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hold Please.<br />
*Skig takes communicator off.*<br />
*Skig gets out screwdriver.*<br />

*Skig puts communicator back on.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, so what were we discussing before the communicator went on the fritz?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We need to get off this planet as soon as possible, before we do any more damage to these people's development<br />
**Geret:** I think we are too late.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ensign Geret's readings of this radiation source seem like the best lead we have<br />
**Geret:** They have seen technology, of this I am sure. They just lack the proper vocabulary to describe it.<br />
**T'Kor:** Can we secure the shuttle against intrusion? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If someone else is interfering in their development, that is a pitty. But it doesn't give us the right to disregard the Prime Directive<br />
*Skig gets out nuclear-armed laser trip mines.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Wait, no, that would be bad.</font><br />
*Skig puts those back, does not want to pay the Escalation cost.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti is correct, we need to address this as quickly as possible.<br />
**T'Kor:** I meant Old Faithless, but I agree<br />
**Geret:** Does the Prime Directive cover civilizations that once had very near interstellar capability, but then fell apart?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We should discuss what we can with the village elder he mentioned and then head to the source of the radiation.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Aye<br />
*Dr. Zerra takes out his medkit*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will make sure the shuttle is secured and locked down as well as possible, given the damage, so if anyone comes along and pokes around, they will not get access to it. Also, we need to setup some annoyance fields like the one that is keeping the animals at bay to keep creatures away from our shuttlecraft.<br />
**T'Kor:** We should be careful of the elder, in case they are gifted with any unusual tongues<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Just to be safe, I'm going to give everyone a cellular enhancer. It should prevent any negative effects from the radiation for a while at least<br />
**Geret:** Why not get T'kor to tell them he is here to do battle with Sniffles, Bringer of Blight, and that they must safely evacuate in the direction opposite the radiation, and only come back in a week?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, can you see if it is possible to rig up that noise maker you invented to keep the animals away in a portable form so we don't have to fight our way through hordes of whatevers?<br />
**T'Kor:** It is my understanding that this would be interfering in their culture. Minimal contact is ideal<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Good thinking<br />

**Geret:** You puzzle me T'kor.<br />
**Geret:** Okay, you find a way to get them to hide while the technological adults meddle in their affairs.<br />
*Skig hands Geret a 2000 piece puzzle from one of the storage cabinets on Old Faithless to keep her occupied.*<br />
**T'Kor:** We should keep in mind that anything we tell them can and will be incorporated in future visits<br />
*Geret is distracted my colorful designs and no longer in weighty questions of morality.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** After speaking with their Eldar, we could tell them we are concerned that we may be spreading the Blight by our presence and they should stay away from the area. It is the truth as they would understand it.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Or Eldar, unless we have joined the 40k Universe.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Third times the charm - "ELDER"</font><br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (T'Kor): *dark eldar</font><br />
**Geret:** Ya know, if this was a forge-world....it would make sense.<br />
**Geret:** but readings weren't THAT strong.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Yeah, more likely an Agri-world, not enough debris for a Hive World.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): gets out Tricoder, sets to "Break Fifth Wall", checks for Tyranid spores.</font><br />
*Skig gets out Tricoder, sets to "Break Fifth Wall", checks for Tyranid spores.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree with Skig, on balance I think scaring them away in vague terms is safer than allowing them to observe us for an extended period.<br />
*Geret takes note of the crews general acceptance of white-lies for a later date.*<br />
**T'Kor:** Shall I send our hunter away? <br />
*Skig has a panic attack when she realizes that Throk is a SAURUS from Warhammer fighting against Space Orks.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Unless you want him to lead us to this elder<br />
**T'Kor:** I think the other two went to fetch their elder<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Elder is already coming, best to get the local hierarchy on our side with our minor deception.<br />
**Geret:** Can't we just leave a hologram to baffle these locals?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, Ensign Retriever, I was planning to do just that.<br />
*Skig takes off communicator and shakes it again.*<br />
**Skig: [ REASON  (10) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 13]**<br />
**T'Kor:** Should we expose them to holograms?<br />
**Geret:** I begin to think you have no native lore...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Your use of native is incorrect, as a Tholian, he would have considerable lore NATIVE to his species which is likely ALIEN to you.<br />
*T'Kor was pretty confused by that*<br />
**Geret:** I mean ...I guess so.<br />
>As Skig works on securing the shuttle, a tall older female of the same species as the hunters comes out of the bush accompanied by the younger hunter. She is thin, almost sickly so. And her face and hands are covered in lesions<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Unless you meant naive, which, well, no comment at this time.<br />
**Pinek:** Nanon, Shaper of the World's Fire, creator of heaven and earth, binder of life and death, I am priestess Pinek. Have you come to answer our prayers?<br />
*Skig makes sure the woman does not get near Old Faithless, who knows if what that creature has is contagious to HER shuttlecraft.*<br />
*Pinek kowtows in front of T'Kor*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zerra, please get as much data and readings as you can from her to see if the Blight in question is radiation caused or something else?<br />
**T'Kor:** Shall I have the others leave? <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Yes ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, this is fine for now.<br />
*Geret is so incredibly confused by silicon based life, as T'kor is deadpan and technical, and Kolea is pure emotion.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Find out what their prayers are, how long the Blight has been happening, when it started, etc.<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Which prayers do you come bearing?<br />
*Skig goes back to working on Old Faithless and only pays partial attention.*<br />
**Pinek:** Nanon, we pray for forgiveness for whatever trangression we committed to cause the blight. We have prayed daily for your guidance, your leadership, and your mercy.<br />
**Pinek:** I could not bring our offerings here, we have gathered them in your temple, but I was too weak to carry them<br />
**Pinek:** If you accompany me, I can show you that we have not been praying idly<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Then you may offer through your words in a test of wisdom instead. Which transgression brought upon the blight?<br />
*Pinek sobs*<br />
**Pinek:** We do not know Shaper Nanon! We have wondered for so long what we did to offend you.<br />
**Pinek:** The people look to me for guidance, but your ways are mysterious and beyond my understanding, Shaper<br />
*Pinek collapses to the ground, brought to tears by T'Kor's mocking question*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You're doing great ensign<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Turn your chin up, faithful one. What happened toward the start of the Blight?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Umm...we should find out if she has seen other Shapers and if they looked like Nanon, how long ago, and so on. In some sort of eloquent way that does not make the woman cry?<br />

**Pinek:** The blight started in the temple, the first shaper was the first to die<br />
*Skig wonders what it is about Tholians that they seem to be obsessed with Faithless and Faithful things. She adds, "read-up on Tholian culture" to her weekend activities list.*<br />
**Pinek:** The blight started in the temple, the first speaker was the first to die<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Find out where the Temple is, if it is in the direction of the radiation source we might be on to something...<br />
**Pinek:** I was only Fifth Speaker then, but so many in the temple have perished<br />
*Skig notes that "promotion through attrition" works in this society, just like in Starfleet.*<br />
**Pinek:** That is how we knew it had to be our fault, we speak with the voice of the Keepers, and we were being struck down. The people kept looking to us for answers, but our prayers did nothing<br />
**T'Kor:** Are we permitted to provide any aid as thanks for them aiding us in looking into the matter? <br />
**Geret:** All signs point to them worshiping a leaky, glowing bit of reactor core that looks like you. <br />
*Geret winks at T'Kor *<br />
**Geret:** hot stuff.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Don't make sexual gestures towards T'Kor in front of these people<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You don't want your weird fetish to forever alter their religious beliefs<br />
*Skig looks up from what she was working on.*<br />
**Geret:** But but....awww.<br />
**T'Kor:** Dr Zerra, would we be able to arrange for any treatment for them, if it looks like this is higher technology at work? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ensign Subflunky Golden Retriever, you will NOT be attempting to mate with the the longest living engineer in my department to satisfy some strange urge. Also, it would be fatal for you.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I will need some tissue samples to analyze, but if this is radiation damage it should be reperable<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You can't administer medical care to these people. I know you mean well, but you can't interfere in their development. Even if it means their death<br />
*Geret looks deflated and determines the puzzle is more fun than this situation*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, can you ask the nice Speaker if your servant can check her Blight more thoroughly?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Don't worry, I Can give you a salve that should make it safer<br />
**T'Kor:** I would think that allowing their development to cease entirely would be a greater interference, would it not?<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We need to know what the damage is, Viraseti. If it is radiation poisoning we can account for that, if it is some other biological contaminant we need to know what it is to protect ourselves from it.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree with you ma'am, but whatever we find we can't go around taking tissue samples and curing these people's radiation sickness<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** "These people" didn't give themselves radiation sickness, it was clearly done to them. We can't just comdemn them to die slowly from cellular damage<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We can fix the issue and prevent it from getting worse to start with.<br />
**Geret:** I'd like to think sentient beings deserve better than being trapped in a radioactive petri-dish for some esoteric philosopher. Boo Prime directive.<br />
**T'Kor:** Let us revisit the conversation later. Can we secure our shuttle while we are gone? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Already done<br />
**T'Kor:** Do we travel together, or split up? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We should stick together, limit the chance of unintended contamination<br />
**Geret:** Why would you not take your faithful retinue, oh venerable Nanon, bringer of shapes, flamer of power.<br />
*Geret 's grin looks a little...titled.*<br />
*Geret *tilted.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I was thinking we have two locations to investigate; the temple and the source of the radiation. Or maybe it's secretly one location? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Only one way to find out<br />
**Geret:** It's almost surely one location now<br />
**T'Kor ** *(Imperiously)*: Offer a prayer in the direction of the temple and your offerings, and we shall begin.<br />
**Pinek:** Of course Shaper, it would be my honor to show you the offerings we have gathered<br />
*Pinek begins walking into the woods along with the two hunters, while muttering a prayer under her breath*<br />
>The away team is led into a primitive humanoid village. The residents live in simple stone and wood dwellings, most only a single story. The village is centered around a much larger, more imposing stone structure with a spire approximately 12 meters tall above a large stone structure with ornate stylings. No doubt the temple in question.<br />

>In front of it, there is a public square where the away team finds a statue that suspiciously resembles T'Kor. On closer inspection though, the statue is clearly not Tholian, although it is a six-limbed insect of some kind. It's body segmentation is different, and it has different limb articulation. But the presentation of the form wreathed in flame, glowing hot orange, does lend it a bit of a resemblance.<br />

**Geret:** make some small talk, I have a plan<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I thought the plan was to get rid of them so we stop contaminating their culture with our presence?<br />
**Geret:** Well, Commander, we are closer to the poison now than ever. Just need to weasel it out a little bit and they should be free of this blight<br />

**T'Kor:** She was clearly unfit to walk down the stairs, I suspect she is not currently fit to walk up the stairs right now<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Her cellular damage is extreme<br />
**T'Kor:** Is this definitely radiation poisoning?<br />

**Geret:** A ha! There we go. I have ferreted it out. There is infact a transporter device immediately below this room!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** No sign of toxins or radioactive contamination in these offerings, so at least whatever is causing their blight hasn't contaminated their food sources<br />
