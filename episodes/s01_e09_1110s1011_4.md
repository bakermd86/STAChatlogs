**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Human holo-deck writers still use the baroque conventions established in the early 21st century when designing games. Surely, the white key...I mean white keycard, will get us the treasure.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Me thinks too many of these convetions draw from something stuck in human psychology, always looking for that item in the maze....<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** We just need a few good distractions and this caper wraps itself up.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I expect that it is some sort of keycard, but the question is what for and whether there are external passwords to analyze<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** No, no it really doesn't. Then we get to play the game unscripted after we get this quantum data...<br />
>INTERIOR - Skig's Machine Shop: The crew meet back in the machine shop to plan their next move. Malat is the last to arrive on her bike, with Ishemok on the rear seat bleeding profusely from an open chest wound.<br />

*Sam Mulloy Also I am busy writhing on the floor and not in this scene.*<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) saunters in, looking very satisfied and relaxed.*<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** This is the BEST holodeck experience I have had in a while.<br />
*Lt. Malat dumps Sam Mulloy onto a couch*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It looks like the safety protocols don't register Ishemok as a person<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** He took that birdshot like a champ though<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Murry's damsel in distress turned out not to need saving.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** How can Earth gangsters survive if they aren't savy enough to understand their car's extended warranty?<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** FYI - Guiseppe Garbo told me that he, Fredo, pit boss Casimiro, and the family lawyer have access to the vault. It's a white security card. The vault can only be opened between 0845 and 2215. Also, he can not hold his liquor or his women.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Tracy, your planet is goofy.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Fantastic! <br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** FYI - Guiseppe Garbo told me that he, Fredo, pit boss Casimiro, and the family lawyer have access to the vault. The vault can only be opened at exactly 0845 and 2215. Also, he can not hold his liquor or his women, and will run his tongue off like no tomorrow when he gets really excited. He is probably bad at poker.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I mean, he's pretty bad at poke her also.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** So we double work him? someone cozyies up to him and makes him real comfortable while a few of us intentionally lose at whatever table we lure him to?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk feeling uncomfortably warm in this room suddenly. Also, Kolea's first comment included out of character information that should be removed from record. Only Throk allowed to break fourth wall like that.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Ignatius Constantine (Throk)): Had to step away for a bit, back now.</font><br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Meanwhile, the stealthiest, most commando like team gets to the vault and extracts our precious quantum data....which is from a real gang, but guarded by a fake gang in this reality...<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Do we have to lose? I think we might be able to keep his attention pretty well if we simply make it close<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** The closer the better.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I can only distract him for about 5 minutes, he doesn't have stamina beyond that.<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) inserts fingers in earholes and begins going, "LALALALALALALA"*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Hrm, the gift shoppe had silly putty, but we need to find some serious putty to get into the vault. Anyone know where to source that?<br />
*Pennington (T'kor) does not have earholes to plug, and suffers in silence*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** The card will only bypass the elevator<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should go over everything again quickly. 11, 10 can you give us a quick briefing?<br />
*Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio thanks the twins*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Thanks to Commander Zox... Apologies: Thanks to Guido, his new employment at the casino restaurant has given him access to the areas shaded in green. And by accessing them, it has allowed us to more accurately detect their contents with a greater level of detail. "Bubbles" has also obtained a form of employment which cannot be described in detail on this network at this timeslot, additional deleted scenes may be available on the unrated collectors' edition BluRay. Suffice to say that she now has access to the "social club" beneath the casino (9).<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** While neither area grants direct access to any critical areas, the social club shares a common internal wall with the vault (12) and generator (11) areas. Although that wall is quite substantial: more than 30cm thick.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Guido's position also gives him access to an employee lounge (3) adjacent to the floor security office (4). While the kitchen (5) has a small, primitive form of turbolift (C) known as a "dumbwaiter" connecting it to the social club.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Both the kitchen and the loading dock (6) where Bubbles enters the building for "work" share a common wall with the count room (7).<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Thank you Commanders. Team, we are running out of time, so we need to get our plan buttoned up and run this op before we get to our rendezvous with the fleet<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Zox, you're the security chief. What are your thoughts on accessing the vault?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Skig, is our drill operational?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Surely your engineering beats pre-WWIII human tech?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is, this should tear through the locking mechanism in 6.78 seconds.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** If we create a scene at a card table, and have a low level crime wave of just people that need to be escorted out for disorderly conduct, we should have the place suitable distracted to get the vault to ourselves<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Will it do so loudly? <br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Even if it's loud, I doubt a game or primitive humans can deal with so many things at once.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Per Throk's request, it will make a roar like a Brachiasaurus in Heat tearing through all the paper doors and wooden buildings in 1950s Tokyo Monster Movies.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It was specific enough that I was shocked he would ask for such a thing, so I set it up that way.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** don't talk about my mother that way!<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk pay homage to great and wonderful Ruhk lady at every opportunity.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** How did you pull that name out of thin air? I don't even remember you being in the series then.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What about an escape plan? If we're creating chaos in the casino up top, the floor will be swarming with security and cops by the time you are leaving the vault<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk was stunt double for snake monster.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You plan to just walk out carrying bags of loot?<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) blinks a couple times.*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Do we know what form the loot will take? <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.: [ REASON  (8) +  SCIENCE  (5)]
[Focus: Acoustics ]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Is escape actually required by the game??<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is unclear, however we can determine from memory scanning that the vault contains approximately 2,350kg of simulated mass<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Almost certainly, we don't want a suicide approach to just blitz in and take it<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So whatever form it will take, we can safely assume it will be heavy<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 turn to Guido*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The data may or may not be in a form that is readily readable<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Hrm. That complicates matters<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** And we basically have to access it during operating hours, correct?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The Casino is open 24 hours per day<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Days on this planet are 24 hours in length<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Hmmmm<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** If we want to use their programmed access, it can only be opened at two specific times.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Shouldn't it be busier at night?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** SO more potential for distractions?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Agreed, the casino is busier at 20:00 hours than 09:00<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Who are the Garbo Family's enemies? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** There are numerous other familys who own and operate casinos on the strip<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** And the Nevada Gaming Board is seen as an enemy by all of these casino operators<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Do they do inspections? <br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 close their eyes for a moment*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** According to gaming regulations available in program memory, the Nevada Gaming Board does perform random inspections of gaming equipment<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Oh goody!<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Ah, but not the vault nor security operations? <br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I was asked to incapacitate one of the inspectors for "bribery" reasons. Unlike Guiseppe the inspector had 32 minutes of stamina and said he was used to these forms of bribery, because it is common throughout Las Vegas.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Correct<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: to Murry</font><br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk kindly ask Commander Bachar to not encourage Kolea to have this much fun in holodeck while children might ever see re-runs.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Hmmm<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: It's BluRay extras</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So we could have a new inspector come into town<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** To perform an inspection and refuse the bribe, someone incredibly stern and resistant. <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** They'd have to have a lot of technical knowledge and be uninterested in seduction entirely. <br />
*Lt. Malat turns to T'Kor*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Sounds like the kitchen needs an unquenchable grease fire right after the inspector<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** I could go. I'd need to get some of the operating manuals and a solid understanding on what to review<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** You don't need to actually inspect the slot machines<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** We know from Kolea's experience that they are going to bring you to the social club to try to stop the inspection<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Okay - So after a grease fire breaks out, and it's uncontrollable and incredibly smokey, we all have these masks to both let us see, breathe, and look like we are part of the response crew.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** So you would end up together with Kolea in the social club<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Good thinking<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Few are going to want to brave a fire.<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Will the system intentionally disable me during smoke? I do not have to breathe in the same way<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** I suspect you will be unaffected<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We suspect you will be unaffected<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** No, but you might have to worry about the sprinkler.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** His environment suit should be able to handle some water, as long as it is not damaged<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Ok, so Kolea and T'Kor can get into the social club, Zox can join them after he does his arson<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** What are they doing there?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I can give you an overview of the slot machines and tell you where I rigged them up to cheat in the casino's favor, that would allow you to look very credible in calling them out.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Do we have a plan for them to access the vault from there?<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Pennington (T'kor)): If only Oakadan were here, with his knowledge of fire safety </font><br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Or are they part of the escape plan to get out from the vault?<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Is there anything combustable that may explode? <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Counterpoint. Once the fire starts, will they send anyone directly to the vault to evacuate anything?<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Nawh, gotta be a fire-proof vault<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** The vault is on a time lock, they couldn't empty it if they wanted<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So presumably they trust it will be safe during any fire<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) looks at T'Kor.*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Okay, another question. What if the data is stored in a flammable form? <br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Look, I need you to just follow along with their, "please come down here to inspect the machines in the basement first" plan.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Then we need flame resistant bags, shouldn't be too hard to source, even in this time<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** We'll be in and out long before the fire has time to spread to the vault, we just need to make sure we don't lose anything on the way out<br />
*Skig was equally confused like T'Kor, but then, Skig takes everything literally and completely misses all concepts of innuendo and obfuscation.*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Well. It seems we have a plan<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** So I believe we head downstairs, when people start evacuating we'll bust through the wall and get access to the vault<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** We can then begin to drill through the vault, get access to it, grab the stuff, and make it out again<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So we start off with infiltration. Guido, Bubbles, and Pennington sneak into the buildilng. Skig prepares herself with the getaway vehicle and Malat prepares her biker buddies to make a run on the Count room. <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Ishemok takes a nap<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** In the hospital<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Who on earth thought it was a good idea to give guns to feeeeemales<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. shoots Sam in the kneecap with her one bullet*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** I can't have a body that doesn't end up ruined quite quickly....<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** I mean obviously, I need injuries to keep Zera guessing, so the stranger they are, the better!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** When we previously cheated at blackjack with Mr. Mulloy, we were brought to a room inside the secure cordon of the basement<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We could simply cheat at blackjack again to be brought down the elevator into the basement<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** That sounds extremely dangerous, I think Throk and I should come with you<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk not want little squishies killed in holodesk, Throk agree with wise and not-likely-to-be-set-on-fire-in-dumb-waiter woman.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Ok, I think we have a plan then:<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) makes popcorn.*<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) restocks prophylatics.*<br />
*Skig attempts to pay attention.*<br />
*Sam Mulloy reads the kitchen saftey manuals 'do not do this' section.*<br />
*Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio reads the kitchen saftey manuals 'do not do this' section.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** The twins will start off counting cards until we get taken down to be assaulted by casino staff, while Murry and Skig come around near the loading dock in Skig's truck.<br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** We take out the goons trying to torture the Gorn <br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Oh, right. Yeah, that might not be the best. Sorry, sometimes I forget basic medical knowledge when I get too excited.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk will recite Gorn Poetry.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** T'Kor blasts through the wall of the social club, Skig drills the vault, then we get out<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No Throk, they will be torturing you, not the other way around.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Everyone clear on the plan?<br />

>EXTERIOR - An old school bus parked in a field: Sam, Pennington and Throk pull up next to a rundown old school bus, with plywood sheets covering all the windows and junk piled up all around it. Near the bus is a strange looking hatch in the ground, with a rusty metal wheel on top of it locked with a bicycle chain<br />

**Sam Mulloy:** This is a junk yard, great for cover for carrying...extra special goods.<br />
*Sam Mulloy knocks on the hatch.*<br />
