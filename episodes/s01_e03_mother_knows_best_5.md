>INTERIOR - Crew Quarters, Deck 8: Rhuk is writhing on the ground, crying out in pain. Murry doubles over clutching her abdomen, but stays on her feet. Viraseti looks concerned as she scans them with her Tricorder<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The eggs… I’m not sure how to say this, but they appear to be hatching<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have a plan!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Does it involve a C-section with a high focus laser?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh no, I think I've seen this movie<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes! but with alternate means!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox, I will leave you do deal with this situation while I resume the plan to use the shuttle transporter to detox the ship.<br />
*Skig heads back the way she was going.*<br />

**Neraran:** Meh.<br />
**Neraran:** I have the death sentence on 12 systems.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If you want your crimes against Starfleet in particular, or sentient life in general, follow me!<br />
**Neraran:** Fortunately, none of them are members of the Federation, so no one has noticed yet.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Today is the day you use your talents for Starfleet!<br />
**Neraran:** Umm... really?<br />
*Neraran madly cackles.*<br />
**Neraran:** YES!<br />
**Neraran:** Let's do this.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Whatever you say sir, if you can just convince Lt. Hester not to press charges for stunning him with that phaser<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I know a Jefferies tube that will lead us around the breach. Follow me!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** All charges will be dropped if this works, if it doesn't, you won't have to worry!<br />
**Neraran:** I thought it was a spectacular amount of pistol whipping myself.<br />
**Neraran:** I especially like how his face repeatedly smashed into your boot like that while you held it still.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Lead the way sir<br />
**Laak:** Sounds like a plan to me!<br />
>Zox leads his possee into the Jeffries tubes and then through a service hatch into a narrow power conduit. It is only wide enough for them to go in single file<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Look for any rebreather apparatus on the way, it may come in handy.<br />

**Neraran:** Hmm, this higher temperature will excite chemical reactions and allow for a wider dispersal pattern and more rapid action of the reagents.<br />
**Neraran:** This should rupture aveoli in lungs quite well, causing bloody asphyixation. Pretty much the same as what Kodos the Executioner did before he went into hiding running a Shakespearan acting troupe for decades.<br />
*Zox begins to be concerned abbout Neraran*<br />
*Skig is really impressed at Neraran's knowledge of Star Trek genocidal tyrants from the original series.*<br />
*Laak comes out with a whole golf bag, complete with a number of golf clubs, and a bag of bocce balls*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, those golf balls make for great weapons delivery systems. Also, you can fill them with explosive goo and it is hilarious when they hit them with those stupid metal rods.<br />
**Neraran:** Oh, those golf balls make for great weapons delivery systems. Also, you can fill them with explosive goo and it is hilarious when they hit them with those stupid metal rods.<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Neraran): (Skig DID not say that)</font><br />
**Laak:** Oooh, you should show me how to set that up<br />
**Neraran:** No problem, if we live through this I'll be happy to show you how to use those properly.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Commander, are you sure it was wise to let these two out of the brig?<br />

**Laak:** Sounds like she's a cow--oh wow, he took that apart faster than Sath Meridian could<br />
**Laak:** Impressive<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay Team - Yes, we are all needed as a team here to clean up this mess. And also, in the spirit of Valentine's day somewhere in the universe, you are all now 'Hot'.<br />
**Neraran:** I'm only here because I have incredible respect for Zox's ability to masterfully hack through electronic things. Plus, I have heard that Voth like to vivisect their prey.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I had to disable the EPS conduits because of their exceptional power draw and consequent radiation.<br />
>Zox rips open a control panel and overloads the EPS manifold for the holodeck, forcing it to draw its power from the backup EPS conduit beneath the holodeck. <br />

*Laak holds his hands up in defeat*<br />
**Neraran:** Think about what?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Don't make me put more entries in your permanent record!<br />
**Laak:** Okay, okay, jeez<br />
**Neraran:** What are we thinking about?<br />
**Laak:** I dunno, Neraran, I wasn't thinking of anything<br />
**Laak:** Also, what do you mean by "parasited"?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's a good question. You'll see it in the brief<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But we still have to cleanse holodeck<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If we can disable the holodeck safety and run the right program, we stand a chance at solving some of the parasite issues.<br />

>Zox overrides the holodeck and conjures up a world-war 1 battlefield full of chlorine gas<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm not reading any lifesigns beneath us<br />
*Lt. Malat checks her tricorder*<br />
**Laak:** Does that include the other crew?<br />
**Neraran:** Well, I think we should consider the use of metaflourine hydraloxide combined with silicon dioxide.<br />
**Neraran:** Chlorine is so primitive.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But that's super odd, why would chlorine gas kill these things?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** They breath Flourine <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But that would involve teaching the holodeck to make banned compounds, strictly against regulations.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh. <br />
**Laak:** Uh, if they breathe flourine why would they be alive on the decks?<br />
**Laak:** Were they holding their breath? <br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 7]**<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But the form we encountered on the planet was a different life cycle.<br />
**Neraran:** That's why we need to oversaturate them with metaflourine, much like humans die if they are exposed only to pure oxygen.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That could be<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Either way, I'm not reading any lifesigns in the holodeck<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So maybe it worked<br />
**Neraran:** Hmm...<br />
**Neraran:** You are holding that upside down.<br />
*Zox Zox Smashes through an emergency hatch and appears in the square middle of the holodeck, ready to do battle with the SnekVoth Legions.*<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have at least a few moments before they announce the charge.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, this doesn't bode well.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Anyone know any music to shatter these, or chemicals to use here?<br />
**Neraran:** Yes, yes I do!<br />
**Laak:** Shatter, no, but...<br />
>Elsewhere, in a Jeffries tube near deck 36, Skig, Viraseti, Murry and Rhuk are descending towards the shuttlebay when they hear a screeching sound from several decks above them in the jeffries tubes<br />

>Skig looks up and sees a swarm of Voth-Sneks descending the Jeffries tube several decks above them<br />

<font color="##005500">Masakari (Rhuk): clearly I have the solution to this, as the episode is called mother knows best.</font><br />
