**Kolea:  [d6 = 5]**<br />
*Zox runs to the nearest control panel and begins to furiously tap on the colorful buttons in seemingly random patterns.*<br />
*Kolea grits her teeth and blinks through an incredible level of excruciating pain.*<br />

**Kolea:** Dr. Zerra, do, you by any chance, happen to have about 50cc woth of a pain killer I can stab myself with?<br />
**Zox:  [d20 = 12]**<br />
**Computer Voice:** Good thinking Commander<br />
**Computer Voice:** Redirecting the Nerouzine into the deck 6 ventilation system was a reasonable solution<br />
*Kolea takes a hypospray from her medical kit and stabs it into her shoulder joint to numb the pain from the fact that her left arm is currently angled upwards at 35 degree angle from about halfway down from the shoulder.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Don't we still have unconscious survivors from the other ship on Deck 6? <br />

**Kolea:** Hmm...that was..actually orange kool-aid. Dammit.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** At least it wasn't cherry<br />
*Kolea falls on her face when he realizes her left foot is bent at ninety degrees from the ankle.*<br />
**Computer Voice:** We elected to leave the gas situation to you while we worked on locking out the Captain's command codes<br />
*Hailey Murry offers Kolea a glass flask of wine as good ol' fashioned pain killer*<br />
**Kolea:** It's okay, it's normal for this to happen.<br />
*Zox looks concerned, even for a cold blooded reptile.*<br />
*Dr. Zerra gives Kolea a painkiller to at least allow her to function*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We'll need to get you in for surgery once Sickbay isn't flooded with gas anymore<br />
**Kolea:** Everything is fine! I'm not at all completely space-whacked-happy by having conflicting levels of pain and painkiller shorting out most of my neurons.<br />
**Kolea:** Doctor, we should totally try this combination on Ensign Killian when she goes into labor.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Does the computer seem unusually chatty to anyone else?<br />
**Kolea:** Nope, it's all good here.<br />
*Kolea gets some lipstick out and draws a smiley face on the computer console.*<br />
**Kolea:** See, it's even a happy computer!<br />
*Hailey Murry investigates the computer to see what's up with it*<br />

**Computer Voice:** Oh yes, please stand by while we reconfigure the voice synthesizer<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm...So if the Captain is having a nap, that means Skig is responsible for this ship, aye?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In the Name of the Twelve Tribes, is she using that damn lipstick that forms a permanent chemical stain on transparent aluminum? I still haven't figured out how to fix the officer's lounge on Deck 7.<br />
**Kolea:** Hush you, you aren't even in this scene.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (From Computer):** After we completed reprogramming the computer on the Taganite freighter, we found that our bodies were unconcious in sickbay<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We elected to remain in the computer for now instead<br />
**Kolea:** Hello twins!<br />
**Kolea:** I have absolutely no idea who posed you into spooning each other. It was definitely not Zox.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that's a relief<br />
**Kolea:** I know, who would have expected Zox to engage in perverse activities with members of command crew?<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, other than the human he fornicates with.<br />
*Kolea glares at Murry.*<br />
>A nearby door swishes open and Skig, Bachar and their away team walks through teh door following their tricorder signal<br />

*Zox doesn't seem to mind Kolea generating 4/10 fanfiction leads.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Murry, have you blown up any sections of the ship that I should know about in advance?<br />
**Kolea:** Hewwoo Skiggly-wiggly!<br />
>with her eyese glued to her tricorder, Malat walks slowly past Kolea and Zox until her tricoder is pressing into Murry's forhead<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm going to pretend that line NEVER existed.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Looks like one of the ends is here, 4 centimeters away<br />
*Lt. Malat looks up and notices Counselor Murry*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We could try cranial extraction?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't know what that excrutiating pain was a while back, but no that was not me. Someone else broke something that time<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox ** *(whispers)*: Dr. Zerra, I suggest a stronger anasthetic, if this keeps up none of us will have any secrets left!<br />
**Kolea:** Skiggly-wiggly, I don't think that's a good idea!<br />
*Kolea giggles.*<br />
*Kolea giggles.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'd like to politely request no cranial extractions yet<br />
*Hailey Murry puts her hand on the tricorder and lowers it from her head*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know, it sounds adventurous<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What's going on? <br />
*Zox looks to Skig.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There's a cosmic string stuck in your brain!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Isn't that incredible!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We were tracking the ends of the subspace string that is wrapped around the ship and causing mental instability in most of the inhabitants of the ship and likely led to the neural incapacitance of the entire Taganite crew.<br />
**Kolea:** Don't forget you were also on your way to the bake sale the enlisted were holding on deck 14.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wha-? How's it stuck in my brain? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That is a good question.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That I can't say, some exploratory brain surgery might give us a better idea<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, perhaps you could help Dr Zerra get that ready?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we do some less exploratory brain scans instead? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This doesn't seem proper.<br />
*Skig looks at Dr Zerra behind Viraseti's back and makes the, "please stab with knock out drug" hand sign.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Sickbay is still flooded with neurozine gas, I can't do any brain surgery or brain scans from a jeffries tube<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though we may have to wait, Zox flooded deck 6 with Nerouzine<br />
**Kolea:** Nonsense, taking out the brain for examination before surgery was quite common in some cultures.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't see how this works unless you have a subspace scalpel.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well doctor, might I suggest we use the secondary medical facilities on deck 8?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** They are not as well equipped, but should be servicable as the Lister's Advanced Sickbay facilities are spread through several decks.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We can take turboshaft 7 down to exit 4, then cross corridor 14 to encounter the least number of obstacles and the shortest path.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we're going to do any sort of medical things on my brain, we'll need someone to keep the Captain busy<br />
**Kolea:** I can give him a sensuous massage.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Someone skilled in espionage<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I should probably deal with him. If anyone is going to be charged with mutiny it may as well be the XO<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, this sounds like people trying to do some engineeering. Maybe instead of cutting open 5 skulls, we can patch one subspace string?<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 24]**<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Malat, you're with me. Noe one is going to notice one more line in your criminal record<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Zerra, Skig: try not to lobotomize Murry while we're gone<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...do you have any indication the subspace string is broken or frayed in a way that is causing this issue?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No, but Im sure someone has been running some good scans on this ship, it is our crew after all...<br />
*Kolea laughs when she realizes Bachar did not prohibit her from removing Murry's brain.*<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ REASON  (9) +  SCIENCE  (5)]

Success with 0 momentum [d20 = 2]**<br />
*Hailey Murry looks over Virasetti's shoulder, pointing at readings*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Based on Ishemok's scans, it looks to me like the coiling of string has created both a subspace capacitance and inductance which are causing the string to draw neural patterns from both ends. Like a coil of wire acting as an electrical transformer and capacitor at high frequencies<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah good! There's some actionable data!<br />
**Ishemok:** Well, let's see if you are as good at stealing information as you are the crew's heirlooms!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Are you sure we can't do just a little bit of exploratory surgery? I am REALLY fascinated to see what is going on in Murry's brain where this is stuck<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, let's see if you are as good at stealing information as you are the crew's heirlooms!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let's get the scans down with non-invasive surgery, please<br />
**Ishemok:** I'll talk! All the scans and info on the anomaly are on my tricorder! Take them, Grand Engineer Skig, and use your mighty brain to save us!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'd rather not have people cutting my head open while people are going mad<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'll add you to the author list on the paper I write if you let me just take a quick look<br />
*Ishemok begins pondering how he can pioneer a subscription based model to the federation's publication model.*<br />
**Kolea:** I think the best option here is some supervised exploratory surgery by a medical professional who is of sound mind and hot body. Therefore, for the sake of the crew, as a medical professional I feel that it is in your best interest, Counselor Murry, as someone who is responsible for the mental health of the crew, to allow us to inspect your mind.<br />

**Ishemok:** Viraseti, do people....pay for these...papers?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Nurse Kolea, as your superior medical professional I think you should probably lie down and rest given the severity of your injuries and the ammount of painkillers you are on<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you, Dr Zerra. Does it say a lot that I can't tell if she's being affected by the subspace string or if this is just normal? <br />
**Ishemok:** Rule 123: A great mind makes for great profits<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Federation journals are all open access, I'm afraid there isn't any profit in them<br />
**Kolea:** Give me a couple minutes to reconfigure the medical scanners with Ishemok's calculations to best determine how to track the cosmic string and find its anchoring points and see why it is attached to Murry.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Give me a couple minutes to reconfigure the medical scanners with Ishemok's calculations to best determine how to track the cosmic string and find its anchoring points and see why it is attached to Murry.<br />

*Kolea giggles and crawls onto a med bed.*<br />
**Kolea:** Everything is fine, we're all fine here. Everything is awesome.<br />
*Kolea begins making finger puppet shadows on the wall and laughing.*<br />
*Kolea looks at Murry.*<br />
*Ishemok has lost all respect for the Orion Syndicate as career criminals.*<br />
*Hailey Murry slowly slides the curtain closed between herself and Kolea to block the line of sight*<br />
**Kolea:** Nighty-night.<br />
*Zox No longer fears the Orion Syndicate.*<br />
**Kolea:** Good luck Skiggly-wiggly!<br />
*Kolea begins snoring.*<br />
*Kolea escaped from the Orion Syndicate, and in her current state, is probably not a good indicator of whether they are dangerous or cuddly individuals.*<br />

*Skig rewires everything with the readings from Ishemok and the tricoder to pinpoint and isolate the cosmic string information for evaluation.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are monitoring communications and internal scans, the Captain has dispatched another security team to this location<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Zox, would you like to intercept? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are attempting to delay them from here, but you should be prepared <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** With Pleasure!<br />
*Zox puts on a wrestling mask and takes a position above the door to the room.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I can only go 5 rounds.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well before Zox fills up all my beds with himself and his subordinates... Counselor let's get you into the scanner and see what's going on in that brain of yours, shall we?<br />
**Kurij:** Mind if I accompany you, Chief Luchador? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Tag Team! I Love it!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's okay, I have piped Captain Baras' voice through a modulator which should allow the Lt Cmdrs to constantly relay conflicting orders through the intercomes.<br />

*Dr. Zerra pulls up an image on the monitor as he scans Murry's brain*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The string seems to lead right to this spot here in your prefrontal cortex. It looks like the spot is surrounded by a small collection of scar tissue<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is extremely small, less than 12 micros<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: microns*</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But the scar tissue looks old, at least 5-10 years <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** So however it got stuck there, it seems to have been there for a long time<br />
*Zox Turns to Hailey*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Did you have an unregistered subspace parasite on this ship?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Those things need documents ya know?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Is it possible there is a comparable injury on her former crewmate which holds the other end of the cosmic string?<br />
**Kurij:** Hold on, what is *it*? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And the proximity of the two of them is what has brought on this situation?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How on earth would that have happened? <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That is possible, we could have easily missed something this small when we examined her<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Who is this person?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Wait that doesn't make sense, unless they were on the freighter?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** According to Murry, the other Federation officer is a member of a group of mutineers.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** According to the Captain, so are we<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Federation officer who was recovered from the brig of the Taganite freighter.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I can't think of anything that could have happened during the mutinee to have triggered something like this<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we just stick her on a shuttle and send her off and away? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't worry Dr. you have been held against your will the entire time on threat of being eaten by Zox and as a result are blameless in this situation.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well surely whatever caused it would have happened before the mutiny Counselor<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I surmise that would merely stretch the cosmic string out and create a tympanic response when it reached its limit before snapping back in an uncontrolled direction that might damage my beautiful Lister.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, would you agree with my hypothesis on the result of separating the two of them?<br />
**Ishemok:** Wait, everyone caught between Murray and her mutineer have been spawning countless mutinies across the depths of space?<br />
**Ishemok:** This...sounds profitable...<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The string is at least tens of thousands of light years in length, and possibly longer. So I wouldn't worry in the near term about it breaking<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do we have to worry about things like knots forming in it or things it might tangle on? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However it is, if I remember correctly, currently coiled around and through the Lister.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, there is really no way to predict what might happen in other locations as a result of the string<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns to Skig*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** In subspace yes<br />
*Skig secretly wonders if using a Klingon Disintegrator on Murry and the other Federation officer would be a good plan of action, but probably not something she should say out-loud.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So the only part of the lister it should directly interact with is our warp field<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't think we can leave it connected to you indefinitely, even if it has been there for 10 years<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We don't know what impacts this may have had on other people in other systems unbeknownst to anyone for the past decade<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or our shielding arrays, as evidenced by the filter I applied which caused a sympathetic vibration throughout the ship.<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Murry could have inadvertently collapsed entire civilizations just by travelling around the sector<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm sure Murry has been blowing up dozens of other unsuspecting starships with her proclivities.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Might I suggest that Hailey Murry and this mutineer need to use constructive dialogue to resolve this subspace gap; clearly something from their past has some sort of pan-dimensional gravity and perhaps needs to be counseled away.<br />
*Kurij stares off into the distance at the thought*<br />
*Hailey Murry stares off into the distance at the thought*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** (delete first)<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Words speak louder than actions, perhaps you are on to something Zox.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Part of the problem is that she's comatose, so we'll have a hard time counseling anything<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Mostly because actions do not speak, but I never claimed Tellerite sayings make sense.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It is possible that the source of all this neural energy is the pre-existing conflict between you two being amplified by the cosmic string<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr Zerra, would it be possible to rouse the officer from a comatose state?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Sticking with the tranformer analogy we have been using: defusing that tension could be like switching the power source from AC to DC<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If that's not dangerous enough, do we have another way to intinate a neural link?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Absolutely, as long as I don't make the same mistake I made with Kolea....<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suppose we could enlist a Vulcan to perform a mind-meld and allow the two of them to communicate using the Vulcan as a medium. Now... do we have any Vulcan's on board?<br />
*Zox Ponders why they don't have a Vulcan or Betazed counselor, but then realizes why he is on the Lister, thus answering his own question.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, we do have J'Davir. I believe they're positioned near the deflectors. Deck...19 I think?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nods at Kurij <br />
*Zox Nods at Kurij *<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We hate to interrupt, but the captain's security team is now approaching your position<br />
>The turbolift doors at both ends of the hall swish open and 2 security teams armed with phaser rifles step out into the corridor and begin approaching sickbay<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will make sure those floors lack explosive bolts in case the Counselor decides more random unplanned Zero-G EVA training is needed.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Maybe sending security teams down to get Skig to take some down time feels the same? <br />

*J'Davir is slightly confused by the fact that the Bynars are currently unconscious in a heap next to a computer station.*<br />
>As J'Davir strolls into sickbay, the footsteps of a large security team can be heard approaching<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Don't worry about them, they're fine. We just require your assistance with an emergency mind-meld<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** J'Davir; the Bynars have momentarily uploaded their conciousness to the main computer; while dangerous the situation called for it. <br />

**J'Davir:** Hmm... Murry, I think there is a time that it is necessary to admit there are valuable cultural differences which have to be overlooked in favor of greater cooperation and understanding.<br />
**J'Davir:** What may seem a trivial accident to you could be a heinous slight to the Bolian. For reference, I recommend mixing raw meat into Zox's salad and see what happens.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That has dietary implications, though...<br />
**J'Davir:** It may seem like a simple accident to you, but as a herbivore who considers raw meat sacriliegous to consume on days not ending in Y, it is traumetic.<br />
**J'Davir:** Hmm... so you are supposing that a Koror Soup Recipe would not contain valuable dietary supplements that might make a Bolian more at ease on a spaceship?<br />
**Lt. Jg. Elin:** Not just "a" Koror soup recipe, my dead mother's Koror soup recipe<br />
**J'Davir:** Exactly, so it is genetically crafted to ensure further mental ease for a particular Bolian.<br />
