>Skig and her team open the door to the power distribution deck and emerge from the the jeffries tube to find the entire deck crackling with electricity. Several of Skig's underlings are already burned to a crisp on the deck, and the air is tingling with the familiar sensation of high voltage<br />

**Throk:** Throk make it a point to not walk into phaser blast. Throk aware of what happens to Norn soldiers running single file into plasma repeater, he watched that episode of Babylon 5.<br />
**Throk:** It is well known Lava Lamp chief nemesis of Ship Counselor, as Lava Lamp is soothing to observe and lowers high blood pressue.<br />
**Throk:** Ergo, feeling threatened, Ship Counselor would violently attack lava lamp.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, surely there's more disasters in the making, time to check on the rest of the ship!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Aye sir, break time's over<br />
*Lt. Malat pops back to her feet, still clutching her ribs where she was thrown over her console*<br />
>As Zox and his team prepare to return to the bridge, main power flickers back online<br />

>Moments after main power comes back, the ship is rocked violently by what feels to Zox like disruptor fire<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oh right, the Jem'Hadar...<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Zox to bridge: Requesting emergency transfer of fire control from bridge to torpedo weapons deck!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hailey to Captain Baras, we encountered some Jem'Hadar invaders on the ship. They're much less keen to fight since being shown the footage and metadata of the surrender. We may be able to stop this without more damage<br />
