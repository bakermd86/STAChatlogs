>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Kolea rushes from her office to the medical beds as Zox and Geret rush Krepeka's body back into sickbay from outside. As she is placed onto the bed, the automated systems begin to immediately chime with alerts regarding her various life-threatening conditions, while her head begins to melt.<br />

>As Kolea pulls up the neuroimager, she sees numerous potentially lethal brain injuries already propogating through Krepeka's neuro-fludic matrix. Her Temporal Lobe is dangerously hot, and if not dealt with could cause permanent memory loss or loss of speech. An aneurysm is developing in the prefrontal lobe which could burst, leading to death. The anterior fluidic cortex has gone toxic and is poisoning surrounding healthy brain tissue, it could make the issue much worse if not dealt with. And the pituitary valves are ruptured, leaking nervous system fluid all over the brain./save<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Would you say you were under the influence of work related stress that caused you to remove your PPE in space?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Yeah, totally cool right?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Why is medbay full of Cardassian stasis tubes?<br />

>Zox pulls up the memory from 47120.6. He and Windbloom walk into the holodeck and see Dr. Zerra brewing tea in a room that is presumably his quarters. A similar looking Elaysian man sits on the couch near the window overlooking San Francisco. Dr. Zerra picks up both mugs of tea and heads over to sit with the other man.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Uhm... Ghex to bridge crew. So, I was up here on duty just running a navigational sensor calibration, and as you know that requires taking a continuous reference scan of a source of known luminosity in the subspace band. So I was using a nearby planetary nebula that was emitting a nice constant signal, but then the weirdest thing happened and all of a sudden there was a weird fluctuation in the signal modulation<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I thought it was probably interstellar dust, but I filtered for that and the modulation was still there, so I took a reading with the main long-range sensor array to get a spectrum so I could apply a high-pass filter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Anyways, um it was a ship. A Cardassian Keldon class cruiser.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** And now it is taking up a position .5 AU outside the salvage yard. I cut power so we will blend in with the salvage ships. But I could use some help on the bridge maybe. If you're not too busy<br />
