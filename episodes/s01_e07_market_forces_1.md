# Market Forces (Part 1)<br />

>Captain's log, Stardate 61279.4: With the Lister back in spacedock for another rebuild, I've been summoned to a tribunal to review my "command competence." Apparently two major structural rebuilds in as many months is considered "substandard command performance." 

>I am slightly offended by the suggestion, but I will simply have to present my case to the admiralty. In the meantime, I am wary of another repeat of what happened the last time the Lister was out of commission.

>So in my absense: I have ordered all crew to remain aboard the station, and I have ordered Zox to keep security details on-duty, and keep tabs on the crew. I don't think it would reflect well on my record if any of my senior officers got kidnapped during a visit to spacedock. Again.<br />

>INTERIOR - Station K4 Arboretum: With the crew confined to the station per the captain's orders, most of the Lister crew are congregating either in the station lounge or the arboretum, if not simply staring listlessly out the windows of their guest quarters. Zox and Murry are taking a look at the flora, and Murry is doing her best to convince Zox not to eat any of it<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, finally, time to relax.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We should get a bigger one of these on the Lister<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** NO DAMMIT, YOU CROSSCONNECT THE FLAXNARL CAPACITOR TO THE BLANDAL MANIFOLD!<br />
*Skig stomps by yelling into her comm badge.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** WHat would you call a bar in an arboretum?<br />
*Hailey Murry narrows her eyes at Zox*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** ...what? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well I don't know. You know your language better. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But it seems like a great idea!<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 come over with a certain spring in their step, carrying a portable computer terminal.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commander Zox, Counselor Murry, we were hoping we would find you here given the Commander's proclivity for eating foliage. We attempted to ask the computer your location, but it seems Captain Baras locked out location queries as an anti-kidnapping measure.<br />
**Ishemok:** I am glad to see you doing much better.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I am glad to see you doing much better.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes we have recovered fully from Counselor Murry shooting us<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As you may recall, that Ferengi broker who worked for the Aldazed Cartel left behind an encrypted ledger before his escape. If we recall correctly, Counselor Murry knocked it from his hands at great personal risk to herself. We have been working on breaking its encryption since then. Recently, we were able to decrypt its contents.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We had originally thought it would make sense to ask the two of you to look into it, between your investigative skills commander and your knowledge of bureaucratic structures counselor. However, Ensign Ishemok's unfortunate situation ended up presenting a perfect opportunity.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We realized that his unique financial accumen combined with his new ability to directly interface with the Lister computers made him the perfect person to analyze this ledger. So with the Lister out of commission, we took the liberty of taking the main computer functions offline and allowing Ensign Ishemok to run his cognitive functions directly on the main computer.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh? Very interesting!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** YOU WHAT?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The ledger contained a long list of numbered accounts and their transactions. Ishemok was able to run an analysis comparing the latinum values of the transactions against reported transactions from monitoried entities in order to identify some of the numbered accounts. At least those which are registered with entities that share their financial reporting data with the Federation.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We asked him to identify any suspicious entities from that list. He was able to correlate the transaction ammounts from the non-reporting accounts against transaction totals from the governments that do report to the Federation. Using that data, he identified a highly suspect Gorn hedge fund.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** This hedge fund has only ever taken deposits from numbered accounts in the ledger.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ensign Ishemok went through their investments and found that they are the majority owner a highly suspect "holding company" registered in Breen space. This holding company caught his attention because it "has no listed assets."<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Throk will not be happy to learn there is a Gorn Hedge Fund. Hedges are delicious.</font><br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The only active contract associated with the holding company is a management contract for the pension fund of a farming consortium in Klingon space<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We accessed the pension fund's balance sheet, but we were unable to progress further<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, everything you have just said is suspicious.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were hoping you could help<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, highly suspicious<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We suspect the Aldazed were comitting financial crimes<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Why yes! This sounds like exactly the sort of task we need to flex some mental muscles.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I do love the idea of a Klingon farming consortium, though<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ensign Ishemok suspects that the pension fund is being used to conceal a paper trail back to the Aldazed<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Something they don't want found<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, the Empok Nor Space Station was put up for Salvage at the end of the Dominion War. I only really remember this because on my favorite Engineering forum someone spammed all the "cross joint welding Nacelles for increased stability" threads with advertisements to come get salvage.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** but you'd appraise it as worth more than 1.6Kbars?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I believe during the occupation of Bajor, so a lot of Bajorans were undoubtedly killed operating in unsafe conditions.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The 1.6 kbars is how much Kosal is paid regularly, the rest of their paycheck comes from the salvage<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Definitely, it was not a small operation and a space station of that size would be worth decent salvage.<br />

**Throk:** There many rabbits in this place. They breed like humans.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Just a little more nerding, and we should have a good lead on that double dealing, Ketracel-Copying, Officer Kidnapping, no good ferengi.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think just yet, we don't have a ship with a warp drive and stealing one is a Reprimand waiting to happen, but I think this is interesting enough to look into in more detail. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Besides, they can't fix the Lister THAT quick.<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect group could possibly hide alternate versions of selves in Holodeck 6 claiming group bonding time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wonder if they have a rental ship for us in the mean time.<br />
**Throk:** Then Throk suspect group could steal shuttle craft with warp capable drive from loading dock 7 through Jeffries Tube from Holodeck 6 access shaft.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, maybe we should wait until the Lister is fixed... We've only got one working shuttle now and I... don't trust that thing<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No offence ma'am<br />
*Skig looks confused.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless is a perfectly functional shuttle that is able to support warp capable travel through time distortions and gravitic anomalies.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It does need a new coat of paint though.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis indicates only a 35% chance that the shuttle would explode when activating its warp core<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it would be better if we got permission from the captain to use some other, smaller ship that isn't going to fall apart on us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** One with an atmosphere and sleeping accommodations<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I bet you asked your parents for permission to go out when you were in high school too<br />
*Lt. Malat scoffs*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** My ships only fall apart when they come in contact with clumsy crew members!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What we really need to do, is go to a Sora VII Firestarters game.<br />
*Skig looks offended.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...What we really need to do is PLAY a game against the Sora VII Firestarters. <br />
*Zox shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I don't think that will help, given that the person we want to talk with has never played a game with the team he is contracted to play for.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah but it will put us close to the manager.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Why?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I'm all for a less contrived plan.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm up for anything that will get me out of the station, the Lister is in hock for another 2 weeks, and I am already going stir crazy<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wouldn't we be better suited to track down the Executive Level members of Prophet's Fortune and determine Kosal's location based on banking and accounting ledgers they would have on hand.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We could use it as the excuse to get out of the ship<br />
*Skig is NOT looking for any excuse to be away from the Lister.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, that is good, practical advice, but any sneaky rat is going to have eyes and ears around. We can't go asking good questions in the open.<br />
*Skig thinks you all are crazy to wish to be separated from the Skig's precious ship while it is in need of tender care and maintenance.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We can't?<br />
*Skig believes subterfuge is setting two traps, one obvious one and the other labeled "Coffee Maker".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's a good way to find a shorted EPS conduit, but a lousy way to find a good criminal<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Zox is right, we need a cover before we go poking around<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You can't let them know you're onto them<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Criminals are paranoid by nature<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Now, if we have long range sensors and can directly query the location of Empok Nor, I'm all for abandoning subtlety<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect if fake Ball Team had former Orion Syndicate operative who is pining for lost love as attractive face of operation that arrangements would be easier.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Good Throkk! <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I can rig up some extended sensors on Old Faithless and the location of Empok Nor is relatively well known.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The Empok Nor should have been salvaged years ago. What are the odds that it somehow got refurbished and is still in operation? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Not good.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Uhhhh, given what you guys found I'd say 100%<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You guys didn't get out enough as kids<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Honestly, as long as everyone was in EVA suits to deal with whatever biogen contagion there was, it might be possible and hiding the output as an underperorming salvage operation makes perfect sense.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** When you need to hide your duffel bag of drugs, you don't put it your locker. You give it to your cousin's girlfriend's sister to put it in the storage compartment of the crashed sand skimmer behind her house<br />
*Zox takes notes*<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: That will decide whether Skig can justify her presence to look after Old Faithless</font><br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Sure, I can probably setup some spread spectrum drug detectors on some tricoders.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** For hand inspection, right?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Whatever you have. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ok, so are we busting out or getting permission?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Captain is incommunicado in his hearing, so someone will hvae to ask the XO<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not me or Skig though, she hates us for no good reason<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I will clear it. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I can go distract Bachar by making small talk with her.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That should completely convince her to barricade herself in the executive lounge bathroom for at least four hours, like yesterday.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No need, this is a reasonable plan.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's not my fault the XO doesn't want to review line item manifests for individual bolt components as part of the refit.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Commander, I have a..<br />
*Zox is shocked.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar doesn't look up from her book*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** If you want to conspire with Murry and the Twins, next time leave Malat and Skig out of it<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Or did you think I don't keep an eye on them?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Dismissed, Commander!<br />
