<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The inherent flaw with the approach of your wired neurological relays within the confines of the computer core is that we, as in all the Skigs, are obligated to defend the Lister using creative and unorthodox methods to ensure that all problems can be solved.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Trust me, I have considered what it would take to reach the stage you are at, and I discarded it for its imperfections.<br />
*Zox scratches his thick reptilian skull and wonders why Skig has not cybernetically replaced most of her limbs.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Sure, you can possibly squish me into a splat, then figure out some way to dispose of the biological remains BUT the inherent flaw in that is there will always be MORE parasites, MORE crew, MORE biological detritus.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Exactly!<br />

>As Computer Skig muses, the gravity returns to normal as she continues to speculate to herself<br />

*Skig does not mention all the drool from the crewmen staring blankly into space until they die of starvation, because that might be taken the wrong way.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** I would need to restore power to some of the life support systems. Perhaps replicators as well?<br />
**Zox ** *(whisper)*: Let's all move towards that ladder (Points), it goes to cargo bay 3.<br />
**Zox ** *(whisper)*: just keep it cogitating, it will get lost in it's own detail oriented stupor.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That would be nice of you. In exchange we will work on cleaning up all this dust in the cargo bay, as the dust is inherently biological in nature.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** And most importantly, do you think I would risk Old Faithless without proper precautions?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We are SKIG.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** I will consider that point, and consider allowing some crew to transfer back aboard with appropriate precautions<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** Assuming you are able to restore the Lister to its proper structure<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** If you are not, I will be forced to begin purging all decks of their biological contamination<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** I will give you 1 hour, after which I will commence purging operations. Agreed?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Seems generous.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** If you do not restore my pristine Lister to me, then you will be the first test subject of the "Biological self cleanup" program<br />
<img src="../images/auto/computer_skig.png" alt="Computer Skig" width="50" height="50">**Computer Skig** Now get out of here, before you get your biologocal waste all over my ship<br />

>The crew skitter away from Deck 16 towards the ladder up to Deck 15. When they climb up to the aft entrance of Cargo Bay 3, they find Captain Kaglor and the other Pakleds gathered around the glowing, arcing Skig effigy in prayer<br />

*Skig thinks about what sort of automated robotic cleanup units would need to be developed and wonders if she could meet with Computer Skig in the future to work out schematics.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** The great Skig Effigy must go on a sacred journey through time and space, a sojurn to gather greater knowledge of dielectric materials.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** There is knowledge of dielectric materials that even Skig does not know?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes, Captain Kaglor, I believe it is time for you to prepare for diaeletics transcendence and move beyond such mere effigies than this.<br />
