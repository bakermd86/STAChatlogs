>Captains Log, Stardate 62062.3: We are completing our survey of the still unidentified spacial phenomenon in the Helothorar system. We've taken to calling it the "Kaleidoscope" on account of its mesmerizing appearance. Viraseti hasn't been able to make much sense of it, but we will have to leave by the end of the day shift in order to make our rendezvous with the research vessel USS Prudence. We have been ordered by Starfleet Command to remove the Pakleds from Cargo Bay 3 and transfer them to a more appropriate living space. Starfleet decided that allowing a Pakled religious cult to live on board a starship was not a suitable outcome.<br />

>INTERIOR - Bridge: On the viewscreen, the "Kaleidoscope" churns endlessly in the void of space. Light from distant stars, indecipherable radio signals, gravitational fluctuations, the glow of active nebulae... all churning in space, coming and going. A seething mass of energy and mystery, hanging in interplanetary space.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Does it have any relation to subspace strings, by chance? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I doubt it, if anything the opposite. Cosmic strings are 1 dimensional, this thing has dimensions we can't even understand.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I'd love to get a bit closer, we're awfully far away<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Have we sent a probe yet?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I'm already uncomfortable this close<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Let's see how safe this is...<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Commencing scan of the anomaly.<br />
*Skig walks on the bridge.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Captain, I have explained to Captain Kaglor and the Pakleds that they are going to a better place to practice and study their dialetric materials. It may be easiest to just let them have the... giant Skig effigy they have constructed.<br />
*Skig mumbles that last bit like she is mildly embarrassed she had to say it.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Well, take a team down there and make sure that the giant Skig effigy is safe to transport first. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Scanner says this thing is totally safe.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** They have an unfortunate tendency to attach everything directly to the ship's main EPS backbone<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Zox, remind me: how many times have you lit yourself on fire?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** But...it is breaking every rule of physics established so far....So we might want to get a philosophical interpretation first.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** A few times. Several times....more times than I can recall, but that's only from taking hits to the head.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** And this is why I am not moved by your feelings on what constitues "totally safe"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I bet at least one of those fires is something you still consider "safe"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** If only we had a Space Whale to find out what this was. Surely they have wisdom for this.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Geret can't go into it either<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** No one is going into it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What if it goes into us? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I missed part of the briefing while mentally diagramming a recalibration of the cross-axial saucer struts for improved tension.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** When was this first surveyed and how long as it been here?<br />
*Zox looks at Viraseti for an answer.*<br />
*Skig is hopeful that can be used as an excuse to allow for extra background exposition for the audience.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh I wouldn't worry about that ma'am, Captain Bachar ordered me to monitor with the proximity system and if the phenomenon got withtin 400,000 km to jump directly to maximum warp. I have lightning fast reflexes, when I was at the academy I scored a 9.4 on my reflex examination. The examiner said that I have an advantage because Andorians have faster than normal reflexes, but also because I'm small so my brain doesn't need to have as much of a synchronization delay for handling nerve impulses from different parts of my body. Did you know that's why bigger people have slower reflexes?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** It was reported to Starfleet by a passing transport a few weeks ago, the Lister was going to be in the area so they had us swing by to do a preliminary analysis<br />
*Zox begins to overheat his dinobrain, thinking that if it has infinite mass....then shouldn't we be pulled towards it regardless of distance?*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** They're going to have to send a proper science vessel to do a full investigation, we don't have enough time to peel back this onion...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Unless you would let me stay behind in a shuttle after the Lister heads to its rendezvous<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Have we shot a probe into it yet?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** We lost communication with the probe as soon as it neared the anomoly<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Rude<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes, our Modular Laboratories are currently configured for, "Cross pollination of erotic fauna through Apis mellifera hyperactivity during mating"<br />
*Skig double checks her PADD.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Who approved that?<br />
*Zox shrugs.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Well we aren't have time to get to the bottom of this one, Viraseti can finish up her report with whatever we can figure out. In the meantime, Skig take a team down to the Cargo Bay and deal with the Pakled situation. Make sure they are all packed up, including any giant Skig effigies, before the end of the day.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes ma'am<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** It seems wrong to kick them out<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Yeah, they're like totally chill down there<br />
*Skig leaves to get a team with approprirate electrical grounding equipment.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I'd assemble a security team Malat. They may not want to go.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I'm not going to remove them by force<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I don't think we have to, we can lure them out into a better location<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How did they fare during the vole incursion, by the way?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** C'mon, we should go with Skig. I want to see this effigy before she tears it down<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Yeah, that's pretty funny<br />
>INTERIOR - Cargo Bay 3: Skig, Murry, Zox, Malat and Windbloom open the door to the Cargo Bay. The Pakleds are gathered around a 6 meter tall effigy of Skig, praying. Skig's eyes are glowing with the purple plasma of high frequency electrical discharge. You can taste the ozone in the air as you walk in.<br />

**Pakleds** Ooooohhhhhmmmmm<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** If anything it looks friendlier than Skig.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Oh good, they fixed the part where bolts of lightning shot from the ass.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** In sermon today, we explore poly vinyl acrylate. PVA has high dielectric constant, and is bendy. But it is too sticky. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Sticky is not good for a dielectic<br />
*Zox waits for Skig to come up with a bogus rationale of a 'pilgrimage' in search of new dielectric materials which they must embark on.*<br />
>The Pakleds all shake their heads and murmor<br />

*Captain Kaglor puts his hand into a tub of PVA and then grabs onto a live exposed wire*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh that might not be good<br />
*Captain Kaglor howls in pain as he is shocked badly, but does not let go of the wire.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think he's glued to it. More than usual for an electric shock<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** This... is... why... sticky... bad<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Wow... Maybe you should help him<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Hrm. Im not sure if this is within safe word Kolea territory, or getting to edgy Neraran territory...<br />

*Captain Kaglor looks at Skig*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hello Captain! I see your sermon on the mysteries of dialetric materials was very electrifying.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Yes, sticky is not good for dielectric<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Indeed, sticky is quite bad.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Every day we understand more about the dielectric materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** They actually are starting to work out some surprising depth of knowledge in them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Someday we will be as smart as Skig<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I have great news, you and all here have been chosen to go on a pilgrimage to a place where you can study even more materials.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** It is an exciting opportunity to not only learn more, but to share all that you have learned with those less knowledgeable about these mysteries.<br />
*Skig thinks she did a relatively decent job of reciting the speech Kolea made her memorize for this occasion.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Yes, I understand<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** The Lister does not have enough dielectric materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Precisely.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** We have mastered these dielectric materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Let us pray<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Your wisdom and knowledge is getting very thorough of what we can offer here.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Perhaps we should gift them some PPE....<br />
>A Pakled runs over and turns up the power to the Skig effigy on the control panel. The entire thing starts arcing into the air, and glowing blue and purple with the plama discharge<br />

>As they do so, the ship suddenly rocks violently, knocking everyone to the deck<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** The anomaly...it hungers...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Zox, please don't say that while the lights are flickering<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Energy....Power...it's addicted to them!<br />
>As Zox and Murry crack jokes, the ship shudders violently again, throwing the room into dissarray. Boxes and barrels topple over, the Skig effigy begins to tip, Pakleds fall into the large open tub of glue.<br />

*Skig has a momentary fear that the Pakled's have "prayed" the Kaleidosocope Anamoly into existence and are actually feeding it... because weirder things have happened.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Zox to Ghex; what is our distance to the anomaly?<br />
*Skig kills power to the effigy again.*<br />
*Skig noticed that she has been mispronouncing "anomaly" since Sophomore astrophysics and no one has corrected her.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Skig kills the power to the effigy, and it stops glowing and arcing. As the acrid smell of ozone begins to clear, the Pakleds look around confused.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** What happened? Does your ship need more dielectric materials?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We're not sure yet<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** I think the ship wants more dielectric materials. You had better feed it<br />

*Skig taps comm badge as she steps out of the cargo bay.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Skig to Captain Bachar, I am working on packing up the Pakleds, what is the situation up there?<br />
>As Skig taps her commbadge, it makes a dull *thunk* sound but she gets no reply<br />

>Before Skig can turn to leave, the door opens and a short, stout Tellerite woman in an engineering uniform storms in and goes directly to the main EPS interlink panel for the room, while mumbling under her breath<br />

**Tellerite Woman (Mumbling)** What could possibly be using so much power in here... It's always something with these...<br />
*Skig looks to see if Skig is watching herself.*<br />
*Skig offers advice to other Skig.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Make sure to rewire those cross-feeds in a split beam configuration to ensure redundancy on the third tier EPS circuit going through cargo bay 2 and behind the left alternator panel before it hits the Steam Generator next to the mainframe, or else the punch cards will get soggy.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think we should see if we can make it up to the bridge to see what's up<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Or if there even is a bridge<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, probably a good idea<br />

Written by Sechnall Everald
Directed by Apolena Christianson<br />

*Zox is curious if Skig #3 will outrank original Skig.*<br />
*Skig is horrified to think there is a Captain Skig, Admiral Skig, or High Lord of the Adeptus Mechanicus Skig running around.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Deck 15: Skig, Skig, Skig and the others stand outside the access hatch to the Jeffries tube and consider the situation they find themselves in. Lt. Commander Skig is wearing a blue sciences uniform, with her hair done up in a tight bun and her beard more neatly trimmed than your Skig. Chief Skig has a scruffy, untrimmed beard and loose tousled hair. All seem perplexed by the situation.<br />

*Skig gives Petty Officer Skig a thumbs up.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Let's get to the bridge and see what happened in our absence.<br />
**Hailey Murry ** *(to Zox)*: I'm not sure if they're the same, it seems like they're quite different in some aspects<br />
*Skig climbs on the ladder and begins to ascend to the next deck.*<br />
**Windbloom Openheart (To Zox)** I'll be honest, I'm still not entirely convinced I didn't mess up my dosage<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Chief Science Officer Skig and Chief Petty Officer Skig, let's get to the bottom of this.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** Then I agree<br />
**Zox ** *(To Hailey)*: Tricorder can't tell them apart. Skig-prime is just one possibility in an infinitely fractal undulating universe<br />
*Skig is really gareful at the start of this episode that Viraseti didn't remember the Advanced Research Facilities for long term investigative research were installed during the prior refit as a justification for moving the Lister closer to the crazy zone.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Perhaps on the inside, we are all Skigs?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Just in case we start running across extra versions of other people, I would suggest we avoid Medical. I have a weird feeling alternate versions of Kolea could be terrifying to encounter.<br />

>As Skig ascends the Jeffries Tube, each deck they pass registers on their scanners as they pass through. By the time they have climbed up to Deck 11, they can only read the small piece of the Lister neck that falls into Deck 11 <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** To be honest, I'm more worried about the Neraran-analog version of her.<br />

*Skig looks at Lt Cmdr Skig.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I am hypothesizing that the existence of this strange fractal plane is bound to our mutual cross dimensional existence. What does your tricoder show from the last several decks of readings?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** I suspect it is related to the anomoly we were studying <br />

<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** I had gone to deck 13 to manually reprogram a probe to attempt to get better results<br />
