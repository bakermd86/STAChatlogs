>INTERIOR - Bridge: Dr. Malov's ship comes into visual range and appears on the viewscreen. The name has been changed since last you saw it, as it is now emblazoned with the name "Means of Production." Moments later, the familiar face of Dr. Malov appears on the screen.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Let me just first start by offering my sincere apology about that whole kidnapping affair the last time we met<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** You have to understand that, as union president, I am sworn to faithfully execute the will of the union body in the execution of my dutires<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** You'll be pleased to know that union membership has grown significantly since then and the union no longer predominantly focuses on criminal activity<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** We are presently engaged in a large-scale industrial action.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Did the Nausicaans overthrow you?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** No, many of the original crew have left but some chose to stay behind in exchange for receiving a comfortable percentage of union dues as a salary in exchange for their vital security services<br />
*Skig decides to address the situation by remaining in the cargo bay and teaching the Pakleds about the dangers of electrocution.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm glad it sounds like things are looking better, though it sounds like the struggle is ongoing. We're a little more concerned with that ship of Pakleds...<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Guys, do we have a personal cult army right now?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Ah yes, the Pakleds only recently joined the union. They were enthusiastic, but they seem to have misunderstood several important points<br />
*Throk walks past the view screen chewing on Pakled entrails.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Quite. I hope there's no hard feelings about us breaking out of your ship? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** None at all, I personally was never in favor of kidnapping as a source of funding<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What sort of business production have you taken up?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** We have established a much more regularlized system of union dues paid by our members to fund our operation. We do not directly engage in commerce as a union of course, our budget is used to support union members in their negotiations with management <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Who are the management?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The Pakleds, for instance, had been tricked into signing exploitative labor contracts in which they were being paid only in the form of worthless trilitium geodes that would be produced as a mining biproduct.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Somehow the mine management had tricked them into thinking the geodes were rare and valuable.<br />
*Throk has a new Value for this episode.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): That which you cannot eat strengthens your jaw</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I see. I might recommend that they be provided union representation to aid them in their negotiations in the future. And perhaps a few minders, to help keep an eye on them. They were raiding ships for electrical insulation <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): There might be a translation error with this famous Gorn saying.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, perhaps you didn't quite impart the lesson, prof...yes that.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Well as I said, they misunderstood some key points. But they are not the only workers involved in this strike<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh quite. I might suggest that they're not quite at the level to look after their own affairs<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Wait, which strike?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The mining consortium has refused to negotiate new contract terms, so we have enacted a sector-wide picket line to obstruct the mine's operations<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Picket Line? Why do I suspect there is a line of sentry ships attacking cargo vessels?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** Yes, the Pakleds were supposed to stop those ore tenders and destroy their cargo, not strip their power systems of insulation<br />
*Kolea is worried Dr Malov's efforts are being miscontrued.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** They left the cargo, I'm afraid<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The GORMAS is blocking mine operations throughout this sector, and will continue until management agrees to better contract terms<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Can you forward over your contract terms? I'm curious what you've whipped up. <br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Every other gimmick goes into the rabbit hole and returns. Legalese? Well F that. Bless you Fen.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** That is the problem: management has thus far refused to negotiate with the union at all<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Who are the mining consortium out here?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** "K'Mot's Jewels." They are an FCA-licensed inter-jurisdictional consortium<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** When the work force agreed to unionize, they fried everyone and replaced the entire workforce with new workers or automated robots <br />

<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** for whatever reason, management has been completely unwilling to even open negotiations<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How much difficulty did they have in finding new workers?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** I don't know whether it was difficult for them, but it didn't take them very long<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** We have intercented hundreds of ships as part of our strike though, so the operation must be costing them tens of thousands of bars of latinum<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I think you need to update your methods and seize the memes of production. Have you considered some negative press for K'mot Jewels?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Hm. That's interesting. Would you like us to reach out on your behalf to see if we can open negotiations? <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Hrm. So it seems K'mot actually sells to the Federation...there's some leverage.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Surely the Federation will not buy dubiously sourced materials!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Much like Pakleds when exposed to industrial ovens with not enough sauce!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Not... helping?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** If you think you can track down K'Mot and convince him to negotiate, I can beam over with a small team and join you<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** The Means of Production has to stay behind on the picket line though, she is the strongest ship that the union has<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** That sounds great!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you have anyone within your union who has information on who they were selling to specifically? <br />
*Kolea prepares the "Ready Room" in Sickbay for Dr Malov Booty Calls.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/dr_malov.png" alt="Dr. Malov" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Malov** No, we don't have access to their records. That is something we would request in negotiations, to determine what a fair salary would be<br />
*Throk offers Captain Bachar some Pakled entrail sausage.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** But we are not going to intervene with force here, this is not our jurisdiction. We are acting strictly as an impartial mediator<br />

>INTERIOR - Cargo Bay 3: By the time T'Kor, Zox and Malat get to the cargo bay and join Skig, the Pakleds appear to have extensively decorated the cargo bay with long strings of exposed electrical cable, sparking against the hull plating. In the corner of the cargo bay, they have set up a large conical shaped pile of wiring and metal plates which appears to be connected to the secondary of a tesla coil. It is flashing brightly with huge, high-frequency electrical arcs all around it<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Fortunately it goes through auxiliary conduit breaker C, so we can flip one switch and disable the whole thing.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** As Gra'lan might remember though, we actually had to do things like this on Excelsior class ships to keep the shuttles from exploding in low humidity environments.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Yes. The Resistmas tree has very high voltage. And the dielectric materials have very high resistance. <br />
