<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): As soon as Kolea notices the Changeling Suit is missing, she is going to contact Dr Malov and warn him that Jasanis is on the ship, running free, and has the Changeling Suit so he needs to lock everything down. She will remind him that Orions do not have sex with corpses, so "No Playtime if you die".</font><br />


>Captains log, Stardate 61714.1: While en route to Starbase 73 to pick up the rest of our crew from leave, we received an unusual distress call from a Federation research outpost in the Orlana system. Our computer records indicate that the outpost only has a small research staff of a few dozen, but the distress claims that they are having a maintenance issue which could threaten trillions of lives. I don't really understand, but to be on the safe side I asked Lt. Commander Skig to put together an engineering team and assess the situation.

Dr. Zerra also tells me that he lost the telemetry from his health monitoring device implanted in Lt. Commander Zox. He says it may just be interference, but just in case I asked Amondi to check if he has any next-of-kin we may need to notify.<br />

>INTERIOR - USS Lister, Transporter room: As Skig gets her away team ready for transport, Lt. Commander Viraseti shows up wearing a tricorder and carrying a PADD.<br />

**Gra'lan:** I've got my slide rule, abacus, and astrolabe packed! Let's see what sort of automata needs some maintenancin!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I hope you don't mind if I join the away team<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, did you remember your sundial and magnetic compass?<br />
*Skig looks at Viraseti.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I do not, any particular reason you want to join us?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yessir Skig-boss! We have full sensors in case of interference!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good, I also want to make sure we can generate inference.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Just in case there's anything unexpected down there, it is a research outpost after all<br />
*Skig wonders if Gra'lan's presence is due to the show picking up the National Antiquarian's Guild as a sponsor.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very well, I was expecting something like your long estranged third cousin was expecting their seventh child and you wanted to visit since we were here.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti squints her eyes and raises an eyebrow at Skig*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or some other plausible reason for you to be very familiar with the situation.<br />
*Skig directs her team to get on the pads.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Four to beam down.<br />
>INTERIOR - Orlana Conservation Research: Skig and her team materialize on the planet's surface, ready for a plasma leak, out-of-control fire, fusion reactor overload, or other catastrophic maintenance issue warranting a distress call. Instead, they see a lot of people milling around, chatting, drinking coffee, and generally not seeming overly concerned.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, the coffee machines are working.<br />
>The outpost has a pleasant, naturalistic aesthetic. Lots of greenery, no alarms or signs of danger are present<br />

**Gra'lan:** sneezes<br />
*Gra'lan: snezes*<br />
*Skig channels her inner Zox and Murry and calls down an orbital strike on the facility while rampaging around as a radiation infused kaiju.*<br />
>A short Tellerite man with a thick mustache comes running over, breathing heavily and sweating profusely.<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Just kidding.</font><br />
**Yalak:** Oh thank goodness you're here<br />
**Gra'lan:** What seems to be the trouble? Other than these blasted plants getting busy with the atmosphere?<br />
**Yalak:** Oh thank goodness you're here<br />
**Yalak:** It's better if I show you, come with me<br />
*Gra'lan: continues sneezing from the plants*<br />
*Yalak leads the away team to a large lecture hall which is set up with symphony seating on the stage*<br />
**Yalak:** Observe please<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very well.<br />
*Yalak plays a note on the piano on the stage, and the sound system begins making increasingly awful feedback sounds from the loud speakers, quickly becoming so loud as to be painful*<br />
*Skig observes what the attractive Tellerite wishes to show her.*<br />

**Yalak:** You see the problem?<br />
*Yalak turns off the sound system and the feedback dies down*<br />
**Oakadan:** No, but I heard a problem. What happened? <br />
**Gra'lan:** Is this...Disaster Area?<br />
**Yalak:** Yes, this is a huge disaster<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
**Yalak:** Trillions of lives are at stake<br />
**Gra'lan:** eh?<br />
*Yalak nervously wipes sweat from his brow*<br />
**Oakadan:** Perhaps you should back up a step, and walk us through what the purpose of this is<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Are you by any chance counting the lives of all the airborne bacteria coming from the plants suffering an untimely death due to acoustic assault?<br />
**Yalak:** This is our lecture hall, normally it is used for symposia that we host here. But this week is our annual gala and we have the Andoria Philharmonic to play a selection of the great Andorian composers for our board of directors<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do things other than the piano operate normallly?<br />
**Yalak:** No, it is the entire sound system. Any music feeds back horribly<br />
**Yalak:** It will completely ruin the concert<br />
**Gra'lan:** How does that put trillions of lives in the balance?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan, this looks like some sort of cross-wiring situation of the analog to digital convergence system. Can you see if you can give it a tune-up while I check on something?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yes sir! Right away!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oakadan, with me.<br />
**Gra'lan:** I mean..Yes mam!<br />
*Skig heads back out of the room.*<br />
**Yalak:** This planet is a wildlife refuge for thousands of critically endangered species.  Our annual gala ensures we get the needed political support from the Federation Science Foundation to continue our work here<br />
*Gra'lan produces a 'Baby's first wiring kit by Radio Shack' box and begins working.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Sweet, is that the one with or without the "lick here" wiring for the batteries?</font><br />
>Skig leads Oakadan out of the lecture hall, following her tricorder. She sees Viraseti having a heated discussion with a human scientist in his mid-to-late 40s<br />

*Skig patiently observes whatever conversation Viraseti is having that distracted her.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No, we came out here responding to a distress call <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But while I'm here...<br />

*Skig offers some popcorn to Oakadan.*<br />

*Dr. Gallego accepts the PADD, then runs away*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(whispers back)*: No, I'm pretty sure Gra'lan will start the entire building on fire shortly and that will distract us.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(whispers further)*: Nevermind.<br />
**Oakadan ** *(murmurs)*: I'd like to slip around and ask for his viewpoint on all of this, if that's okay? Virasti should be able to assist you<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti grunts in frustration, then turns around and sees Skig and Oakadan*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Why don't you two go fix something<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(whispers)*: Oh sure, don't get shot. The Lister's fire suppression system needs it's annual maintenance next month.<br />
*Skig looks at Viraseti.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Rather strangely, I see something right in front of me that looks like it needs fixing.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I thought the Klingons killed all the Tribbles<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Tribbles have proven to be almost impossible to exterminate. The best we can hope for is a Klingon Ship Cat.<br />
*Yalak comes over, drawn by the smell of extra crispy Tribble*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent work Gra'lan, can you work with that handsome Yalak chap to make sure the conduit ducting is safe from further infestation and then we can work out a safe transport method for any surviving ones?<br />
*Yalak blushes slightly*<br />
**Yalak:** Oh well, I don't think you'll be transport the Tribble population. They have really thrived on this continent<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In that case, we shall just need to Tribble-proof things a bit.<br />
**Yalak:** so much so that they have displaced all of the other land animals from this continent and we have had to resettle them on other land masses<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yeah, we aren't solving this with engineering. This system might need an ecological solution.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** By definition, is that not the example of an invasive species?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Anything I put to insulate the wires is probably gonna get chewed through<br />
**Yalak:** This is a wildlife refuge, and this is the last known population of Tribbles in the Alpha Quadrant<br />
**Gra'lan:** Best you could do is put a big pile 'a grain somewhere and distract them until this concert is over.<br />
*Skig secretly suspects this is a problem Neraran is ideally suited to resolve.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah, my mistake.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I thought the Tribbles were present on other systems?<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Gra'lan): Daleks are teh solution to Tribbles.</font><br />
**Yalak:** Not since the Klingons declared them a mortal enemy of the Empire<br />
**Yalak:** They fought a decades long campaign to exterminate them<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This does explain why the "Gift Box of Tribbles" on Bajor-a-zon Primt has gone up in price so much and they do not ship to Klingon space since the times of Montgomery Scott.<br />
**Yalak:** Yes, shipping a box of tribbles through Klingon space would be considered trafficing in illegal weapons and would warrant a death penalty under Klingon law<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In any case, it is a known quantity, let's find an engineering solution to keep the sound system safe and the Tribbles content and happy.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Well, it's true Skig. Ecology is just a degenerate form of engineering. How to contain an r regulated, invasive species for a week?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's the spirit, let me know if you need T'Kor's help to cook something up.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): ...I hope you all appreciate that...</font><br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I will look at the literature, it is pretty unusual for such a sedentary species to cause an issue like this<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have certainly not heard of something like it happening before<br />
*Gra'lan looks at Viraseti.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Ma'm. I think they are hungry as heck.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thank you Lisa.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Some jerk probably left behind half eaten food in the seating, and that drove the little snuggle-poos nuts<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan, they were not by any chance using Platarium XC axial coating on the acoustic systems wiring?<br />

**Gra'lan:** I don't think they were. I didn't know they had to teethe.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It was removed from the approved cabling list on starships about fifty years ago, but the Lister has it on Decks 7-24 and getting replacement cabling is quite challenging.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** They love to gum the coating off the cabling, which exposes the core and causes them to start burning.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very unfortunate.<br />
**Gra'lan:** May I suggest we update the transporter saftey protocols to avoid getting them onboard?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent idea.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Any other items before I update the Captain?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Also, anyone eat these things here? I was going to throw them out, but if any species finds them tasty, who am I to judge?<br />
*Skig sends an update to Captain Baras on the situation that the problem seems to be a troubling but benign Tribble infestation and Skig recommends the Transporter protocols get updated to screen for Tribbles due to the presence of the wiring on the ship which the Tribbles would find delicious.*<br />
>EXTERIOR - Jem'Hadar Colony: Murry, Zox, Kolea and the Twins have been put up in a comfortable pair of rooms constructed from what looks like the wreckage of a Starfleet vessel. A Nebula class warp nacelle and part of a saucer section can be seen crashed into the mountain range in the distance, along with the front half of a Jem'Hadar battleship. The grounds of the colony are green and pleasant though, with logs of Jem'Hadar dressed in a variety of different styles of clothing engaging in a variety of leisure activities like Yoga, mediation, pottery, knitting, etc.<br />

**T'Pau:** We have little reason to withhold any information from you<br />
**T'Pau:** Now that our contract with Jasanis is complete<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can you tell us more about the Founders, and what would cause one to pose as a Starfleet Officer?<br />
**T'Pau:** The Founders went to war with Starfleet, many of them posed as Starfleet officers<br />
**T'Pau:** Just as many Starfleet officers conduct espionage against the enemies of the Federation<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How much do you know about Jasanis's secret contact?<br />
**T'Pau:** I do not know what contacts she may or may not have, just that she claimed she could produce Ketracel White<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So she contacted you?<br />
**T'Pau:** Based on the notes she beamed down when she fled, she had to capture a Founder and use its morphogenic matrix as part of the production process<br />

>The feed from the bug starts up and you see the inside of the cargo hold on Jasanis' ship, you see her talking to Dr. Malov <br />

**Dr. Malov:** Are you sure about this?<br />
**Jasanis:** It'll be fine, it should be fine. I think it's fine. Is it fine?<br />
**Jasanis:** Just get out of here before I change my mind<br />
*Dr. Malov nods and leaves*<br />
>The Jem'Hadar particle canister dematerializes from the cargo bay on Jasanis' cruiser and materliazes on a landing pad in a busy spaceport somewhere.<br />

>Jasanis sits akwardly on top of another canister holding a trigger device similar to the one she used on Ilitz Prime. She is fidgeting with the trigger mechanism, and occasionally whistling a tune.<br />

>A few minutes later, a Cardassian male and a Trill female wearing unremarkable civilian clothes materialize near the canisters. They are standing in the shadows, and keep their heads down, so you can't see their faces very well on the feed. Jasanis activates the dead-man switch on the trigger device and holds it out prominently.<br />

**Cardassian Male:** What is that supposed to be?<br />
**Jasanis:** A detonator. Just some insurance, you know? In case... You know, so that to make sure that you release the funds from escrow. Otherwise, boom!<br />
>Jasanis chuckles nervously.<br />

**Cardassian Male:** How dramatic. I'll call off the orbital strike.<br />
>Jasanis looks up at the sky and ducks behind a crate.<br />

**Trill Female:** That was a joke, relax. We'll authorize the funds transfer as soon as we verify the contents.<br />
>The Trill female takes out a scanner of some kind and begins to scan several canisters. As she does, Jasanis stands back up, crosses, uncrosses, then re-crosses her arms.<br />

**Trill Female:** Energy readings are consistent with what we expected, it looks like it is good.<br />
**Jasanis:** Of course it is, I always keep my word.<br />
**Cardassian Male:** I seriously doubt that. I'll transfer the funds now and you can be on your way.<br />
>The Cardassian taps some commands into a PADD. A few moments later, Jasanis' PADD chimes and she checks it, then disarms the trigger device.<br />

**Cardassian Male:** Well that was awefully public, I suppose they don't teach the fine art of "subtlety" at the academy.<br />
**Trill Female:** What do you mean, that wasn't me. I was going to beam a bomb onto her ship when she beamed out. I thought that was you.<br />
**Cardassian Male:** I am hurt that you would think so little of me. That I would assasinate a valued business partner. In such a sloppy manner. Nevertheless, we shouldn't linger too long... Sweep the canisters for bugs and let's get out of here.<br />

**Kolea:** I notice you didn't try to think of what I'd do in this situation?<br />

**Gra'lan:** Well, I'd say your environmental controls have gotten chewed too, either that or you are hiding a heavy chemical factory somewhere abouts?<br />

**Gra'lan:** Perhaps we should check with environmentals?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Definitely, and trace when this started and see if it is a result of clearing the tribble-clog.<br />

*Oakadan takes a deep breath of actually clean air.*<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Well tribbles do metabolize bromine, which is fairly unique among mammal species<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** So they could be related, at least to the ethyl bromide<br />

**Luatoria Dural:** Now you listen here you greasy little pig man, I have violinists throwin up all over the floor, and a percussion section that is curled up under their marimbas<br />
**Gra'lan:** Weelll sir. I suggest beaming everything edible off the continent and waiting a few days. No other way really.<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** This is unacceptable, we are a respectable orchestra. We will not tolerate these conditions<br />
*Yalak runs to Skig*<br />
**Yalak:** Um, help?<br />
*Yalak hides behind Skig from the wrath of the fancy Betazed woman*<br />
**Oakadan ** *(Quietly to Skig)*: The facility is not yet at a dangerous level of gas, but we need to look into this. Eventually, the concentration will turn this place into a pressurized bomb.<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** A BOMB!?!?<br />
**Gra'lan:** If only we had one'a those biologists around, and had a way to even more rapidly dimimish their food supply. Cause we arent' doing it with any other form of pest control, that's all a lot of gimmicks.<br />
*Skig looks at the Betazed woman.*<br />
*Luatoria Dural people around the room turn toward Luatoria and begin to look uncomfortable*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is an engineering problem caused by a surrfeit of excessive pressure brought about by unintended gas emissions.<br />

*Luatoria Dural points toward all the vomiting people around the room*<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** Is that not obvious?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan, Oakadan, can you investigate further what can be done about the pressure and gas differential to remediate the situation? Carry on gentlemen.<br />
*Skig looks at the Betazed woman.*<br />

**Gra'lan:** Dr. Gallego, isn't there some sort of plant that can reverse that reaction? Why can't we get that counter-exponentiating the tribbles till we deal with them?<br />
*Skig admires porcine man's lustrous hair for a second.*<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti raises an eyebrow toward Skig*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Oh wow. <br />

**Gra'lan:** And no way to stop their emissions except some of the biological exponentiating systems<br />
**Gra'lan:** We just don't have mechanical scaling power like that. Not since they banned grey-goo.<br />

**Dr. Gallego:** Conservation Ecology<br />
**Gra'lan:** besides getting people angry enough to chase you with paperwork?<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, if Dr Gallego and Lt. Gra'lan can work on mass producing a counteragent via natural means that would be good.<br />
**Yalak:** I am more concerned with how so many tribbles can be active right now<br />
**Yalak:** I thought they weren't supposed to undergo another breeding cycle for years<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Who would be the tribble expert among this science station's staff?<br />
**Oakadan:** I can't get a clean scan in the area, but I think we should check to see if the surroundings are just as saturated or if it's just the facility <br />
**Gra'lan:** Dr. Gallego, can we do a computer search to scour the knowledge of what is known about tribbles and work from there?<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** I have a decent familiarity with them, we don't really have an on-site expert, they mostly take care of themselves<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oakadan, let me introduce you to science officer Viraseti, who can probably work with you to come up with a scanning solution.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Ordinarily, they have a periodic lifecycle. Like Cicadas back on Earth<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** When they undergo a breeding cycle, they emerge in huge numbers and congregate together to breed<br />
**Gra'lan:** Right, but if tribbles make gas, then something certainly evolved to make use of that plentiful energy. An ecosystem is just a degenerate circuit. What creature is that, that's what I want to find?<br />
**Oakadan:** Lt Commander. Shall we? We may need to go a fair distance to avoid contamination <br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Their last breeding cycle was only 3 years ago, and it is ordinarily a 9-12 year cycle<br />

*Throk is amazed how Bachar's arm stretches from out-of-scene to hand a water spritzer bottle to Malat.*<br />
**Geret:** But there's priceless species down there being conserved! <br />
**T'kor:** I think there is a fair amount of diplomacy going on sometimes, rather than any underlying scientific or emergency issue. <br />
**Geret:** Having planets like this escape the ruthless industrialization, or the scourge of intergalacic war is the gem of what the Federation stands for!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There are hundreds of thousands of class-M planets in the Federation, with trillions upon trillians of lifeforms on them<br />
**T'kor:** Though also, even the most menial tasks always seem to be unexpectedly complicated. My time among my people was far less notable<br />

**Throk:** Now, Throk not worry about bigger problems.<br />
**Geret:** But but...Zox-senpai taught me that all life is to be treasured, and that even humans were just these adorable, seemingly helpess creatures when they left Earth. <br />

**Geret:** I know I know, but that left him an emotional rex on the inside.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well speaking of Zox, it would be good if we can clear his name. If for no other reason, he is the chief of security. His help could be useful in running this down<br />

*Throk offers some chewing gum to Malat so she doesn't damage her teeth from the grinding noise.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I didn't request a transfer to the Lister, I requested a transfer to fill the open first officer posting on the USS Resolute<br />
**Throk:** Small angry woman not want to injure self and require medical treatment under current situation.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** When I got assigned here, I suspected something was up<br />
**Geret:** But...if you know everything, and see everything, and still don' know what's going on...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Whoever is behind this is good, very good<br />
**Throk:** Throk convinced Zox now completely innocent.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Yeah, I am inclined to agree. <br />
**T'kor:** Indeed. Which then brings us down to the question of who has the technical capabilities to hack into Zox's suit<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If he pulled one over on me, I would resign<br />
**Geret:** Hrm. It's unlikely any one person could be this proficient. Someone would need a 24-7 accomplice. <br />
**Geret:** Like, ya know, two people.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I agree that we can't assume it is only one person<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** This Janus that Skig told T'Kor about may or may not be the same as whoever was involved in the assassination, and may or may not be the same as whoever hacked Zox's suit<br />
**Throk:** There are many threads here, like excessive plate of all you can eat spaghetti when replicator on deck 18 breaks.<br />
**T'kor:** It looks like Dr Zerra lost someone in 2370. Who would that have been? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Looks like his brother<br />
**T'kor:** Malat, how did you get in Star Fleet the second time? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Starfleet believes in second chances, it takes more than an expulsion to get me down<br />
**T'kor:** I commend you for your determination<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** More importantly: Malat was in lockup when the assassination attempt happened, so we can be confident she wasn't involved<br />
**Throk:** So we need to find who tried hacking Zox suit? Also need to investigate service records and postings for location in 2379, and removing those who are definitely not suspicious, like small angry woman and Zox.<br />
**Throk:** Also safe to assume that gooey flexible woman is not assassin, unless her goal is to mislead everyone.<br />
*Throk sniffs at Bachar.*<br />
**Throk:** Nope, I think she safe.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If I was an assassin I would have blown up the shuttle full of people who learned about the presence of an assassin<br />
**Throk:** See, further proof.<br />
**Throk:** Throk have silly question.<br />
**Throk:** How we know geriatric captain not involved?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We have been keeping this pretty quiet, only myself and Dr. Zerra know about it, but the Captain has a degenerative brain disease. He can barely remember where he is at any given time<br />
**Geret:** I thought that was the cocktails...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I have to brief him four or five times a day so he can stay on top of things<br />
**Geret:  [d100 = 16]**<br />
**T'kor:** Who did you assault in 2379?<br />
**Throk:** Starfleet take better care of old people than Gorn. In Gorn space we coat in thick layer of sauce and toss on to walking BBQ pit to celebrate life.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Captain of the K'Tora<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** she and I never got on<br />

**Throk:** It seems most likely Dr Zerra, Viraseti, or Twins are suspects.<br />
**Throk:** Twins are currently with Murray and Zox.<br />
**Throk:** I assume Murray is not suspicious because she is too violent to assassinate without use of explosives.<br />
**Geret:** I will take care of investigating the twins, who, are in  my appraisal, the most likely, because they have a perfect partner in crime that they are emotionally blackmailed to.<br />
**Throk:** Murray would not use poison, she much prefer explosives or vsiceral stabbing with knife with excessive glee on face, much like when she saws Nausicaan heads off.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If you feel you need permission to access any of their personal logs or enter their quarters, consider it given<br />
**Throk:** In fact, now Throk think about it, Murray look much happier stabbing people than when pregnant with Zox's children.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If there is any inquest in the future, I'll take full responsibility for any violations of protocol here<br />
**Throk:** Mammals are weird creatures.<br />
**Geret:** Commander Bachar, can you resolve one point of ambiguity here?<br />
**Geret:** Can you confirm that neither the twins, either of them, Zerra, or Viraseti, is a founder themselves?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** No way, we can feel one-another with physical contact<br />
**Geret:** Thank you! That reduces variables by much!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** It's why I shook your hand when Skig told me you were a changeling impersonaing Zox<br />
**Throk:** Throk remind that Twins are with Murry and Zox. Zox suit was hacked by Lister. Therefore, if Twins are prime suspect, they have help from someone here.<br />
**Geret:** but we are different. interesting.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or they have a data uplink<br />
**Geret:** Or they use a relay. <br />
**Geret:** Yes.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe you're not as stupid as you look<br />
*Geret changes to look exactly like Malat.*<br />
**Geret:** do I look smart now?<br />
*Throk hands Malat a Klingon Bat'leth in case she wants to smack Geret with it.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Knock it off, we don't have time for this <br />
**Throk:** Time is ephemeral and can be adjusted as needed.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I have to brief the captain... again.. You four figure out how Zox's suit got hacked, and see what else you can find<br />
**Geret:** Oh it commander!<br />
**Geret:** We will make you proud!<br />
>INTERIOR - Transport: Zox, Murry, Kolea and the Twins fly towards a rendezvous with Dr. Malov and his newly unionized crew.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That was a refreshing diversion! So bizzare to be so relaxed on a planet full of Jem'Hadar.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It was an.. unexpected outcome<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** However, we consider it a hopeful sign that the Jem'Hadar could someday become less of a threat to peace<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Assuming the Dominion do not wipe them out<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are approaching the rendezvous position, the FFI beacon on Jasanis' ship has apparently reactivated with a registry title of "Solidarity"<br />
**Kolea:** I certainly hope the Jem'Hadar are able to survive and adapt, it was very nice to see an alternative version of them.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 the twins bring the shuttle in and land in the docking back of the newly named Solidarity*<br />
>When the hatch opens, you see Dr. Malov and several of his Nausicaan crew waiting to greet you at the base of the ramp<br />

**Dr. Malov:** It's a pleasant surprise to see you again so soon<br />
*Kolea looks for statue of Jimmy Hoffa.*<br />
**Kolea:** It is always a pleasure to see you.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I was just thinking the same thing<br />
*Kolea gives Dr Malov "elevator eyes" in return.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So what brings you out here? Other than the obvious<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Has the Ferengi gone into shock or has he found a way to profit by these new arrangements?<br />
**Kolea:** I'm here for the booty call.<br />
*Kolea smacks Dr Malov on the ass and walks out of the hangar.*<br />
*Zox is still confused by mammals.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I convinced him that his labor was being exploited in his prior position, and he can benefit from the full value of his hard work under a more equitable system<br />
**Dr. Malov:** And after we dropped off Jasanis at her rendezvous, we even found time to hold our first union elections<br />
*Kolea wanders back over.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So that the voice of the workers can be realized<br />
**Kolea:** How did that go?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Well, I was elected as our official union representative<br />
**Kolea:** Good choice.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So I have now assumed command of the Solidarity<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Where is he now?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** On the other hand, I had advocated that we redirect our efforts into using the production facilities we acquired from Jasanis to conduct medical research and produce much needed medical supplies for the needy<br />
**Dr. Malov:** But my preferred outcome was defeated by a 2/3 majority in the union election<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So what will be your specialty now?<br />
*Dr. Malov all of the Nausicaans pull out their distruptors and begin taking the phasers from Zox and his team*<br />
>all of the Nausicaans pull out their distruptors and begin taking the phasers from Zox and his team<br />

**Dr. Malov:** Unfortunately, the crew elected to begin a kidnapping business<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I am terribly sorry about that<br />

>INTERIOR - Solidarity Brig: Four Nausicaans shove the Lister officers into a brig which appears to be a converted torture room, and activate the forcefield locking the prisoners inside. The torture equipment has been removed from the cell and is haphazardly piled into a closet nearby. A small low-pile rug has been placed over the residue of a disintigrated body which has been burned into the deck, and a disruptor burn on the wall has been partially hidden by a motivational poster of a cat hanging from a branch taped over it.<br />

**Kolea:** You've got this Kitty!<br />
**Kolea:** Hey, when does Dr Malov get his conjugal visits?<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** The kitty represents the struggle of the oppressed working class<br />
*Nausicaan Brute activates the forcefield*<br />
**Kolea:** He can come any time.<br />
**Kolea:** I meant that multiple ways.<br />
*Nausicaan Brute is too stupid to understand the joke and stares blanky at Kolea*<br />

**Nausicaan Brute:** We are not "pirates" reptile, we have something called a "private parts charter" from the Cardassians<br />
**Kolea:** Ooh, I love those!<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** This is a legitimate union, enforcing Cardassian law in Cardassian space<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Impressive, but were you planning to flex your way through the forcefield?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The forcefield is just a metaphor for worker exploitation - ephemeral and illusory, yet confining.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Metaphorical interpretations notwithstanding, it still prevents us from escaping<br />
**Kolea:** I was expecting him to try and burst through it and cause it to short out from voltage overload because this style of forcefield will overcharge itself cause a feedback loop when it begins conducting through a Voth's above average acidic copper sulphate blood levels.<br />
**Kolea:** But by suggesting that, I'm probably going to cause some bingo cards to get scratched off.<br />

>A motivational union banner falls cinematically past him as he strikes a triumphant pose<br />

*Hailey Murry kicks the destroyed disrupter pistol to the side as she applauds politely*<br />
*Kolea goes to check on the Twins to see if they need medical assistance.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Thank you for concern nurse, but we are not seriously injured<br />
**Kolea:** Okay, then if you don't mind I'm going to make sure I'm out of the maximum wide beam setting on Murry's weapons with regards to your proximity.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps we should limit the counselor's access to weapons<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That wasn't even my fault, t he battery ruptured!<br />
**Kolea:** No, because if we don't give her normal weapons she uses her creativity to destroy entire decks of the Lister.<br />
>A small device on the Nausicaan's hip sparks, and shorts out from having been smashed so hard against the wall. As it starts to smoke, the doors pop open and the shuttle bay exit door unlocks<br />

**Kolea:** Time to GTFO, come on K'Tat.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** This is true, I believe Lt. Commander Viraseti is still somewhat cross about her quarters being vaporized<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I hope you understand, I didn't mean that bit about being a hero to the working class<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I hate the working class!<br />
*K'Tat Denellan follows Kolea out to the shuttle*<br />

Artificial gravity, and replicators are knocked offline. But the tiny shuttle caries on its way back towards Federation space<br />

**K'Tat Denellan:** Technically, you are all eligible for an arrest warrant<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, I think that might count as being coerced<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Malov didn't want to run afoul of the law, so the Solidarity applied for and recieved a Cardassian privateer charter<br />
**Kolea:** I have to admit, sex when artifical gravity is disabled is not nearly as exciting as it might sound.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Technically, by the letter of Cardassian law, they were operating legally under their charter to arrest you for violating Cardassian sovereign space<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is that why they arrested us?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ....okay.<br />
**Kolea:** Dr Malov is such a well prepared and intelligent union organizer.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Fine.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Now, if it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to be dropped at the nearest open port before you lot go back to your ship. Your federation is almost as bad as that... union<br />
*K'Tat Denellan shudders at the utterance of the word "union"*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What sort of deal is that?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** A little bit of information and that pays for your rescue, friend.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Fine, you want to know about Jasanis' accounts?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh yes. Very much so!<br />
*K'Tat Denellan pulls out a PADD and taps a few keys, then hands it over to Zox*<br />
*Zox puts on a pair of stately, clerical glasses and begins reviewing the acccounts we want info on.*<br />
*Zox thanks Kolea that he can actually see.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmmmmm<br />

Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 5]**<br />
*Zox carefully reviews the data K'tat is providing for authenticity.*<br />
**Kolea:** Who is the owner of the account everything was transferred to?<br />
*Kolea suspects K'Tat emptied all of Jasanis' accounts into one of his own after she was killed.*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** That would be Paletor, Jasanis paid off her debts and bought out her franchise<br />
**Kolea:** Hmm...<br />
*Kolea thinks to herself, "Why would a dead woman care whether her franchise was paid off or not?"*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And probably a front<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Even I don't know where her new accounts are, I just know that they are Nyberrite <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Very well, is there any place you prefer to be dropped off at?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Anywhere far from wherever you're going<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** With a spaceport<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I need to book passage back to Fenginar, explain to the FCA that I was forced to join the Union and did everything in my power to escape<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Before they discommend me for joining a union<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How would they know you joined a union?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Never underestimate the FCA<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, as I see it, you've paid for the rescue, but we might need a little bit more info to pay for extended travel<br />
**Kolea:** Ferengi can telepathically detect communism from a distance of 3 Light Years and the mere presence of it alters their DNA if they are subjected to membership of a union or a commune.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** What more do you want? I don't know where Jasanis is.<br />
**Kolea:** The Orions use it as a form of banishment torture on Ferengi who cross us.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** And good riddance, she shot me! And then ammended my health insurance policy not to cover my surgery!<br />
**Kolea:** A medical scan will show changes in K'Tat's brainwaves symptomatic of "close contact with anathema".<br />
*Kolea looks at K'Tat.*<br />
**Kolea:** You very specifically just did not refer to her in the past tense. Which means you know she is still alive, right?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Of course, I saw her leave for Kazor Klan myself<br />
**Kolea:** Thanks.<br />
*Kolea whispers, "Good luck out there, sister".*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I don't know what happened after that, but I wouldn't put my money on her dying <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hm<br />
**Kolea:** So who was distintegrated at the payoff?<br />
**Kolea:** After I reconfigured the changeling suit to replicate Jasansi.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Well Jasanis plays her cards pretty close to the vest, but I assume it was Brovena<br />
**Kolea:** Makes sense, fills in a few gaps. Thanks.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** You know<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Judging from this thing<br />
*Hailey Murry holds out the holdout pistol she got from Jasanis*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That might have just been a teleporter<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, this confirms a lot of suspicions.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We will drop you off at the closest neutral space port.<br />
**Kolea:** No, I'd guess she convinced Brovena to do the exchange somehow, and used the reconfigured changeling suit to cover her tracks.<br />
*K'Tat Denellan breathes a sigh of relief*<br />
**Kolea:** Dr Malov did say that Jasanis was being unnaturally pleasant after the left us on the planet and before the exchange we saw.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Clever move<br />
*Zox is appreciative that two people here can pick up on subtle emotions, rather than being reptiles.*<br />
**Kolea:** Given Jasanis, I wouldn't be surprised if neither of the people we saw in the video were responsible, but Jasanis ordering a hit on "herself" to give herself a clean getaway.<br />
**Kolea:** After all, I might have done the same thing in a previous life.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is a reasonable inference<br />

>Commander Bachar stands in the doorway, narrowing her eyes at Lt. Commanders Skig and Viraseti like a hungry Vulture in search of its next meal.

>A pair of security officers are holding Skig and Viraseti on opposite ends of the room. Skig has the remains of a plate of bolognaise smashed across her back, with the rest smeared into the carpet near her feet. Dr. Zerra is running dermal regenerator across an open contusion on Skig's appendix.

>On the other side of the room, Viraseti's uniform jacket has been stained by a carafe of Vodka Redbull, and she has taken it off and laid it over the back of a dining chair to dry. She is leaning against the wall and pressing an ice pack to her calcaneus.

>Commander Bachar steps through the doorway and into the room, stepping over the remnants of a destroyed pool table spread across the middle of the room.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** You two had better have a good explanation for this<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The stress of being in the proximity of her estranged husband, along with physical exercise caused Viraseit to have a lapse in judgement concerning whether it was appropriate to attack a superior officer or not.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have no idea what happened ma'am, I was just completely overcome with rage. Nothing like it has ever happened before ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Totally understandable, I think we can let this go as a stress event.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** And what about you Lt. Commander? What are you doing having candlelit dinners with a civilian in the middle of responding to an emergency situation?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Unless the rolls were really jacked up, Skig would have flattened Viraseti if we rolled for this.</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Candlelit?<br />
*Skig looks at the remains of the table.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** The facility's life support system is failing and poisoning dozens of people, and you are in here drinking... whatever this disgusting liquid is on Viraseti's coat<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh yes, that was suggested as a power conservation mechanism as there is a flux power shortage in the life support system.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes yes.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suppose I should go take a look at that. Have you tried the Tribble Souffle?<br />
*Skig offers Bachar a Tribble Kebob.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan accidentally made about a thousand of these earlier.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It may not be their fault, I'm reading some extreme fluctuations in their neuro-transmitter levels<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh?<br />
*Gra'lan is proud of his 'accident'. Tribbles are more cost efficient at fault detection than electrical equipment.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Far beyond the normal variation for Humans or Tellarites<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That does explain my strange desire to engage in Karaoke. I guess that wll go on the Blooper Reel instead of being in the episode, as I'm sure the Dr will fix this before it gets out of hand.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Tellerite*</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** In fact, I'm reading the same neurotranmitter fluctuations in the entire away team<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Have any of you experienced any other symptoms?<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks to Gra'lan and Oakadan*<br />
**Gra'lan:** No Sir. Steady as always.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, to be fair, I tried to actually pay attention to some personal matter Viraseti was having and even sat down and drank coffee with her.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Well that is a very troubling symptom<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That should have been an indication there were serious problems with the atmospheric controls.<br />
**Oakadan:** Hmmmm... I did have a few moments of protective concern when Lt Virasetti and I were out gathering data which struck me as unusual, but nothing so extreme as to act on it. <br />
**Gra'lan:** Perhaps we should contact security and see if random tussles have been increasing in frequency?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'll need to consult the medical database, see what could be the cause<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Much like addiction Oakadan, it builds gradually over time.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Good thinking ensign<br />
*Skig looks at Dr Zerra.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Apologies, Junior Lieutenant<br />
**Gra'lan:** No need to apologize Commander.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good thing we are visiting a completely functional colony of scientists with a well-stocked medical bay and access to Starfleet records so we can easily identify the problem.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Now let's get these hot-bloods something that will make 'em a lil more peaceful no?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Dr. Zerra can worry about that<br />

In the confusion, they lose their footing and fall on the slippery, steep cave floor.

**Luatoria Dural:** I'd certainly feel much safer knowing he is keeping a... close eye on me<br />
**Oakadan:** Do we have any other Betazed women on site as well?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, I am quite certain his duties as a dashing and handsome Starfleet Officer in a fetching uniform require it.<br />

**Luatoria Dural:** But this is such a scary place with all this medical equipment, I need a strong, authoratitive, older man to keep me safe<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** Or I can go with him<br />
**Oakadan:** Also, tribbles produce a hormone at the end of their reproductive cycle. If we can produce this, we can halt the tribbles' cycle and disperse them. <br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, Oakadan, that sounds great.<br />

**Throk:** Throk determine stupid bird in Medical Bay in need of immediate ingestion.<br />
*Throk gets out high-powered cooking stun taser.*<br />
**Throk:** This turn stupid bird into boiled tastiness in 10 seconds.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oooook<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Very useful<br />
**Throk:** Throk think this much less likely to cause Skig to be angry by using disruptor rifle to cook beetles near ship exterior hull like last time.<br />
*Throk offers Lt Malat what looks like a 2 kg, partially melted Daktarian Plated Beetle coated in a light garllic batter.*<br />
**Geret:** I haven't found anything interesting out. unfortunately.<br />
*Throk pats Geret on the head.*<br />
**Throk:** It okay, later you help me find bird and we can cook and eat together in bonding ritual of Glue-trions.<br />
**T'kor:** I found a small device attached to Skig's computer. It's too advanced to be replicated, and it has no obvious markings that commercial products usually have. By my estimation, only four people on the ship have the proficiency to produce it. <br />
**Geret:** But there is another Elaysian man that looks very much like Dr. Zerra. He never spoke of a brother?<br />
**T'kor:** Myself, of course. Skig. Zox. And the Twins<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** His file indicates a brother<br />
**Throk:** Curious. Throk discover that commands to control Zox suit not come from main terminal but from direct interface to transmitter or override.<br />
**Throk:** Throk also pick up copies of Zox's medical implant, but they not very plant like, so Throk not understand, but looks complex.<br />
*Throk hands complex schematics to T'Kor to compare to the transmitter.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk wonder if transmitter share similarity to implant thing and made by same people?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I did some digging in Starfleet records, tried to get my hands on some details about their service records. I am pretty sure that Dr. Zerra helped create the Morphopage bioweapon that Section 13 used during the war<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So... I can't prove it, but even if he isn't involved I am pretty sure he is a war criminal.<br />

**Geret:** It just seems so odd Lt. Zerra seemed to be researching entirely mundane Caulobacter now. Very boring?<br />
**Throk:** For instance, during Dominion War, Throk determine that Klingon, Romulan, Jem'Hadar, Humans, Breen, Cardassians, and Bajorans all taste like chicken.<br />
**Geret:** I was expecting something devilish!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Is Caulobacter some other virus?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That affects humanoids?<br />
*Geret wonders which side Throk was really on....*<br />

**Geret:** Why is everything in computers and diagrams today!<br />
**T'kor:** Okay so it looks like Zerra got the regulator and control circuits from off-board. There's no work order to manufacture them<br />
**Throk:** Caulobacter is a dangerous brachial virus that Dr Zerra has been doing research on and looking into viral pathgens across a broad spectrum of species and are quite invasive into ecosystems where few antivirual inhibitors can prevent their spread through contract, in addition to a long hibernation period which can see them resurface decades later and infect an entirely new generation of creatures. However, Gorn mostly immune, primary issue for me is they make PADDs and other small electronics taste horrible.<br />
**Geret:** pretty sus!<br />
**T'kor:** Would that be something which would be useful against tribbles?<br />
*Throk pulls a chunk of a PADD from between his teeth.*<br />
**Throk:** See, this taste nothing like chicken.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wait, is this Caulobacter a virus or a bacteria? Also: does it matter? Also: what is the difference between a virus and a bacteria? I'm not a scientist<br />
**Geret:** The notes say bacteria.<br />
**Throk:** Bacteria are relatively complex, single-celled creatures, many with a rigid wall, and a thin, rubbery membrane surrounding the fluid inside the cell. They can reproduce on their own. Fossilized records show that bacteria have existed for about 3.5 billion years, and bacteria can survive in different environments, including extreme heat and cold, radioactive waste, and the human body.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Throke said... wait, why do I care what Throk said<br />
**Throk:** Viruses are tinier: the largest of them are smaller than the smallest bacteria. All they have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. In most cases, they reprogram the cells to make new viruses until the cells burst and die. In other cases, they turn normal cells into malignant or cancerous cells.

Also unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack. For example, certain viruses attack cells in the liver, respiratory system, or blood. In some cases, viruses target bacteria.<br />
**Geret:** Throk has started reading! Ya Throk!<br />
*Throk takes glasses off nose, opens ketchup packet and spreads it on glasses, chews them up.*<br />
**Throk:** Polycarbonate goes well with tomatoes.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There must be something we are overlooking<br />
**Geret:** Surely.<br />
*Throk stands above Malat and peers down at Geret.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk overlook Malat at Geret, that help?<br />
**Geret:** After all, it's possible Zerra asked for parts from the Twins<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What do we know for sure: somehow, one of them is passing information off the ship without it being detected<br />
**Throk:** Seem plausible he would ask for help from Twins, as they are on board ship.<br />
**T'kor:** It's possible, but if Zerra asked the Twins for parts then there would have been a work order for them<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not necessarily, you think the Twins can't modify computer records?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think the computer will say anything they don't want it to say<br />
**T'kor:** Oh, true. Whoever might have done it would have the know-how to adjust that.<br />
**Throk:** Nonsense!<br />
**T'kor:** Let's see here...<br />
**Throk:** Computer, state the Twins are poopy pants.<br />
**Computer Voice:** Unable<br />
**Geret:** Well, the best thing we have going for us is, most people assume we are total misfits. Perhaps we should create false information that only gets to either the twins or zerra, and see which false information our enemies seem to have access to.<br />
**Throk:** Hmm...<br />
**Throk:** Small angry woman might be right.<br />
**Throk:** I like Geret's idea.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That's not a bad idea, but how do we know what information they have access to?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think we need a concrete plan, or some hard evidence to take to Bachar<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So far, everything we find could implicate both the Twins and Zerra<br />
**T'kor:** Or even just one of the Twins<br />
**T'kor:** What did you find when you searched Zerra's office?<br />
**Throk:** I found stupid bird that needs to be eaten.<br />
**Throk:** Not sure why Zerra is keeping bird in office.<br />

>Thankfully, by the time Dr. Gallego lunged at Dr. Zerra, the away team had made it back to Lister, and Commander Bachar sent Zox and Murry down to get a handle on the situation. The implacable security officer has a firm grip on Dr. Gallego, who is clutching a throbbing wound on his forhead. Brood running down his face from a laceration over his eye. Zox is apparently unbothered by the wreckage of a computer terminal wrapped around his shins. Lt. Commander Skig and Hailey Murry have pulled Lt. Commander Viraseti into the hall, where she is rubbing her elbow gingerly and wiping blood out of her hair. Dr. Zerra is nearby, preparing an analgesic in his hypospray for the large bruise on his kidneys.<br />

>Commander Bachar is standing in the hall with her face buried in her hands, mumbling to herself. Suddenly, she raises her head, regains her composure and comes over to her senior officers.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Viraseti, this is the third physical altercation you have been involved in down here in the past 2 days. I would expect this from Lt. Malat or Zox, but not from you.... Either way, we have a situation to deal with here and your personal entanglements are getting in the way of that. Whatever is going on with these Tribbles, I am sure we stand a better chance of getting to the bottom of it if our chief science officer and the closest thing we have to a Tribble expert aren't at each other's throats.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I am ordering you to get counseling with Murry. I can't order Dr. Gallego to participate, but I CAN order Zox to lock him in the brig and charge him with assaulting a Starfleet officer if he refuses. Murry, you're in charge here until such time as you're satisfied that these two can at least work together on this problem without any more bloodshed.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes ma'am<br />
*Zox mentally debates the value of the ships counselor, and if that would just give him the edge next fight rather than avoid conflict.*<br />
*Skig notes that she is no longer in charge, and this makes her happy.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oof, and left you with your daughter? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** This place was too close to the front lines, too dangerous for a child to live here during the war<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And obviously she couldn't live on an active duty starship during wartime<br />

*Throk chews on the remains of what looks like a small dog femur.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Alright, I came up empty reviewing comms in and out. No sign of however Zerra or the Twins might be getting messages out to their accomplices<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** The only messages Zerra has sent are research notes with his research collaborators, and the twins have never sent or received a single message<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No friends, family, anything.<br />
**Throk:** Throk question if Bynars have ability to communicate via other means through neural empathy. Much like situation where 400 Vulcans fall over dead at once and Spock has an Alderaan moment.<br />
**Throk:** Throk also think that is wrong, Malat.<br />
**Throk:** Twins received message that led to strange Casino Heist situation from "friend".<br />
**Geret:** The twins make me dizzy, as understanding memory addresses is confusing to me and I can't think in hexidecimal.<br />
*Throk offers Malat what looks like some grilled dog meat from a dog approximately the size of the one the Twins might have cared for.*<br />
**Geret:** If math is their language, they have subtle ways to messaging other than direct communication.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think it easy to think in hexadecimal, just take off left boot and can count to sixteen using right boot as big-endian value for variable calculations.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No matter what they can do, the comm system logs message recipients and senders and the Twins have never had either as long as they've been aboard the Lister<br />
**Throk:** Throk keep right hand, left hand, and left foot of Nausicaan just to help with hexidecimal math.<br />
**Throk:** Gorn not have right digits, we use base 8 math.<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps we saw one in half and count rings? Works for determining age of arboreal creatures.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think we need to do that<br />
**T'kor:** How often do they leave the ship?<br />
*Throk wishes someone had caught on and made the cool phone tree pun.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No more than a typical crewmember. They take shore leave when available, and they are often on away missions<br />
**T'kor:** Which would make it plenty of opportunities to send information out, including recently? <br />
**T'kor:** Can we do a scan of their systems down below, see if any messages have been sent? Within network or without?<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps you are thinking too technical. Starfleet ships have mail room right? I don't mean men's restoom.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It wouldn't matter how they sent the messages, the comms transmitter has to encode everything that goes through it into subspace data packets<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If they sent anything via subspace it would be logged<br />
**Throk:** Sending encoded messages via physical means has been a thing since Voth inhabited Earth, in Throk's stupid opinion.<br />
**Throk:** Also, anyone have mustard?<br />
**T'kor:** It does, but it doesn't have to use *our* comms transmitter, does it? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That's a good point, there are ways to send messages that don't involve the comms system<br />
**Throk:** Right, sometimes Gra'lan get drunk and point naked buttocks out ship window and say he sending moonbeams. Throk remind hm space is cold.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Starships are pretty electromagnetically leaky, if you are creative about it there are a lot of EM waves going out all the time<br />
*Geret Here, I stole condiment packets from the replicator, have some mustard.*<br />
**Geret:** Here, I stole condiment packets from the replicator, have some mustard.<br />
**Throk:** Gorn spy in Klingon space once use entire range of dental hygiene equipment on Klingon battlecruiser to re-transmit their battle plans as dental drill noises.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think that would be a very effective way to send secret messages<br />
*Throk eats the mustard packets, without opening them.*<br />
**Throk:** Nonsense, no one want to listen to dental drill noises.<br />
**Throk:** Perfect way to send encrypted messages.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we do go through with T'Kor and Geret's plan of leaking them false information, we will need to figure out if they are passing that on <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** They don't seem to be using the comms system, so how do we monitor them?<br />
**Geret:** Well, in either the Twins or Zerra, what they are looking for is a way to start a war. Can't we just give them coordinates for a fleet, use some well made decoys, and see which false fleet gets blown up?<br />
**Geret:** We don't need to know _how_, just a who.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think should place audio and EM recording systems in their rooms. Whichever one gathers no information is likely the prime suspect.<br />
**T'kor:** We've got a number of sensors on board that track those EMF details for other purposes. I'll see if I can look into this. <br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But you can't necessarily know that they will go attack that fleet, or how long it would take<br />
**Geret:** I suppose there are more details to work out yes<br />
**Throk:** Why not just relay information for another cache of Jem'Hadar Pulse Weapons?<br />
**Throk:** Then see which cache gets dug up?<br />
**T'kor:  [Total: 4] [Effects: 1] [4dChallenge = 4]**<br />
**Geret:** Yes that! Juice it up and make sure they can't resist!<br />
**Throk:** Throk throw in recipe for chili con carne, most villains cannot resist.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But do we know that they would be interested in that?<br />
**Throk:** People who wish to start wars always want more guns.<br />
**Throk:** I doubt offering them salacious lizard pr0n would be as enticing as large phallic shaped weapon of doom.<br />
*Throk goes to Malat's replicator and has it create a large vat of Dog-Cat-and-Kitchen-Sink stew, with extra side of rodent.*<br />
**Throk:** Thinking make Throk hungry. Anyone want some?<br />
**Geret:** Have a few good baits. Also have a false message that Commander Bachar is taking a luxury-space cruise in some impossible backwater systems.<br />
**T'kor:** Thank you, but no. <br />
*Throk looks at Malat as he chews on half a cat.*<br />
*Geret decides to look a little more monstrous and eat vermin as well.*<br />
**Throk:** Do you question why they would want Chili Con Carne recipe? Chili Con Carne is irresistable.<br />
**Geret:** I think they can get all the Chili they want though.<br />
*Throk pushes buttons to make some on replicator, mis-types and ends up with "Chili Con Carney" and gets a rabbit stuffed with Wendy's Chili.*<br />
**Geret:** They are not rational.<br />
**Geret:** A few varied baits, carefully distributed.<br />
**Throk:** Rational thinking is like sanity. It is one trick pony. You only have rational option. As soon as you dip into insanity and irrationality, then there is no limit. Much like square root of negative one makes computer do strange things when you apply to type 2 phaser armory.<br />
**Throk:** We must think like Zox to overcome evil villains. Zox never let sanity or reason interfere with his plans.<br />
**Geret:** Hrm....<br />
**T'kor:  [Total: 2] [Effects: 0] [dChallenge = 2]**<br />
**Geret:** It's also unfair that the two people we think are the sneaks are hard to read.<br />
**T'kor:** Hmmm, it doesn't look like they used any non-comms EM signatures. Nothing like hidden messages around the time that Bachar was kidnapped, and that was an incident that Jasanis would have to have known about<br />
**Geret:** But Dr. Zerra could be using coded messages in his medical research, and the twins could be sending coded messages just in the way they create the ships logs and deflector calibrations.<br />
**Geret:** Smart doesn't need to be super exotic.<br />
**Throk:** Throk not smart, nor super exotic.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** True, the Dr does send a lot of research notes with his collaborators, and the Twins are the ops officer, they are responsible for the management of the navigation system<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And yeah, ships logs are sent to starfleet command on an automated schedule<br />
**Throk:** Navigation beacons have very long range and are mostly benign and ignored.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And the Twins are wizards with computer files, so who know what they could do there<br />
**Geret:** I appreciate your expertise T'kor, but perhaps it can't be found via engineering.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It would be easier if Zox or Throk were the spy, fewer ways they could be concealing messages<br />
*Geret blushes.*<br />
**Geret:** I don't think Zox conceals much of anything.<br />
**Throk:** For instance, if you adjust frequencly of Starfleet Navgation Band-A to harmonize at same frequency as Klingon Opera named "Bastard Cancerous Lumps that will kill me before combat" then Romulan Listening Post on border goes into reactor overload.<br />
**Throk:** Gorn teenagers do this as prank.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well that is... certainly colorful, but I take the point that navigational deflectors put out a lot of subspace energy<br />
**T'kor:** How do Gorn teenagers have access to Starfeet Navigation Band-A? <br />
**Throk:** Throk make point?<br />
**Throk:** Throk happy!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I need to see Dr. Zerra when this is done and get a brain scan, I am starting to respect Throk....<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I must have hit my head<br />
**Geret:** Throk hides nothing, everyting is in the replicator logs.<br />
**Throk:** Starfleet Navigation Band-A operate at same frequency as Gorn Radio stations, not so much access as ability to replicate signals. Not like Gorn give crap about Starfleet Communication Commission assigned frequency ranges.<br />

**T'kor:** Well, not everything, some of the parts here were hand-made with considerable precision<br />
*Geret looks at Throk's replication history and presumably sees a detailed list of the galaxy's pests and small delicious animals.*<br />
**Throk:** Also, if Throk was going to coordinate mass conspiracy with hundreds of officers who all gathered for stupid reason of deflecting gamma radiation instead of using it to cook delicious meal, using subspace navigational relays would be good way to multicast to interested neighbors.<br />
**Geret:** Yeah, but can we pinpoint that to either one of them, without the other one being just a tag-along?<br />
**Geret:** Zerra could have just gotten parts fromt the twins or the other way around<br />
**Throk:** Right, back to idea of planting information and see who acts on it.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Agreed, that seems more actionable<br />
**Throk:** Throk like idea of using plants to catch spies. Plants needed for proper fiber and digestion of spies.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We just need to slip them some juicy info, and monitor the vectors we suspect they are using to communicate<br />
*Throk replicates a large kelp that could be used as a Bynar sized nori-roll.*<br />

**T'kor:** Two different pieces of bait would let us see which of them is acting on it<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Agreed<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What do you have in mind?<br />
**Geret:** "Commander Bachar's Location" and 'Secret Jem'Hadar Weapons"<br />
**T'kor:** They already know Commander Bachar's Location though<br />
**T'kor:** And I do not think they need that further, do they?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And they already got a bunch of secret Jem'Hadar weapons<br />
**Geret:** 'Secret Ketracel Production Method' 'High value target that would be good to get starfleet angery'<br />
**T'kor:** Their plan for the weapons is to have them be found, isn't it?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe, we don't actually really know<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It isn't like a bunch of Starfleet officers can stage a false flag attack using Jem'Hadar particle weapons and have people believe it was Jem'Hadar<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And same thing if you fitted Jem'Hadar particle cannons to a Starfleet ship, it's not like people can't tell the difference between a Jem'Hadar ship and a Starfleet one<br />
**Geret:** wait isn't it _exactly_ like that?<br />
**Geret:** Oh snap, what about a distressed spy ship that needs help deep? that seems like a juicy follow up<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If a bunch of humans and Andorians started shooting a place up with Jem'Hadar weapons, people wouldn't be blinded to the fact they are human and andorian just because of the weapons<br />
**Geret:** hrm,...<br />
**Throk:** Option 1) Renegade Jem'Hadar Colony seeks entry into Federation // Option 2) Founders Lithophage sample with memtic encoding that could be used for morphogenic research ... Those Throk best ideas.<br />
**Geret:** Those are both great!<br />
**Throk:** Throk steal them from back of Cracker Jack box.<br />
*Throk offers Geret empty box of Cracker Jacks candy.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk incapable of higher thinking, Throk specialize in insanity as desire to become chief chef and security officer, like esteemed Zox.<br />
*Geret checks to see if the prize is still in the box or if Throk ate it.*<br />

**Geret:** T'kor can go to the twins for technical help and leave something there<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ok, I guess someone is getting injured by Throk in a holodeck accident so they have an excuse to go to sickbay<br />
**Geret:** What if Throkk accidentally eats something bad, like broccoli or brussel sprouts?<br />
**Geret:** That's a trip to the doctor!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It might make them suspicious, Throk eats everything he sees and has never been sick from it<br />
**Throk:** We could just give it to Zox and within a couple hours he will end up in sick bay from injury.<br />
**Geret:** It's not a bad plan<br />
**Geret:** but surely Zox will notice it<br />
**Throk:** I don't think so, Zox not notice mulitple tracking beacons for many episodes.<br />
**Geret:** Okay, what if we hide it in the potted plant?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I can just take the hit, it won't be the first time I end up in sickbay from a training accident<br />
**Geret:** so we plant it in the plant, and it's a plant.<br />
**Geret:** Okay, sure.<br />
**Geret:** Well this works just fine then!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But you will have to figure out how to slip something to the twins and monitor them and Zerra to see who is passing it on<br />
**Throk:** Malat could avoid injury by just going to sick bay for extra alcohol after being subjected to Murry Counseling session, like 2/3 of crew.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Throk, you're with me. We've got an injury to fake.<br />

>INTERIOR - Orlana Corridors: As a seemingly endless number of Tribbles pour out of every vent, light fixture, access panel, and ODN junction: Commander Bachar leads the away team at a brisk pace away from the staff quarters and back towards the labs to deal with the situation before it gets any worse.<br />

>Skig and Murry are able to keep up without any issue, but Zox, Viraset and Dr. Gallego are struggling to put their clothes back on while trying to follow the increasingly unamused executive officer. At least it is easier to pull your pants on when your legs are greased up in baby oil.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Viraseti, you and your husband had better have something useful to suggest.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** While we were practicing the reverse Plek'ta maneuver with Zox, I was thinking back to when we were younger. 20 years ago, rubbing our bodies together like this would enflame our passions and ignite our lust and... well, nevermind. You get the picture.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But now, nothing at all. The flame of passion has long been extinguished. It gave me an idea: Camilo said the Tribble reproduction is mediated by a hormone they produce, the flame of their passion if you will. What we need to do is douse it. Commander Zox and I may be able to design a chemical weapon that can flood their hormone receptors and prevent any further uptake, thereby interrupting their mating cycle. If we are lucky, it won't even be dangerously toxic to humanoids.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Like Lisa, I aslo found my mind wandering during our workout. I too recalled our salad days of unbridled passion in our youth, and how the ravages of time have ruined our once young and supple bodies. It got me thinking about how Lisa was once young and fertile, but is no longer. That is when I realized that fertility is the key to our predicament.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Tribbles are highly unusual among macroscopic animal species, reproducing asexually and introducing genetic diversity into their population through horizontal gene transfer. This unusual mechanism means that they will be susceptible to the introduction of harmful genes during reproduction. We don't want to kill off the population, but if we can introduce a gene that will reduce their level of fertility, it should allow the population to stabilize before further damage is done.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** "No longer young and fertile" huh? As if you're still a young, strapping specimen. Maybe you can stop them mating by giving them Tribble erectile disfunction. <br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Or perhaps you can get them to fight amongst themselves by triggering their delicate sense of self worth.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Your emotional state is as unstable has a thin shell of rock covering a roiling caldera of magma. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Enough, both of you, please<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And you are as petty and selfish as a child, but actually that isn't a bad idea. The facility is built with geo-thermal power<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The cave system where the tribbles are congregating is a series of old magma tubes over a now-dormant caldera. But just a few hundred meters under the surface are tens of thousands of tons of molten rock. If we equip Zox and T'Kor with a laser mining rig, and then retreat to a safe distance, they should be able to deal with the tribble problem in no time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I like ALL of these solutions!<br />
*Zox leaves grease stains on every panel he comes into contact with. *<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Perhaps you can drive the tribbles away by condescendingly belittling their life's work and career.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We can try. Maybe you can get rid of them by taking a new job in another sector and leaving.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Ok, that's enough of that<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This is a golden opportunity for both of you, to become the biologist-alpha for saving the planet of ecological treasures, and the science officer-alpha of your tribe for clearing the ship.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Time to act like professionals. What's the play here? We need to make a call quickly<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Assign us Commander. One team for Team Lava, one team for Gene Engineering and one team for De-horny Chemical team?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think the hormone or genetic approaches would be best, ideally we can come up with something that can be used without enormous amounts of collateral damage<br />
**Gra'lan:** I think Gra'lan has submitted some research in these areas as well<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I don't think we should divide our focus Zox, we have limited time. We need all-hands on deck to stop the runaway breeding<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Squigg Tribble Hybrids. XD</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** While both the hormone suppression or genetic modification offer a non-engineering solution, I think the hormone suppression is a safer solution.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And we can leave the lava as plan B<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The genetic modification prompts too much risk for an immediate fix. I would propsoe an immediate hormone suppression therapy and then a more controlled and studied approach to the long term genetic fix.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I am somewhat opposed to the idea of the lava-tube with Zox because it places my lovingly crafted Zox Exo-suit in danger.<br />

>They don't come over to join the other officers though, they instead head to a small 2-top table in the corner with a couple of champaign flutes<br />

**Kolea:** Those two look quite happy now that Viraseti is single and they can freely shag each other without pesky laws calling it "adultery".<br />
*Zox looks at the now putative couple and wonders how effective naked wrestling really was. Gah, mammals, ya know?*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** yeah, I can't believe I had no idea they were a thing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I guess it makes sense.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I didn't even know Viraseti was married<br />
*Kolea shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's hard to tell sometimes when there's distance between active work and their personal life<br />
*Geret appears to dig the formal dress and classy event.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk just happy he was allowed to eat all the BBQ Triibble he could at the Research Station Buffet before we left orbit.<br />
**Throk:** Throk slightly sad Skig not allow any Tribbles on the ship.<br />
*Zox passes Throk some Pepto and anti-acids.*<br />
*Throk etas them, bottle, labels, and caps.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I am not sure you should be eating the tribbles, what if you accidentally eat still-viable Tribble eggs or something<br />
**Throk:** They crunchy but good.<br />
