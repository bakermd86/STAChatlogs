>Captains Log, Stardate 62133.7: Our resupply mission to Lasos III was uneventful, but before we set course for the stellar survey in the Omanite Reach, Lt. Commander Malat has asked me to assemble the senior staff for a briefing. She was a little vague as to why.<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: The senior staff assembles around the briefing table as Malat nervously checks the contents of a PADD.<br />

*Hailey Murry leans over to see if she can catch a glimpse*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Surely, no challenge should intimidate our intrepid and youthful Lt. Cmdr? What could be so concerning?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well if you'll recall, a few weeks ago we identified the warp signature of the vessel we encountered around the black hole where we rescued those Jem'Hadar fighters<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Since then, I developed and have been running a tracking program on the Lister's computer core. Using warp monitoring and surveillance data from listening posts along the border region, I am using a interferometric algorithm to reconstruct the path of that warp signature from the background warp field fluctuations<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Good work<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The computer's ETA for the program completing indicated it should have been done right around now, but the progress bar has stalled at 99%<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I hate when that happens<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Skig, permission to go kick the computer core<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I don't really think that would help, I don't think the computer core will respond to violence or threats of violence. Normally computers pretty much just do what they are programmed to do, and at most you can break them with external force. It's probably not going to make it go any faster<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** There are a few aspects of the Lister that I think do work better with percussive maintenance, but our computer core is not one of them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I suggest consulting with Gralan to learn the correct form of violence, and how best to apply it. <br />
>Suddenly, Malat's PADD chimes and she quickly taps a few controls to pull up a map of the sector on the monitor.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Finally, let's see what we've got on the CDS Roral....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Finally, let's see what we've got on the CDS Roral....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Permission to kick the computer core denied. Just defer the update until after your process completed. I set the update for Life Support systems to be Nice -15 instead of Nice 19, I guess this was needed so the filtering system stopped caused Decks 12-16 to smell like rotting vegetation.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Life Support updates are important, and I have been neglecting them for a while, but I somewhat realized that maybe that is not in the best interest of the crew.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Oh, which reminds me, AOL is turning off their dial-up service, so I need to have Gra'lan take care of the redshirts quarters if they are going to try and stream videos again.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Malat this is a wonderful piece of news and excellent research you have brought us. I would expect nothing less from a Star Fleet officer with a chance to redo her last 20 years of service.<br />
*Skig is still trying to figure out this "leadership" thing.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Best deduction I have ever seen. A shame I can't tell the difference between the red and green lines. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I think Starfleet grey market procurement gets all the abestos insulation needed for the Lister's hangar bay from Koralis. We could probably use that as an excuse to visit there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** But do we want to visit Koralis or snoop the Nebula?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Which reminds me, I need to see if T'kor remembered NOT to assign a group of Redshirts to strip the abestos off the cooling pipes without PPE. I keep people told that is bad.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Err.. people keep telling me that is bad.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** The McAllister nebula is 150 light years across, and the ionic interference will limit sensor range. If you want to investigate it, you're going to need a pretty good idea of where to go<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The problem with a nebula would be... we are searching for a needle in a proverbial haystack.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Or, more specifically, what Viraseti said.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Great minds think alike ma'am<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Great minds think alike ma'am<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Is this an ongoing scan? Will we know if they head back toward that nebula?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Right, but we won't get much out of Koralis - such a hub of trade isn't going to have to observe, with all the hussle and bussle day by day<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I can leave the progam running, but it is based on weekly sensor reports from the Starfleet Intelligence<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** So it won't be up-to-the-minute<br />
*Ensign Ghex raises her hand*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Ghex?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well, um... I hope I'm not interrupting, but you know whether we wanted to check out the nebula or the Koralis system we just need to make sure we have a way to isolate and track the ion trail or residual warp signature of the Roral. When I was at the academy, I got full marks on long-term starship tracking operations when we practiced ion trail tracking and warp field reconstruction in the Proxima Centauri system. My instructor said I was a natural.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Fantastic! What would you need to get that sort of read?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** How long has it been since the last time the Roral was in the nebula? If we are looking at an ion trail that is 30 days old in a shifting nebula field, that might make it a little more challenging than the well-charted Proxima Centauri system.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Looks like they were last in the nebula around 8 weeks ago, last time they were in Koralis was 2 weeks ago<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Despite Ensign Ghex's enthusiasm, I agree that tracking an 8-week old ion trail in a nebula would be a challenge. Koralis would certainly be easier.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** You brought Borg parts on board?!?!?! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yep.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** And you didn't think you should tell me?<br />

*Skig covers Ghex's eyes with her hand.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Skig, find a way to secure that thing safely. And if it can't be safely secured, then put it into an empty photon torpedo casing and fire it into a star<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I wonder if the McAllister Nebula is where they're storing their little secret fleet of Jem Hadar ships?<br />

*Hailey Murry would tell Ghex that she doesn't have to raise her hand, but given how much she talks that might actually be an issue. *<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, isn't the McAllister nebula deep inside Cardassian space? I am not an expert, but wouldn't it be like... super illegal for us to go there? And wouldn't the Cardassians shoot us? I've never been deep into Cardassian space before, we didn't cover unauthorized incursions into the sovereign territory of hostile alien powers at the academy, but it seems like it would be dangerous and possibly get us all court martialed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** True<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** We've violated Cardassian space like... four times in the past 2 years<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** If they do, it would be highly illegal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The armistice agreement stricly forbids sale of any salvaged Dominion material, it is all supposed to be returned to the Gamma quadrant. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Windbloom, do you know and merchants of ill-repute that would be willing to sell a little info?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** They have a thriving salvage and black market environment. The very environmentally unfriendly parts of the Lister get refits from there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I know some merchants who would be silling to sell us a little weed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I have never tried to buy info before<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** But I can ask<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** For instance, the nuclear fission standby reactor from the Russian Tuplelov class submarine that is in Old Faithless requires U-238.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Which reminds me, when we are there I need a cross-torx mylar coated tympanic hammer.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Oh, and 400 gallons of raw petroleum.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Can such an archaic reactor actually put out enough power for a shuttle, or is it just for radio and life support?<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Why do you need so much patroleum? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I'm pretty sure it's just there to fatally irradiate anyone that rides in the damn thing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Umm...a better question might be, why do we need it in an archaic non-metric unit?<br />
*Windbloom Openheart steps out of the briefing room for a few minutes before returning.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm pretty certain that reactor is capable of reaching sub jigawatts at 110% capacity, which should be more than enough to get it out any atmosphere that has an escape velocity of 11m/s.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I mean, no one will have hair and likely have bulbous tumours, but the ship will survive.<br />
*Skig thinks for a second.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Do we have a chance of developing super strength or x-ray vision?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm...I think this explains a couple things in engineering I need to look into.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Umm... oh absolutely.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** You might even develop ninja skills and a half-shell, plus an urge to eat pizza regularly based on the last time we tested the reactor on a redshirt.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Ok, I talked to my guy. Told him I needed to find a place that has some salvaged Jem'Hadar ships so I can find some KW tubes. He told me that there's a junkyard in Koralis called "Crazy Kolaakor's" that was rumored to have some dominion war salvage <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It may be better to avoid that for now, but we cana put that as plan B<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, just for the record I would vote that we should not be irradiated<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** That fills me with confidence, Windbloom<br />

>INTERIOR - Crazy Kolaakor's Salvage: The away team beams over to the office of Crazy Kolaakor's. The room is full of a chaotic mess of components and tools, stacked floor to ceiling. In the corner, an aquatic-looking alien is cleaning a pile of old Klingon disruptor rifles while listening to some kind of music which sounds like a dying whale to your ears.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** It's a junkyard, I don't have stock. I scan your ship before you go into the stacks, and when you leave. I charge you based on the mass and composition of materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Smart.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** 2 bars of latinum per ton for raw materials like Tritanium, computer cores and weapons systems are charged on a per-unit basis, refined products like ODN lines and EPS conduit are 5 bars / ton<br />

<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** All sales are final, if you leave the stacks with it you pay for it<br />

<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I heard that you had some salvaged Jem'Hadar ships, my tubes are starting to wear out and they're hard to find replacements<br />

<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** You're shit outta luck. Some Cardassians cleaned me out a few months ago, both of the Jem'Hadar fighters I had on-hand <br />
<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** You might be able to find something in the stacks if you've got good sensors, but I don't got no more Jem'Hadar ships<br />

<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** Well, sometimes they leave dead. That is not a gaurantee that there ain't no dead bodies in these ships<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** If they bought the fighters, no problem for us. We were looking for the medical and biological systems. I'm pretty sure a scrap yard like this has pulled a few of those off the larger ships. Any chance you could point us in the direction of some of the less intact ships. Or the ones with organics in them?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/guy1.png" alt=""Crazy" Kolaakor" width="50" height="50">**"Crazy" Kolaakor** I don't keep an inventory, you gotta search the stacks yourselves<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm picking up the energy signature of a high explosive device. It seems like it may be a mine<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It's a few dozen kilometers away, but it looks like it's pretty big<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** There's a 23rd century cardassian medical ship right next to it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** You want to go check it out? Or keep our distance?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** It's not, but what if we _pull_ it away, rather than push it away. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** There is still a chance we'd set it off<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Pushing on it would be foolish. But pulling on it, it may just think it's solar winds<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That ship is the same vintage as the Lister, so if the mine is much newer, it is safe to assume it was left here as a gift.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Should we let him know that there's an active mine in here?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, I was using the word "gift" sarcastically. Captain Kaglor included it as an example of better communication in this book of "kommand secrets" he left me to read.<br />

I did very well at mine avoidance though. I think I was helped by my natural sense of self preservation and desire not to be blown into tiny pieces and spread across the vacuum of space<br />
