<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Understood, let's talk to Captain Kaglor about this and see if we can get them to stop attacking ships<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Your crewmembers in Engineering pair very well with Antarian wine and ranch dressing.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Then we can investigate their communications<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Captain Kaglor enters the room escorted by 2 red shirts. Bachar and the senior staff are gathered around the table where they have placed a large crate of electrical insulating mats.<br />

*Zox is just the friendly neighborhood dinosaur, OwO.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Captain, did President Yum... dammit Throk... I meant President Yun say why you needed the dielectric materials?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** He said that we did not understand dialectric materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** And that it was the key to our freedom<br />
*Throk is not in this scene, has been sent to engineering to clean all the blood off the walls.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** He suggested that we strike for the dielectric materials, and pick at the lines<br />
*Throk is later reprimanded for leaving slobber all over the walls from licking them clean.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Are you being attacked a species that uses electrical type-attacks?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** No, we need to undersand the dielectric materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** It is the key to our freedom<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Are you being trapped or held somewhere by electricity?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** No, we are free thanks to President Yun. But if we want to stay free, we need to understand the dielectric materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** We know how to tell if a material is dielectric<br />
*Captain Kaglor holds up a multimeter in the resitance setting*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Did he give you a video with your instructions?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** But we don't understand how they work<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** He gave us our instructions in person, after teaching us about the dielectric materials<br />
*Skig opens up StarfleetGPT and types in, "Explain electrical insulation and resistance like I'm five".*<br />
*Captain Kaglor listens intently as the computer gives a basic, childlike explanation of electrical resistance*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): I would think I need to use that trick on Throk, except I will point out that Throk has a higher Reason stat than Zox.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): is using her Kolea inside voice, hence the OOB.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** This is amazing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** I must tell my crew, this will surely help us better understand the dielectric materials<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** It will be at least four hours before we can move the Pakled who is getting an entirely new digestive system out of Medical.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** To be fair, compared to our last ship engagement, the fact that 2/3 of the crew does not need hospitalization and the Lister is crippled and in need of a tow makes this a relatively successful experience.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, Ghex to Bachar. You guys should come back out to the bridge, the Pakleds are doing something kind of strange. I am not sure what, but I don't think I should be the only one out here.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I doubt that Nausicaan is working directly with the Syndicate, Pakleds are used for dumb labor, giving them a starship, even a D7, is not how they normally operate.<br />
*Hailey Murry emerges to see what they're doing*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** You know, just in case they attack again or something like that. I don't think I can handle that by myself. Even though I am definitely qualified, in general, for this job.<br />
>On the viewscreen, Murry can see the Klingon Cruiser has turned away and is pulling away at impulse power. Behind it, she sees a number of escape pods flying away from the cruiser and towards the Lister<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I recommend we lock tractor beams on those escape pods and check the logs to see if the Klingon ship was issued a remote self destruct, by an Angry Nausicaan.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I don't think they plan to launch an attack with a bunch of unarmed escape pods<br />
