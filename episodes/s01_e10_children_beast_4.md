>INTERIOR - Drug Lab Maintenance Causeway: As Zox and his team begin to climb the narrow ladder up towards the next deck they hear a whoosh from beneath them. Ablast door seals off ahead, just beyond the hatch to level 2. From beneath them, deep in the belly of the facility, a roiling bubbling mass of burning, reacting chemicals begins to churn up from underneath, filling the causeway as it belches and foams with heat, bathing the causeway in a sickly orange glow.<br />

**Dr. Malov:** With the power down, the chemical containment must have also failed. Causeway A is used as an emergency vent for chemical byproducts<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I recommend we exit the causeway<br />
*Lt. Malat tugs at his collar nervously*<br />
*Dr. Malov tugs at his collar nervously*<br />
**Kolea:** I agree with the good doctor's assessment of the situation.<br />
>[ROUND 1]<br />

**Kolea:** Dr Malov, is there a blast door between us and the chemicals below us?<br />
**T'kor:** If we close the blast door below us, how long until the pressure goes critical?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we close the blast door below us, how long until the pressure goes critical?<br />
**Kolea:** I see the lights indicating that there is a blast door there.<br />
**Kolea:** Can we vent the pressure a different direction?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I don't know, I'm a scientist not an engineer<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I stay away from boiling chemical waste<br />
**Kolea:** You know, like when you have a clogged artery and you slice it and cause blood to spray four meters in a different direction while tears shoot out the side of my eyes like I somehow have high pressure hoses attached to my tear ducts.<br />
>[TURN] Hailey Murry<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Okay, is there something that will quench the reaction?<br />
*Kolea just finished voice acting some Hentai, knows all about anime solutions for this problem.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** well, the chemicals used in the refinement are predominantly alkaline, so if you had a sufficient quantity of a powerful acid, you might be able to neutralize them<br />
**Dr. Malov:** But I forgot to bring 600 gallons of HF with me today<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'll need a whole lot of them, though, given how quickly they're filling iup<br />
