>EXTERIOR - Bajor: As Jasanis voice fades from the comms in a maniacal cackle, the ominous whine they can hear is getting louder and louder<br />

**Jasanis:** Good luck girl scout<br />
**Throk:** Throk know this noise. It is not good noise.<br />
*Jasanis laughs and cuts off the channel*<br />

**Throk:** Throk also think Green Woman much scarier when she not have large chunk of green leafy vegetable wedged between bicuspid and left anterior cuspid. Poor dental health make villain seem less scary.<br />
**T'Kor:** Excuse me, sir, I believe your fusion generator may be in need of repair. May I have your permission to see to it?<br />
**Kosal Oram:** Wait how can you tell what she has between her teeth on the basis of an audio channel?<br />
**Kosal Oram:** My generator? Yeah, it's in that shed<br />

**Throk:** Throk think is better idea to stop fusion reactor from blowing new friend into low orbit.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yeah, but we want to leave afterwards<br />
**Throk:** Throk not look good in fetching radioative coloring. Only mighty Voth look good after being irradiated.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Infact, why don't we re-route the shield to the obviously on the fritz reactor?<br />
**T'Kor:** I disagree, Throk, you'd look quite fantastic with the right kind of radiation. You'd positively glow<br />
*T'Kor glows brighter as he says that*<br />

>Zox finds that the generator has been tampered with and its fusion regulator has been disabled. There is no safe way to shut it down, so they will have to do something unsafe instead. Which Zox probably prefers anyways<br />

**Throk:** Throk wonder, have you tried turning it off and back on again?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, we can't contain such a massive amount of energy forever with these dollar-store shields. We can only divert it, and the safest place to do so is underground.<br />
**Throk:** Why not use mighty Security Chief ability to ask orbital station to emergency beam fusion generator into space?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Because we aren't supposed to be here and there isn't an orbital macguffin for us.<br />

**T'Kor:** I cannot provide assistance<br />
**Throk:** Throk going to ignore whatever you two are doing and instead consider value of invigorating pushing of hacking buttons to reroute shield control system to Twins through use of Gorn Headbutt Hacking Technique.<br />

**Throk:** Evidently smashing thick skull into control panel not make it stop.<br />
*Throk looks at Hailey.*<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps you can engage in use of alcoholic powers?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm not an alcoholic, Throk, that requires a very specific diagnosis and I make it a point to avoid accumulating enough factors<br />
*Throk points to coffee cup.*<br />
**Throk:** Caffeine also addiction.<br />
>As the generator continues its overload, radiation from the reactor is overwhelming the shielding and is beginning to affect the away team and their equipment. T'Kor and Zox's tricorders stop working, and Throk's phaser goes off uncommanded, shooting himself in the lg<br />

**T'Kor:** It's not half as strange as Skig's designs<br />
*Throk grabs Zox and rotates him upside down so the characters are "from a different point of view"*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Malat! I need you to re-flux the local shields focus an unstable fusion reaction into a mining drill in less than 45 seconds, game?<br />
>When Zox runs to fetch Malat to assist, he finds her knelt over the twins with the medkit open, giving them a shot from a hypospray<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Aye sir, but I need Murry to take over here<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh woah, what happened out here?<br />

*Throk leaps over the barrier, spins and rolls across the ground and springs to his feet, sprints forward through the entrance scoops up Murry and the Twins, throws all 3 over this shoulders and linebackers into the distance.*<br />
**Throk:** THROK LOVE CARRY OBJECTS. THROK LIVE FOR THIS!<br />
>As the reactor goes critical, a rumble is felt as the plasma jets into the ground. There is not nearly as much upward spill as Malat feared, it seems the plasma must have found a path of less resistance underground. A rare stroke of luck for the beleaguered, oft-injured conn officer<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Remember, this whole area was mined out by the Cardassians years ago looking for precious metals, the fusion reaction should find lots of tunnels to dissapate in!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Good thinking sir, I was worried we were going to be bathed in neutron radiation from the uncontained upward spill and suffer radiation injuries for the rest of the episode<br />

*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 sit back up suddenly and rise to their feet as if nothing happened*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oh you did not just "you people" me<br />
*Zox shrugs*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I do believe that was the Orion Syndicate who did that to you. If you've got aggression you want to take out on someone, perhaps we can help you safely find an outlet there?<br />

**Throk:** Throk look up "smouldering looks" in dictionary. Based on you two, think best solution is moonlit dinner and champagne cocktails while discussing failings of Starfleet disciplinary practices.<br />
**Kosal Oram:** The syndicate has been hassling me for years, but my house didn't blow up until 10 minutes after you show up with a spoonhead<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ok, that's it<br />
*Zox hands Throk some popcorn.*<br />

*Throk inhales deeply and would like to recover stress and hum gentle mantra's to self.*<br />
*Throk eats offered popcorn.*<br />
*Lt. Malat tackles Oram to the ground and begins punching his face*<br />
*Kosal Oram flips Malat off and kicks her in the ribs*<br />
**Throk:** This situation best handled by smart professional like Murry, who would never use alcoholism or systematic brain damage to interfere with job duties.<br />

**Kosal Oram:** Bullshit, what cell?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Senab!<br />
*Zox begins making strange gestures to Throk*<br />
*Kosal Oram laughs a deep roaring belly laugh that seems to shake the ground*<br />
**Kosal Oram:** Kural Senab isn't a resistance fighter, he's a petty criminal<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Running weapons to the resistance!<br />
>Malat gets the upper hand and suplex's Oram, knocking him off his feet and out of the fight for the moment. She stand back up, with blood poring from her nose. Her normally very neatly ordered hair a mess, revelaing a Bajoran earring on her ear that normally would be covered<br />

*Lt. Malat wipes the blood from her nose*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Don't call me spoonhead <br />
*Kosal Oram gets back up to his knees, breathing heavily*<br />
**Kosal Oram:** Noted<br />
*Throk offers Kosal some popcorn and a handerchief.*<br />
**Throk:** She very angry but very competent pilot. I recommend not assuming worst of people based on appearance. For instance, T'Kor is not demonic entity that eats hearts of Gorn Children, like taught in fairy tales.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Are you two feeling okay? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We feel fine, why would we not?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** You went unconscious for a couple minutes, there<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were not involved in Lt. Malat's altercation<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Hmm, odd. Standby<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 make some computing sounds for a moment*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait, where is Ishemok? <br />
*Throk wonders why "It's the End of the World as We Know it" is playing in the background while the Twins say that.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ishemok is gone. I think you need to better calibrate your drinking to avoid total blackouts.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our internal chronometer is slightly delayed compared to the Bajoran time synchronizer, indicating we were inoperable for several moments<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not have any diagnostic data from that time<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ensign Ishemok is still stored in our processing bank<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It seemed like the link between you two was disrupted by the radiation<br />
**Throk:** Throk get that way after eating six pack of burritos from DS9 Burrito Bar.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You must be mistaken, the subspace link between Bynar node units cannot be interrupted by simple radiation<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps complex radiation do it? Much like complex carbohydrates take long to break down inside Murry's intestines, which is why they make constant grumbling noise.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Besides, we have a more pressing matter of what to do next<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Agreed...<br />
**Throk:** That also true, this popcorn not have enough butter.<br />
*Lt. Malat spits out a mouthful of blood*<br />

*Throk looks at Zox.*<br />
**Kosal Oram:** I already told you, they had me over a barrel over my gambling debt<br />
**Throk:** Umm...how we get next place we go? Shuttle craft is long gone. Need esteemed words of leadership wisdom to discern next plan.<br />
*Throk looks at Oram.*<br />
**Kosal Oram:** In exchange for signing one contract, they wiped out 500 bars I owed them<br />
**Throk:** Stomach down over barrel or stomach up over barrel? This important consideration.<br />
**Throk:** 500 bars worth of alcohol probably best done stomach down, may choke on own vomit if stomach up.<br />
*Throk reads note handed to him from offstage person.*<br />
**Throk:** Oh, Bars used for currency, not drinking.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ha!<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oram, do you have a transport? I may know a guy in Rakantha province<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe I'm a bit high on radiation.<br />
**Kosal Oram:** I have a sub-orbital transport, but if you mean who I think you mean I don't want any part of it<br />

**Throk:** Zox, I think indecision caused more by serious burns and lacerations around ear causing constant distracting whistling noise on consciousness, like bad tinnitues.<br />
**Throk:** Try this.<br />

*Throk twists head off rabbit, drinks innards like sports drink.*<br />
>EXTERIOR - Bajor: Lt. Malat lands Oram's transport in a field outside a Bajoran monastery on a hillside. The grounds surrounding it are lush and green, with carefully arranged flowers of many colors in concentric rings around the hill. Bajoran monks in plain brown robes mill about, caring for the grounds.<br />

**Throk:** This Throk kind of place!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Don't eat the flowers<br />

**Throk:** Remember kids, when you are about to eat delicious meat, always pick the right spiciness for your stomachs!<br />
*Lt. Malat leads the away team up the hill towards the monastery, many of the monks stare at the odd group as they pass*<br />

**Senab Kural:** So what brings the high and mighty Starfleet officer Lt. Malat Roda back to my humble home? I thought you were too good for us these days<br />
**Throk:** Does monastic code sometimes require standing on head for thirty-six hours straight while trying to decipher Klingon glyphs? Works well for Throk, he either pass out and have epiphany, or have epiphany and then pass out.<br />

**Senab Kural:** Any of my organs that would be of use to you while I'm at it?<br />

*Throk bows.*<br />
**Throk:** Humblest apologies.<br />
**Senab Kural:** The last time you left here with one my ships, you crashed it and dissapeared for 30 years<br />
**Senab Kural:** So by my math, you still owe ME a ship<br />
*Throk goes to contemplate the natural world by staring at a tree.*<br />

*Throk pulls Senab's voting record.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk think foot in mouth gets chewed on hard.<br />
**T'Kor:** That seems like a bad idea, Zox burned his foot earlier<br />
**GM:** The Federation has "done much to earn this planet its freedom"? For 60 years the Cardassians ravaged "this planet". My home! For 60 years they murdered our families! Stripped our resources! Treated us as chattle! For 60 years we fought! and died!And struggled! Alone! And the Federation? The Federation signed a PEACE TREATY WITH THEM!<br />

**Throk:** Throk agree with Monk-man!<br />
**Throk:** Federation kind of wankers when it comes to treatment of Bajorans.<br />
**Senab Kural:** And I will do NOTHING to aid yours. Good day sir!<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Whatever, fuck him. Let's just steal a ship<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't like the idea of stooping down to his level<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We have a cartel to stop.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Because the car seat implies both that they have a child, and also that it's a car<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Day of Attonment is coming up in a week<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If you want to wait that long<br />
**Throk:** No, child seat indicates door likely unlocked, but have interior child lock, child lock prevents Zox from opening door and falling out while traveling faster than lightspeed.<br />
**Throk:** Dr Zerra and Skig install child locks on all shuttlecraft to keep Zox safe.<br />

**Ishemok:** Due to a small accounting error, the Bajor Orphans fund has blessed us sufficient funds to acquire a convincing ride to Empok Nor.<br />
**Kosal Oram:** I'll go along on one condition: If we find this woman that blew up my house, I'm gonna crush her face in<br />
*Kosal Oram picks up an ion mallet from nearby*<br />
**Ishemok:** Oh I hope you do, but don't beat her up so much she cannot talk. There's bound to be information in her that is priceless, worth more than vengeance.<br />

**Throk:** Throk suspect Jasanis okay having threesome with you both using knives, mallets, and ropes. Throk bring popcorn and video recording equipment.<br />

**Throk:** Throk know firsthand, dead Tholans not make good barbeque.<br />
**T'Kor:** This is a pretty nice ship, but it lacks a lot of the character that I'm used to<br />
*T'Kor makes a series of clicking sounds which pass for a sigh *<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Thlolians are silicon based life, your biochemistry is incompatible with their<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah, you don't feel you can stay clean without a steady supply of lava soap. I understand.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You cannot... barbeque them<br />
**Throk:** According to ship maintenance log, had not needed total refit in at least eight months, definitely not like Lister.<br />
**T'Kor:** We are, as some carbon based life forms say, the barbeque itself<br />
*Throk sets down ship's maintenance manual, pushes back gigantic oversized reading glasses and looks at Twins.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I think I could probably make some improvements, though<br />
**Throk:** Silly Bynars, Tholians are used like charcoal to make barbeque. Not for eating. Charcoal taste bad, just like Tholian taste bad.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Guys, we may have a problem<br />

*Hailey Murry peers over Malat's shoulder to see what's up*<br />
**Throk:** Throk agree, push button on soap dispenser in bathroom is broken.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There's a Cardassian patrol craft about a light year away that just turned onto an interrcept course<br />
