>INTERIOR - Briefing room: Commander Bachar disconnects the comms channel with Vedek Ojun, and turns to face Lt. Commander Malat. She glares at her for a few moments before speaking.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/bachar_elephant.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Lt. Commander: I must have suffered hearing damage at some point, because I believe I just heard this Vedek say that you informed him of the situation here with the Orb we discovered on the surface. But since that is a gross violation of the chain of command and an act of wild insubordination which should land you in the brig, I must have misheard.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Wow, that is crazy. I must have the same problem, because I heard the same thing. I wonder if its some kind of shared psychosis, or mass hallucination. Far out...<br />
*Skig checks for earwax.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm... I mostly heard what could be inferred as a Klingon worthy sense of initiative that can only mean she is challenging the Captain for control of the ship?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Reprimand me then, the Vedek Assembly has a right to know about the Orb<br />
*Skig checks to see if the word "Reprimand" could be misunderstood as "disembowel" in some obscure language.*<br />
*Darisha-Han 's antennae wildly wobble as her eyes light up at the prospect of covering a Starfleet officer torn between duty and faith*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It would've been easier to reveal this to them after we had it in hand<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Are the Vedek Assembly likely to adhere to the Prime Directive?<br />
*Skig suspects Darisha might be getting to see lots of "torn" if Throk is promoted to Chief Security Officer in this situation.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** We can't just take it, it's also an important spiritual artifact to these people<br />
*Hailey Murry sighs*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/bachar_elephant.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** No Commander Murry, I suspect they will not put much weight on the prime directive<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Yeah, that is true, Windbloom<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Prime Directive Ignored...Wait...this isn't newsworthy!<br />
*Darisha-Han throws her notepad to the floor*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** These people don't know what it is, they are hundreds of lightyears <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** To be honest, it is an indication the Prime Directive has already been violated, the questions that concerns me the most are "how did it get there" and "who put it there".<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** These people don't know what it is, they are hundreds of lightyears away from the Celestial Temple. They don't even know about the prophets<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Can the prophets reach out through the orb? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Exactly my point, thank you for agreeing with me Lt Cmdr Malat.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** You can't seriously suggest that they have as much right to the Orb as my people<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** They can, although I don't know if they do this far from the Celestial Temple<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** But it's quite possible that they're communing with the prophets? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Assuming this isn't some sort of complex forgery<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Windbloom, what were they doing with the orb during their rituals? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The Prophets don't communicate in the way we do, they don't experience linear time. Orb experiences are confusing, hard to understand. It takes meditation and deep introspection to even figure out what they are trying to tell you<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We should rule out "complex forgery" first and that will tell us if Miss Malat needs to contact the Bajorans and inform them, "Oh, my bad."<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** There was a fancy lady in far out robes, she was sitting in front of it with her eyes closed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Wouldn't that make it easier for a non-technical species to experience and understand, why, without all the trappings of technology? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Was she breathing?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What does the orb itself look like? Glowing? Floating? Lasers? <br />
*Skig wonders what the native internment rituals for the dead are like?*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): I never thought Kazemi would order exterminatus...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): I mean I knew I would eventually....but...</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Clearly Kazemi has been playing too much Call of Cthulhu and Aliens RPG. He just reaches for "Nuke the Site from Orbit"</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): We make frens with aliens. Alien is fren not target. =D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Fortunately, Skig will not order Exterminatus, it is too much damage to the proton torpedo launchers and might damage the chrome on the launch tubes firing that many at once.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How long until the Bajorans arrive?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Around 20 hours<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Why don't we go down there and try to communicate with the Prophets? What do they feel like? Maybe they were lonely and wanted to spread their ideas of love and peace to more sentient creatures?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do they communicate with just anyone? <br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): wrecked mate.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** So you are saying the Prophets are like the laundry machines on Deck 8 that cause a sock to disintegrate into nothingness a random number of cycles? They also work in mysterious ways.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I mean, it's the only excuse for how all the security officers have mismatched socks.<br />
*Darisha-Han quickly scribbles down that the missing left socks are the result of washing machines, as this is the biggest story of the week.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Windbloom...could you sneak in and communicate with the orb?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Probably not a good idea, if his cloaking goes off that could be pretty catastrophic<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We could just wait until no one is there, beam down, perform a thorough analysis and be ready for emergency beam out if the sensors detect someone approaching?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I can try, I think it would be far out to commune with the Prophets<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm assuming the room is not occupied all the time.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** They have guards patrolling the caves, but iif we're careful they probably won't see us<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Assuming it doesn't interfere with the teleporters<br />
*Skig wonders what level of Blasphemy the Bajorans would consider, "Jem'Hadar warrior causes Prophet to get stoned out of its mind and make bogus proclamations about licking walls".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/bachar_elephant.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** No one is beaming down there without some plan in place to reduce the risk of cultural contamination<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Curious they would have guards.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Are the prophets like the Q, where they occasionally squabble and have family feuds?<br />
*Darisha-Han looks at Malat*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Is this a run-away prophet that was bullied?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): If only Ishemok was here to help them turn a profit?</font><br />
*Darisha-Han looks eager to capture a story.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh I hope this isn't one of the evil ones<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That would explain the distance from the Celestial Temple.<br />
*Skig wonders if there are always two evil ones, a Master and an Apprentice.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The prophets and pah-wraiths don't literally live in the Orbs.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** All right, so I propose we check the following leads: (1) Possible wormhole existence (2) Indications of who brought it and how it got here in the absence of #1, (3) Length of time it has been here, if possible to determine. The age of the temple would be a good start. (4) Is it real, is it a forgery, and if it is a forgery, who gained to place it there?  (5) Betting pool on how long it takes Malat to be imprisoned in her own brig for some reason<br />

>Bachar and the Pelarian priestess materialize into the holodeck. All around them, they see people wearing full body inflatable costumes of strange creatures that they do not recognize: some sort of giant yellow mouse, a large pink creature of a roughly spherical shape, a bipedal winged lizard with flames on its back and tail. The strange costumed people are walking around between folding tables full of merchandise depicting the same unknown creatures.

The room is a large auditorium filled with folding chairs and with a large stage decorated in red, white and blue colors. There are thousands of red, white and blue baloons scattered all across the floor of the room, and streamers hanging from the ceiling. A large banner hangs in the distance that reads "Nixon / Ford '68"

The room is incredibly loud, as the ancient 20th century Earth song "Du Hast" blasts over loudspeakers<br />
