>First Officer's log, Stardate 61797.4: I haven't seen Skig for the past hour, we can just hear her crawling Murry's body around through the maintenance hatches and muttering about Zox and Viraseti. In the meantime, Viraseti and Dr. V'Lora have been locked in an office reviewing the data they gathered with Zox. I have been in the bridge, and so far we are completely unable to determine our location, or the bearing to the Lister.

>And as if all that wasn't bad enough, the Voth sense of smell is incredibly sensitive. I always thought Zox was full of shit when he would sniff the air. But this is a small, crowded ship, and the air filtration has been running in low power mode for hours...

>So: situation normal I suppose.<br />

>INTERIOR - Romulan Vessel: As main power flickers back online, Skig slithers out of a maintenance hatch as Lt. Commander Viraseti calls the crew together to share the findings that she and Dr. V'Lora have been working on.<br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): New an entirely new vocabulary, twice over.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): need*</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Our current situation notwithstanding, Commander Zox's plan to probe the objects directly did yield an incredible amount of data. I have been analyzing it with the help of Dr. V'Lora, and we found something very interesting.<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Throughout all of our readings of the objects, the mass is in a constant state of flux. Even stranger, the mass reading is much less than the local gravitational field deflection. This implies some missing mass which are not able to read.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The key breakthrough that Commander Zox enabled was that, under his probing, the object to underwent a repeated cycle of mass changes. The repetition allowed us to take extremely precise readings of the moment-to-moment mass change.<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** From those data, we worked out that gravitational energy at any given point in time is explicable by adding the mass reading at that moment, and a non-linear function of the mass readings just before and after that moment, multiplied by a time-based factor.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Based on our findings, we have a hypothesis that we believe explains the objects' behavior, and also potentially where we are.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti listens attentively*<br />
*Skig pulls up a graphic on the monitor*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is a 2D facimile of our mystery object<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It appears, undergoes a series of shape and size changes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** and then vanishes<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** is this....flatland?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It's behavioe is inexplicable until we look from a different angle<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That explains our limited perception of them...any leads on why they are so attracted to the singularity core, or where in space we are?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I'm also curious about where the missing mass comes into play here<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So do we need to find a way to rottate them through a four dimensional space to free the ship from its stuck state?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Aha, as the object moves through its additional spatial dimension orthogonally to our own, we can only detect a single 3-dimensional slice of it<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** So we are only able to read a tiny slice of the full object<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** However, the rest of the object is still close enough that the rest of its mass causes a deflection of the local spacetime curvature <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And as for where we are, we have a hypothesis<br />
*Skig places her hand on the surface of the conference table*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Imagine this is us, in our 2-dimensional representation of our spacetime<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Oh! If we use that, we should be able to assess its shape in 4d. Various assumptions could be made for how gravity works through this fourth dimension, but only one should be consistent with our readings...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The object is moving through the table from above, and if it tugs hard enough....<br />
*Skig moves her hand to the bottom of the table and sticks it to the underside of the tabletop*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Everything we know about subspace tells us that the matter of which we are made is confined to our own 3-dimensional space, but like a 2-D plane has a top and bottom when viewed in 3-D, we hypothesize that we have been "flipped" onto the other side of our 3-D universe<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Ah, like the old theories of wormholes?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Or would this be a separate reality?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, entirely physically distinct from our own<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** With no way to return through ordinary means<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Which is... not great news, now that I say it that way<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But the singularity core here would be 0 dimensions to life from life of any dimensionality?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Yes, I suspect it would be almost imperceptable to these objects<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Is it the one common reference inter-dimensional beings could agree on?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Odd that the only commonality is imperceptible...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Could we send signals through it?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** But it creates such extreme curvature, it would change the way that they iteract with the spacetime fabric around it<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The singularity is effectively just a tiny point of extreme space-time curvature, the only form of signal it can emit is gravitational waves<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Which may be perceptible to whatever this thing is, or may not<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Obviously the only thing we know for sure it reacts to is the EM probing that Zox subjected it to<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah, but it reacted to that by dragging us into another universe<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I think we should definitely use that once more at least<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Maybe not right now, though<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Agreed, we need to make sure we get dragged back to where we started<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** When we first encountered the anomoly, it pulled us over 100 light years into Federation space<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** So if we are not careful, who knows where we will end up<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we reverse the sequence of EM pulses that Zox used to see if that returns us to our original location in our normal plane of existence?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Ah, was it only activated once?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We could certainly try<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't think we should try probing it again until we have some idea of where it is going to dump us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Are we talking completely "alternate" or the "mirror" universe and the Terran Empire situation we have references to?<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Of course! The mirror universe, our navigational sensors would be unable to determine a positional fix because the stars have been chirally inverted<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Allow me to un-scromble the data!<br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): 'Confirmed momentum hog'</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok, so that is the issue of navigation. Second problem: how do we actually steer this thing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Because I don't want to rely on pure luck that we end up back where we started<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, then we can collectively use our knowledge of the star charts, inverted to match the gravitational anomalies of the transference that cause transport to the Mirror Universe and follow the curvature of the splines back to our home, right?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ah ha! I just need to adjust the anti-hadoop distortion and adjust for a differential displacement of mass, as if a slight variable had changed in the big bang....<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The computer should be generating and annotating a map shortly....<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Additionally, if we are in the Mirror Universe, given our limited knowledge of it and the fact the last known contact involved knowledge of the collapse of the Terran Empire and civil war engufling what we would consider "Federation Space" we need to make sure we are maintaining a very low profile to avoid drawing the attention of something that can torpedo us to oblivion.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Agreed, let's focus on getting ourselves safely back to where we started without that happening<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And I would prefer to get back sooner rather than later, the last we saw the Lister it was steaming off towards Starbase 34 and I am pretty worried about what is going on there<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Do we have a way to head the Lister off?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I must raise an objection; any technology we could bring back to our own home universe would be of immense import to both the Romulan Empire and Federation. We have a duty to discover.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well if our warp engines were working we could plot a parallel course in this spacetime, but we can't with this thing hooked on us and we can't get it detached until after it drags us back to our own universe<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Do we have a way to drag it in a direction of our choice, though?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hmm, good thinking<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The singularity engine!<br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** That will require some very precise calculations<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We know which way the Lister jumped, if we have a clear destination along that route, it'll be much easier to get help than if we warp back to our time and potentially have a broken ship.<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): (Our space rather than our time)</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): (they are the same thing XD)</font><br />
**Dr. V'Lora:** Well with the navigational computer back online, we should be able to reconstruct how it reacted to prior stimuli and with some careful calculations, work out how to direct it.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok Murry, it's your plan you take the lead on it. The last issue here is getting this thing detatched from the singularity drive<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Once we get back to our space, we need to get unstuck so it doesn't drag us further<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Any ideas there?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** buzz an actual black hole at the exact right trajectory at warp 9 such that it gets pulled off from hitchhiking?<br />
**Skig: [ REA(10) + SCI (5)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 29]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That might work, although it would be extremely dangerous<br />
*Hailey Murry checks to see if there is a risk to the Lister from Zox's plan, determines it is a very low risk to the Lister, thinks it is fine to buzz a black hole at warp 9 in a Romulan runabout.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** As a newly minted hot-blooded security officer, I believe it's the best course of action!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Alright, I feel uncomfortable about every part of this plan. But this is the Lister crew after all <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Murry, you and Viraseti work on the calculations for your navigation plan. Zox, work with Dr. V'Lora to work out a plausible black hole to pass and figure out the safe distance we can target<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I mean the other option is a controlled demoition of gravity bombs, triangulated in such a way as to make a pull vector?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Making the trivial impossible and the impossible trivial is I believe what was put into the crew analysis report by Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, see if you can figure out a way to avoid losing power again the next time this thing drags us across space<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Which Skig? The real Skig or the person in the Skig-suit?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** This is where we need banned sub-space weapons to free our extra-dimensional friends.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Oh goodness! They will call this the V'lora maneuver!<br />
