>INTERIOR - An old school bus parked in a field: Juan Toby waves a detonator and a gun around while shouting at Sam and Pennington. Ignatius is listening in from outside.<br />

**Juan Toby:** You came here for explosives? Well look around you man!<br />
>Juan grabs a detonator off his table, and rips a sound-insulating blanket off the wall to reveal that the walls of his bus are lined with plastic explosives.<br />

**Juan Toby:** I don't have much time left, you don't understand! If I don't get it out there before they get to me, IT'S ALL OVER MAN! END OF THE FUCKING LINE!<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Pennington (T'kor)): What if Juan beats Sam and replaces him?</font><br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Excellent! This quantity of explosives will suffice for our needs. This side (hand wave at one side) can be used to destroy CIA mind-control devices in the Vault. This side (hand wave at the other side) will be useful in destroying the water system controlling the Flouridation process which causes impotence.<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) offers Juan a card.*<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** This person can assist with verifying your cure of impotence after we use these explosives.<br />

*Sam Mulloy suddenly never wants to wheel and deal with humans again. yeesh.*<br />
*Juan Toby 's eyes light up*<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I feel like somewhere, millions of viewers just collectively lost their shit.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No kidding.<br />
**Juan Toby:** Wow man, a kindred spirit<br />
*Skig checks script to see how far we have derailed.*<br />
**Juan Toby:** Take as much as you need, I'll take the bus to the pumping station and blow it to high heavens<br />
**Juan Toby:** But make sure you get evidence of the mind-control devices! <br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Excellent, Funny Hat man can provide good direction.<br />
**Juan Toby:** People need to know man!<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) points to Sam Mulloy.*<br />

>INTERIOR - Skig's Van: The crew meet back in the machine shop to synchronize before they begin the heist.<br />

*Hadija Zawadi checks her watch*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** yes, it is almost ze time no?<br />
*Skig is wearing an eyepatch and a pirate bandana.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Yeah we leave in 10 minutes. Let's review the plan before we set out. We only get one shot at this.<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) looks depressed at nearly killing everyone AND failing medical duties.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** The timed lockout on the vault opens at 0845 and stays open for 15 minutes. So we need to be in position, ready to drill the combination lock by then. Working backwards, that means the Twins need to be at the blackjack tables at 0815. Skig and Murry arrive at the loading dock at the same time.<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) is content to have made a new holodeck friend who had some great mushrooms to share.*<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) offers Pepe some of Juan's mushrooms.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You know the holodeck safety protocols won't actually replicate halucinogenic compounts?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** Oi? A new ingredient? I shall save it for tonight's stew!<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** T'Kor will need to already be in position with Kolea by then, but that shouldn't be a problem. We can assume they will have some privacy and a bit of time.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Don't trip on mushrooms, that will interfere with the plan<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk know many things, for instance, belief in power of mushrooms means they work, even when they should not. Much like religion.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Once the Twns attract the pit boss' attention, we get taken down to their torture room with Throk. T'Kor's sabotage should kill the power at exactly 0830.<br />
*Pennington (T'kor) raises his hand*<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** What shall I do if I am not assigned Kolea? <br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk have firm belief that Pepe and Hadija are brilliant and will lead us to victory.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So when a man loves a woman....<br />
*Hadija Zawadi smacks Malat upside the head*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** You can stall, or take off your suit and burn her into ash<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or make sweet passionate love<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It's a holodeck, none of them are real<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** No kidding, most human males don't have the stamina I've experienced.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** When the power cuts out, Zox starts the fire, and the fire alarm is the signal to execute everything else. Malat and Ishemok storm the casino with the Mohave Cruisers, Throk and I overpower the goons, the Twins kill the backup generator, Skig slips into the club as a firefighter with the getaway gear, T'Kor and Kolea blow the common wall, and we rendezvous at the vault just before 0845.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** What? Zere is a religion that has mushrooms as part of its morel code? Tell me more, Ignatius.<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Lt Malat, just as a reminder I am in reality only a few feet away from you. I'm afraid if I removed my suit, I would probably wind up cooking several of you in the process of freezing to death.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Right, I shall head off to "work" then.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Good luck<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) still cannot believe that humans consider sex "work".*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Once we have the intel, we exfil to Murry waiting with the getaway vehicle and we return here so we can call for the holodeck exit.<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):  [d20 = 8]**<br />
>INTERIOR - Casino Floor: The Twins stride up to the blackjack table exactly on schedule, with Bachar hanging off their arm and Throk following as a body man. <br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):  [d20 = 11]**<br />
>After a few minutes pass, sure enough the pit boss comes over with a couple of goons and places a hand on the Twins' shoulder<br />

**Casimiro Motta:** Excuse me sirs, would you come with me please<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** We'd like to have a word<br />
*Casimiro Motta gestures towards the back rooms*<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Hey, no rough handling small people who are my good luck charm.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 stand up to follow *<br />
*Mobster puts his hand out against Throk's chest*<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** Not you sir, just the magicians<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** We'd kindly ask that you leave the casino<br />
*Casimiro Motta gestures the Twins and Bachar toward the door*<br />
*Casimiro Motta gestures Throk and Bachar toward the door*<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) waits patiently for Bachar to start something, as he does not want to cross prestigious smart lady.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** But sir, where can I cash these out?<br />
*Hadija Zawadi opens her handbag to reveal it is full of hudreds of dollars of casino chips*<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** Ok, real cute. Take her too. Big guy's not invited<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** No, you not taking small good luck charms AND my chip holder. I worked hard all night to collect those.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** You got problem with them, you got problem with me.<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Oh...great pain and anguish.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Ow, I am in such hurt.<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** Apologies ladies and gents that you had to see that. You all enjoy the casino while we deal with this unforunate incident<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) begins reciting Gorn Poetry for 15 minutes after being mortally injured, he saw this in Les Miserables once and it worked for that character.*<br />
*Casimiro Motta speaks to the assembled casino goers watching this beating take place*<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** Drag 'em down. And cuff 'em, I don't want any more problems<br />
>INTERIOR - Casino Offices: T'Kor enters the casino's offices under cover of his fake NGB ID and is met by a young Italian man<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Ignatius Constantine (Throk)): Little do they realize handcuffs mean nothing to Throk. Now...Chinese Finger Cuffs... then we would be hosed.</font><br />
*Giuseppe Garbo looks at T'Kor's ID skeptically*<br />
**Giuseppe Garbo:** You new or sum'in?<br />
**Giuseppe Garbo:** Yer not the usual guy<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Yes I am. I'm supposed to perform the standard inspections and was told that they were, ah, quite straight forward. If you catch my drift<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Wait wait...did I just hear someone say "Fuck the Plan"? Because I'm already doing my part!<br />

**Giuseppe Garbo:** I don't see any inspections on the schedule, and you ain't the regular guy<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):  [d100 = 51]**<br />
*Giuseppe Garbo pins T'Kor against the wall with a serious look on his face before busting out laughing*<br />
**Giuseppe Garbo:** I'm just fuckin' with ya, follow me big guy. I'll show you where we do the "inspections"<br />
*Pennington (T'kor) has six legs and a rather large abdomen, so being pinned against the wall is very awkward for him*<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Ah, thank you!<br />
*Giuseppe Garbo leads T'kor through the back and down the loading dock steps to the social club*<br />
**Giuseppe Garbo:** I got a real special slot machine over here that I think you're really gonna like<br />

*Giuseppe Garbo flashes a grimey smile*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien ("Bubbles" (Kolea)): BACK. AND,,,Hmm...</font><br />

*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:  [d20 = 18]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do you ever get the feeling that the level of insanity we experience is partially self-inflicted?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Like, for instance, if something is happening to T'<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Kor right now that is going to require months of therapy?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** The poor lad was always happier in the storage bay of your ship.<br />
>INTERIOR - Casino Kitchens: Pepe is focused intently on seasoning his alfredo sauce when the power suddenly cuts out. Everyone in the kitchen looks around confused, but Pepe knows now is the time for switft action/arson<br />

**Sam Mulloy:** Nothing could harm him there, just sweltering radiation and a reactor leak.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Everyone on crew has a very extensive portfolio. We tend to attract the more interesting side of Starfleet<br />

>He quickly realizes he has misjudged the amount of grease needed to cause a sufficient fire, as the entire kitchen erupts in a massive conflagration<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I mean, my profile I'm sure is very boring and involves lots of things involving a complete lack of empathy for others, but I'm really curious if Throk's is larger than mine. Oh, and I don't ever want to discuss Kolea, just FYI.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:  [d20 = 18]**<br />
>Four of the other cooks in the kitchen are incinerated, as a wall of flam expands out and engulfs Pepe, burning his simulated face and "blinding" him<br />

>The holodeck control system projects an opaque forcefield over his eyes, blocking his vision.<br />

>Pepe realizes that he isn't blinded after all, it is just carbon scoring on the goggles that Malat gave him. After he takes them off, he can see the glorious destruction and pile of dead kitchen workers that he has wrought<br />
