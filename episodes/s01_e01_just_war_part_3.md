**Zox:** Away team log - Supplemental
Planet Osala proves more enigmatic by the hour. Initial scans
and starfleet intelligence indicated the inhabitants
as scarcely advanced enough to begin the great migration into space,
yet the warp field disruptions we experienced tell of an understanding
of warp field theory beyond our own coupled with the malice to weaponize such knowledge.
I have taken ensigns Kolea and Okadan down with me to the planet finding
a curious den of an off world species known only as Travellers, aptly
named because they clearly do not like visitors. I am proud that
starfleet produces such capable crew, else we may have succumed to
security measures. Whereas Okadan handles himself professionally, I
think something in the air has gotten to Kolea; her pheremones appear
an empty signal as she has not collected enough vegetation to nest properly.
We will attempt to take the Traveller on board for questioning and treatment,
perhaps giving us an opportunity to locate our missing crew.<br />
>INTERIOR - Sickbay: After the emergency transport to sickbay, Dr. Zerra is tending to the stricken Traveller. Commander Zox and the rest of the away team look on...<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** Nurse Kolea, prepare 50ccs of hydroparazimole. I don't know anything about his neurochemistry, but that is my best guess<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Commander Zox, where did you find him? What happened to him?<br />
**Zox:  [d20 = 17]**<br />
**Zox:** This one was in a stasis tube. Kolea provided recussitation, but....<br />
**Kolea:** Right away doctor.<br />

*Dr. Zerra scans the patient with his medical tricoder*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Well I don't know what was down there, but he wasn't in any sort of conventional stasis<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** His memory engrams are hyper-stimulated, whatever was happening he was forming new memories. And lots of them<br />
**Kolea:** I sometimes get that from married men.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** His vitals are stablizing, but it is going to be a while before we can risk waking him <br />
*Zox claws his communication badge.*<br />
**Zox:** Skig, can you come to sick bay and see if our guest is eminating warp fields?<br />
**Skig:** I will run some scans from the bridge to evaluate the situation, then come down after we have determined the best course of action.<br />
**Zox:** Thank you Commander.<br />
**Skig:** Doctor, have you determined if there is any risk of infectious disease or contaminant on this individual that would necessitate higher level quarantine that our current precautions?<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** No indications of anything in the scans commander. He seems to be physically healthy<br />
**Skig:** Thank you, I will be down shortly with the results of the scans.<br />
**Skig:** Dynamic Bynar Duo, you have the bridge.<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Aye sir, we have the bridge<br />
*Zox Orders a security detail around sickbay*<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** Commander Zox, permission to return to my post<br />
<font color="##005500">Feneril: before I am killed</font><br />
**Zox:** Sure.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Were we able to obtain up any information from the system he came from? <br />
*Crewman McAllister runs away joyfully, having survived his first scene*<br />
**Zox:** Hailey, perhaps we should ask our diplomats about this our new guest?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Absolutely<br />
**Skig:** I think that is a good idea Zox, although I am not sure they will know anything specific.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** pulls out her PAD and takes a few notes on it<br />

<font color="##005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Delete first</font><br />
**Zox:** Skig, have you ever given thought to the fragile mammlian nerve system? Do you think it would be possible to analyze heat and nerve signatures when Hailey is talking to the diplomats to determine if they are telling the truth?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Were we able to figure out anything from the automated systems? How long he was there, when he awoke, the nature of the building? <br />
**Oakadan:** I've got those, Doctor. Let me upload them now for you<br />
**Zox:** That is a good question Hailey. Perhaps we should beam down a technical crew with a security detail until the Traveller wakes.<br />
**Zox:** Oh excellent!<br />
**Skig:** Now that the immediate situation has passed, I think that is a great idea, if needed we should return to the surface to gather additional information. Is the high level of radiation dissipating also?<br />

**Zox:** No one leaves sick bay without an all clear and a signature!<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Skig, do you want to take a look at this before I go?<br />
>A level 4 containment field spring up around the Traveller's sickbay bed<br />

**Skig:** The warp field inhibitor affecting the ship has dissipated, there are 20-30 satellites projecting smaller warp fields in geosynchronous locations around the planet, but they are not posing a danger to the ship. We are still without our missing shipmates though.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** The data on the facility has hundreds of instances of "neutralized" organisms within the last 24 hours. Potentially our crew? <br />
**Hailey Murry:** 12 hours, pardon me<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks over Commander Murry's shoulder*<br />
**Skig:** Excellent, that could explain our missing crew, does the number equal or exceed our missing crew count?<br />
**Skig:** And most importantly, how do we get them back?<br />
*Dr. Zerra points to a section of the PADD*<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** These sections look like DNA sequences<br />
*Skig looks over at Zox.*<br />
**Skig:** Also, excellent work in short time, Security Chief, you are to be commended.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Crewman Oakadan, please provide copies of this to Doctor Zerra and Skig. I need to go have a word with Ambassador Talis. <br />
*Zox 's Face pulses red in a chamelon like fashion.*<br />
**Zox:** Thank you.<br />
>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Commander Murry has summoned Abassador Talis for questioning<br />

**Skig:** So did we trigger a defense mechanism that tried to "neutralize" an outside threat to the planet?<br />
**Telar Talis:** What defense mechanism could my people posess that would be a thread to the mighty Federation?<br />
<font color="##005500">Feneril: threat*</font><br />
**Zox:** I count 170 potential ways.<br />
**Telar Talis:** We asked you here to help us, not to spring some trap on you<br />
**Zox:** That may be true. It's possible you are being played by yet another entity.<br />
**Skig:** My apologies ambassador, Zox was not using his inside voice when the door opened.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** It's a good question. How much do you know about your planet's defense mechanisms?<br />
**Telar Talis:** Not much, any such technology was built long before I was born<br />
**Telar Talis:** We have only the stories of our elders, passed down over the many years since<br />
*Zox points to small holes in the side of his head.*<br />
**Telar Talis:** We know that we once ruled the stars, as you do<br />
**Hailey Murry:** What sorts of stories did they tell? <br />
**Telar Talis:** When the war began, we fought on the ground, in the air and in the stars above our world<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): How long ago was this?</font><br />
**Telar Talis:** All of our space-faring vessels were destoyed within a decade<br />
**Telar Talis:** When we ran out of ships, we fought with planes. And when we ran out of planes, we fought with phasers, and guns, and eventually our bare hands<br />
*Zox stares at Telar's hands. Zox is not impressed at their war-making capacity.*<br />
**Telar Talis:** If there is some planetary defense system that is threatening your ship, then it must have been the Northern Front's doing<br />
**Hailey Murry:** I have to wonder if it was a technology that came before the war<br />
**Zox:** Very much so, if you cannot remember how long it has been, how accurate could your arsenal inventory be?<br />
**Skig:** Such is the travesty of war, that regression into stone age technology follows this level of destruction, it is fortunate you skipped the "global thermonuclear" option.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Do you know if citizens from the Central Republic been frequenting those ruins recently?<br />
**Telar Talis:** No, the Northern Front occupied that land 20 years ago<br />
**Skig:** Ambassador, realistically, if the Northern Front was capable of this, I would expect them to have overrun and conquered you long ago. Not as an insult to the bravery of your fighters, but because if they had the ability to incapacitate and neutralize hundreds of people from space, they could have applied such technology to eliminate entire armies of yours.<br />
**Telar Talis:** They stole it from my people<br />
*Zox Seems to nod in agreement with Skig.*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Do you recall the original name for the ruins? <br />
**Skig:  [1 = 1]**<br />
**Telar Talis:** It was once a city: Tuvad Durikah<br />

**Telar Talis:** My grandfather told me it was a beautiful place once<br />
**Hailey Murry:** It still is, though in a different way<br />
**Skig:** I'm going to check some things, Zox, could you come with me while Murry pumps the ambassador for information?<br />
**Zox:** Absolutely.<br />
**Kolea:** WAIT A MINUTE!  There is no pumping for information without me!<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ INSIGHT  (12) +  CONN  (3)]

**Skig:** Shush you, you are not even in this scene.<br />
*Skig steps outside into the hallway.*<br />
*Zox stares at Skig.*<br />
**Zox:** Satellites need to be rounded up. You too, surely were thinking of a creative way to approach this while enduring that banter?<br />
**Telar Talis:** We asked the Federation for help because, in the stories of our elders, the Federation was a gleaming empire of peace with umatched technology and neutrality<br />
**Telar Talis:** I am sad to see the stories were wrong, your crew are missing and the best you can do is ask us for help...<br />
**Skig:** Zox, it appears the satellites are in a geosynchronous orbit, patterned after a net which is likely intended to defend the planet. Given what the ambassador told us and the length of the war going on, I am somewhat suspicious this entire array either was installed after their lost their spacefaring ability or was installed long ago to protect this species, similar to systems installed by the preservers.  What is your take?<br />
**Zox:** Yes.<br />
**Zox:** I trust your summation.<br />
**Skig:** I would prefer not the destroy them, but to collect them for research and examination. However, I am worried there is a risk of triggering additional defensive responses as we test them. What do you suggest as the Security Chief to keep the crew and ship safe while we investigate this?<br />
**Zox:** But I feel excessive use of force will be bad now, rather a gravimetric well should be used to pull them into a Lagrange point, incase our crew is stranded in them.<br />
*Zox blinks in reptile.*<br />
**Zox:** Yes we think alike.<br />
**Skig:** Excellent, I had not considered that option, but that is a logical next step. Let's see how we can enact that plan.<br />
**Hailey Murry:** We're doing quite a bit more at the moment. I'm confident that we'll get to the bottom of this, but it does appear that we're dealing with something that is tied into the history of your planet. Pre-war, even, by the looks of it. I imagine we'll have the situation resolved sooner rather than later!<br />

**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Zox and Skig find a rather crude but effective system at the heart of the satellite: A small warp core and nacelles, capable of generating a small warp bubble<br />
>Zox and Skig find a rather crude but effective system at the heart of the satellite: A small warp core and nacelles, capable of generating a small warp bubble<br />

**Zox:** Very interesting. Rather than be centralized, a distributed denial of warp serivce proves very effective!<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Species of Origin?  Age of Device? Control mechanism? Is it possible to remotely disable the rest? Are they performing some sort of stabilization or protection of the planet and would cause danger to the planet or the inhabitants by disabling these? Most importantly, any indication of how we can get the rest of the crew back?</font><br />
*Zox exhausted after actually being productive, begins chewing on whatever potted plants are about.*<br />
**Skig:** It was somewhat centralized, I believe these are augmenting whatever was being generated by the Traveler facility, but without it the defense mechanism dissipated quickly.<br />
*Zox chews slower, not sure if the information or the leaves are tastier.*<br />
*Kolea Very intentionally keeps random potted plants all over the ship and cares for them, as she was tired of Zox nibbling on her and thinking she was a walking plant that enjoyed being slobbered on while she was in uniform.*<br />

>Skig is fairly confident that this is Osalan technology, it is crude and fairly primitive, but very clever. The device is at least 120 years old. The control mechanism is a standard computer core. You can't tell whether they are providing any usefrul protection to the planet. As to evidence of where the crew might and how to get them back, Skig recalls that Starfleet has previously recorded instances of officers becoming trapped in static warp bubbles <br />

**Oakadan:** Hmmm, does this mean we need to reinstate the Traveler to retrieve the crew? <br />
**Kolea:** Quite possibly.<br />
**Skig:** Quite possibly.<br />
*Skig uses com-badge to contact Medical Chief and see how the Traveller is doing and if we can rouse him.*<br />
**Zox:** I trust our technical ability more than an alien that tried to poison us.<br />
**Skig:** A warp bubble is a self-contained region of space, it is possible our crew is being held in some sort of stasis field within it.<br />
**Oakadan:** To be fair, I think it was robots that tried to poison us<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Yes Commander, it should be safe to attempt to revive him now<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** His vitals are stable, but he is still... doing that transparency thing<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Now that Im thinking about it, Artemis (the ST bridge similation) was basically a more elaborate form of among us.</font><br />
**Zox:** Hrm.<br />
**Skig:** Zox, if we can engage in diplomatic discourse with a species that Starfleet has limited contact with in a peaceful fashion and improve our knowledge of warp fields and this technology (gestures at satellite) then that is the route we should take. However, a backup plan using our own technology is never a bad idea.<br />
**Zox:** Sure.<br />
**Skig:** Murry, would you meet us in the medical bay and assist with politely inquiring of our guest all the particulars of his life up to this point?<br />
**Hailey Murry ***(comms)*: I'm on my way<br />
>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Zox, Skig and Commander Murry return to Sickbay to question The Traveller about the warp bubble satellites.<br />

**Skig:** Zox, while she is doing that, if you could work with the Bynar Dynamic Duo on determining how effective our backup plan of locating the warp bubbles where our crew is being held, that would be excellent.<br />
**Zox:** Sure thing!<br />
>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Skig and Commander Murry return to Sickbay to question The Traveller about the warp bubble satellites.<br />

*Dr. Zerra gives the Traveller an injection, and he slowly opens his eyes*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Good morning!<br />
*Traveller looks around the room with a pained expression on his face*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Would you like something to drink? I think you've been out of it for quite some time<br />
**Traveller:** I do not know how much of your time it has been, for me it has been... eternities<br />
**Hailey Murry:** It sounds like it's been incredibly hard<br />
**Traveller:** You are not the beings that confined me<br />
**Hailey Murry:** We are not. How did you end up in there? <br />
**Traveller:** I came to this world on my travels, they tricked me, used me....<br />
*Traveller trails off*<br />
**Traveller:** All those people...<br />
*Kolea gets very angry at sound of imprisonment and being used.*<br />
**Traveller:** I have seen things... Done things... <br />
**Skig:** Doctor, Murry, I need to attend to other matters, I leave this in your capable hands.<br />
*Skig departs.*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Of course<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Would you like something to drink or eat? <br />
*Skig heads up to the bridge to meet with Zox.*<br />
**Traveller:** No, their... machine made sure my phsyical needs were met<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Yet eating and drinking can serve other purposes as well. I've always found the ritual to be calming<br />
*Hailey Murry takes a sip of tea*<br />
**Traveller:** No! I have been a prisoner here too long, I will not be confined any longer.<br />
*Traveller stands up and walks through Zox's containment field, then begins to phase out of physical space again*<br />
