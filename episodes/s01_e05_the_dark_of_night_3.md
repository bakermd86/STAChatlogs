>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: After she lunged at the incapacitated Bolian laying in a stasis field in sickbay, Zox frog-marches Counselor Murry into the briefing room to explain her latest violent outburst to Captain Baras and Commander Bachar. Nurse Kolea follows along with a neural scanner to see what is wrong with Murry.<br />

*Skig whistles cheerfully while oblivious to the violence Murry is engaged in. Walks over the dead bodies while investigating the debris scavanged from the Federation vessel.*<br />

*Kolea dislikes being non-consensually assaulted.*<br />

*Zox looks to Kolea for some explanation of this behavior.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Hmm, I do recall there was something about a mutiny in your file, but the details were under seal<br />
**Kolea ** *(whispers)*: Deep-seated and unresolved hostility and violence issues that should be worked through in a mental health clinic, not while operating as a ship's counselor.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** She left us what I'm SURE she thought was a heartfelt farewell about how it was nothing personal, but she also chose to NOT send down any supplies other than what was included in the shuttle<br />
