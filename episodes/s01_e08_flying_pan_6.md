>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Commander Bachar sits at the head of the conference table while the senior staff file in. After glaring at Dr. Zerra for an uncomfortably long time, she puts a hand on her temple and begins to speak.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** By my chronometer we have 16 hours to untangle this mess without violating the prime directive or causing a massacre. The captain and I have a call in 15 minutes to brief Starfleet Command on this shit-show of a first contact. When I come out of that meeting I expect to hear a plan that won't get any of us court martialed.<br />
**Throk:** If we skip court-martial and go with executed, is that okay?<br />
**Throk:** Throk need clarification.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** takes out a spray bottle and sprays Throk<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** No, bad Throk<br />
*Cmdr Bachar takes out a spray bottle and sprays Throk*<br />
*Skig sends Throk off to get some cookies.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar checks her chronometer*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Dismissed<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** She seems unhappy<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** To the science laboratorium!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Now you're talking my language.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, I've seen her unhappy, this is more like mildly choleric.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So we need to avoid contact as much as possible while also preventing the entire village from being wiped out<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Viraseti, can you assist me with a deep amino acid homology search using this sample against all known species?<br />
*Zox puts on glasses*<br />
*Zox puts on a lab coat*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Of course<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The Xepai Collective wanted to wipe out the villlage because of a toxic ideology. Could we somehow make it seem like it was all a ruse by the priesthood? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This is going to be a BLAST<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Breakk their faith in the group? <br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 14]**<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay, let's see what makes these buggos tick....<br />
**T'Kor:** I believe it is carbon<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would guess they refer to chronometers of some type for time-keeping, and therefore tick in the same way as Commander Bachar, but not Tok in the same way as Kolea.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I like your thinking Hailey, but I don't see how<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** These people are deeply religious, how are we going to break them of that in 16 hours?<br />
**Throk:** By having their current saviour engage in such heinous acts they scorn all religion?<br />
*Throk hands Dr Zerra Type-2 Phaser set to "Genocide"*<br />
*Dr. Zerra spit takes his rak'tajino*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And we have to do so in a way that doesn't convince the Xepai Collective to kill them all<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So we can't just reveal the singularity nor the high tech that makes up the temple<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We could probably imply that the church was the one causing the illness this entire time, all for the sake of power. Perhaps with holograms of some of their deceased priests?<br />
*Zox furiously pushes buttons on computers with Viraseti*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I'm having so much fun doing science with my Starfleet colleagues! This is so much better than having my arm broken again.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am sure you will break your arm again<br />
*Dr. Zerra turns back to murry*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I like the idea of using holograms<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Maybe get T'Kor involved too, since they think he's their god<br />
**T'Kor:** Or one of them, at least. I With some holographs, I could probably appear even closer<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** How do we explain their dead priests, who died first of the radiation caused by the singularity, were trying to gain power?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I was thinking holograms of said priests, secretly alive all this time<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Don't you think it's a wee bit presumptuious that you know how best to guide the Venonan?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We don't need to guide them, we just need to undo our own contamination so the Xepai don't wipe them out<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Xepai are the ones we need to figure out how to... yes, the thing Zerra just said.<br />
**T'Kor:** This is quite the significant goal<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So, I think Viraseti and I just figured out something that may persuade the Xepai of the error of their ways. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Oh is that what you were doing?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I thought we were working on a research paper<br />
*Skig gets out popcorn.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Picking up citations AND fostering interspecies peace are both excellent C.V. buffs<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I call first author<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Sure thing!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What did you find?<br />
*Zox gives Hailey Murry a hug*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We aren't so different, are we, my little egg-stealing mammal?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is getting awkward and I'm sure by now Bachar is looking for us.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Don't get her pregnant again<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Though it's heresy in Voth culture to acknowledge it, we share the same homeworld and the same ancestry.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yet our civilizations are starkly different, and have much to share, only because we were both free to evolve and change and learn in this marvellous universe, independently<br />
*Hailey Murry rubs her temples and performs her own recommended anger management expressions*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is there another underground speceies?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Xepai are actually, albeit distantly, related to the Aurari, they probably have as much to share as Voth and Humans did.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** In either case, directing biological or technological evolution won't produce anything original<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** There's a real case for hands-off, serendipity here. If the Xepai want the Venonans to be the best allies, they need to just leave them alone. They don't have a case for non-interference, what with that giant spider god statue, and neither was our interference welcome. If they want the best allies later, let them develop.<br />
*Cmdr Bachar returns from her meeting with the captain*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What do we have people?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** All options on the table<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We make it known to the Xepai that they are just one branch of their founding species, and they have an extant cousin in the Aurari. One that would have been impossible to learn from had they not diverged so long ago.<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest Dr Zerra commit war crimes against Venovan to drive them into murderous frenzy against their new God.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** equally impossible to learn from had they tried to direct their progress.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Bad Throk, down boy<br />
*Cmdr Bachar sprays Throk*<br />
*Throk tries to give Dr Zerra the Type 2 Phaser again*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Even if they are overly-cold, rational beings, if they want the best allies in the future with new technologies and ideas, they need to learn to be aloof.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Venonans will figure out for themselves what works and what doesn't, but they never had a chance to do so with that ship-wreck<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do we know if this is a position that this specific species in the Collective holds or is this a Collective thing in general?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Aurari are very independent, compared to the more collective Xepai<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So, it would appear to be more unique to the Xepai<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** According to the cultural exchange data you negotiated for, their social organization is extremely rigid but highly egalitarian<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** They have no real leaders, they have a consensus-based governance<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So this would largely be an agreed upon viewpoint? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** It seems to be<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I think there's no harm in Zox trying to talk to them, but time is limited and that seems like a long-shot.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I still want a backup option in case Zox suplexes this one into a table as well<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It would explain why they seek consensus and do not want confrontational additions to their collective.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes Commander, I just take this one personally, as many Voth were scorned as heretics for suggesting commonalitiies with humanity. It really helped us learn and grow once we got over it. I would not want to deprive the Xepai of this, nor would I want to see the Venonans deprived of their right to develop.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This is exactly where the Federation's ideas are best. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This isn't even confrontational, I think they're concerned that the Nonan are being too non-confrontational, resorting only to prayer rather than action<br />
*Zox tears MIGHTY dino tears.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes, but that will sort itself out<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Alright Zox, I'm convinced. You can go ahead and invite Satag back to the Lister and talk to him. But in the meantime: Murry, Skig and Zerra, I want you to keep working on an alternative<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Dismissed<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey - which would you trust more, a civilization that learns to prune bad ideas when confronted with them, or one that lacks this ability, having never been exposed to some?<br />
*Zox adjusts his lab glasses, looking to Hailey*<br />
>INTERIOR - Transporter Room: Zox has put on his finest dress golds to welcome Satag back to the Lister and attempt to defuse the conflict at hand.<br />

*Satag materializes on the pad*<br />
**Satag:** Greetings again<br />
**Satag:** To what end have you invited us to return?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Greetings, Primark Satag<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Two of our top scientists have some knowledge that may expand your mind. The Xepai are a larger family than you may think, for you are related to the Aurarai.<br />
*Zox offers some PADDs with scientific jarble all over them.*<br />
**Satag:** Yes we are aware of this<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting! We would not have thought this given the distances involved!<br />
**Satag:** We have long had diplomatic relations with the Cardassians, through them we are aware of many other species<br />
**Satag:** We remain in our own space, but we are not incurious about the rest of the galaxy. We simply prefer to remain close to our homeworlds<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I find this fascinating, as the Aurarai are known to be very curious by nature.<br />
**Satag:** Do you believe that entire races' behavior is determined by their genetics?<br />
**Satag:** We do not<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(not to Satag)*: Hmmmm, hmmmmm, do you think there may be members of that tribe who are not so convinced?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Absolutely not, I do indeed believe it is a case of culture and ideas.<br />
**Satag:** We agree, the marker of an intelligent species is their ability to behave in ways not dictated by their DNA<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But I do think it is an interesting case in divergence. Would such variety be possible had there not been a split?<br />
*Throk brings in a platter of Venovan sausages.*<br />
**Satag:** That depends. In our culture, such a conflict would have to be resolved in order to come to a consensus. But your ship is full of many different, diverging sorts. So separation is not requried for disagreement in all cases<br />
**Satag:** We must come to agreement to act however, that is our way<br />
**Satag:** Such a fundamental conflict must be resolved in order to function<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is not a better consensus reached by having more robust disagreements?<br />
*Satag laughs*<br />
**Satag:** Our disagreements are very robust<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would the Venonans not be better allies if they are allowed to see the folly of their ways by themselves, such that they would not be led astray later?<br />
*Satag shakes his head subtly*<br />
*Throk agrees with Satag.*<br />
**Satag:** You do not understand <br />
**Throk:** Security Chief does have ability to spray down those who do not understand with phaser fire. Throk think he understand though, consensus only found through application of big words and nap time.<br />
**Satag:** There is a saying from your cultural database: "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes that is a very human encapsulation of the problem.<br />
**Satag:** We do not believe in strength for its own sake, or for one's betterment or personal journey<br />
*Throk notes down that saying for future use.*<br />
**Satag:** But because you must not weaken the social fabric of your people<br />

Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 15]**<br />
**Satag:** The Venonan world is inside our space, one way or another they will one day develop warp travel and will have to integrate into our collective<br />
**Satag:** When that happens, we must ensure that they do not weaken the bonds of our society<br />
*Hailey Murry is on a terminal and her pad, sifting through footage and scans from Zerra, the Lister, and Old Faithless*<br />
**Throk:** Throk has serious question.<br />
*Throk raises hand.*<br />
**Satag:** Whether or not they would be stronger themselves by being allowed to develop on their own, they would weaken the collective if not properly prepared<br />
**Throk:** If Venovans develop warp technology but would weaken collective, what would Xepai Collective Response be?<br />
**Satag:** I cannot say. They live in Xepai space, they will be part of the collective no matter what<br />
**Satag:** I cannot predict what consensus will be reached in that future<br />
**Satag:** But if consensus cannot be reached, our social fabric will break down, and I fear conflict would be inevitable<br />
**Throk:** Corollary, if Xepai encountered race inside their space that already has warp technology, and does not agree with collective, how would collective respond?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I used to think this way entirely. As young 'saur, I found humans to be squishy and weak, with bad starship design. The Voth way was superior. But there were some things we could not even concieve of, could not even think of, developed by the Federation. Had we kept the humans as pets, this would have never happened.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And they were such lovable little furry creatures, great for pest control.<br />
**Satag:** We do not see the Venonan as pets<br />
**Satag:** They will inevitably grow into our equals, that is the way of the world. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Correct, but can they be your equals if you too heavily guide their development?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The universe taught you. Should it not teach them?<br />

[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]
Failed on DC: 1 [d20 = 14]**<br />
**Satag:** I cannot argue with your position that the Venonan would be better served by developing on their own. Were they not in our space, this would be the best way for their species to proceed<br />
**Satag:** But without proper guidance, they pose an existential risk to our entire social fabric<br />
**T'Kor:** You mentioned that they will, inevitably, become a part of the collective. That would be the results of the Collective's proverbial gardening? <br />
**Satag:** No, they would eventually develop space travel on their own, whether or not we intervene<br />
**T'Kor:** Oh. If they are a poor fit for the Collective at the time, would they still be brought within the folds, then? <br />
**Satag:** They would<br />
**Satag:** Their world is inside our space, it is untenable for them to simply exist as an independent government within our own borders<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Skig, Dr Zerra, look at this. Throk, look at that over there. So it appears that Tabak, the initial man who encountered your crash landing, harbors some pretty bitter feelings about the whole religious caste. It's quite possible that he may be able to convince others. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would a redrawing of borders make this easier?<br />
**T'Kor:** And presumabnly they would not want to leave their home planet behind, yes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That could be an angle to work towards.<br />
**Satag:** Very few do<br />
*Satag turns to Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If it were possible to revise sub-article J of the current treaty, and the Xepai were given a planet of equal or greater material value?<br />
**Kolea:** The surest way to change someone's religion is give them sufficient internal self-worth.<br />
*Kolea is talking in the room with Skig and Murry.*<br />
**Satag:** Planets are not fungible, billions of Xepai live on them. We cannot simply relocate entire worlds for the purpose of redrawing our borders to the benefit of these Venonan<br />
**T'Kor:** Are there billions of Xepai on the Nonan's world? <br />
**Throk:** Throk has another serious question.<br />
*Throk raises hand.*<br />
*Zox looks at Throk*<br />
**Satag:** You do not need to raise your hand<br />
**Throk:** If Xepai society is based on collective agreement.<br />
**Satag:** I am not your brood-docent<br />
**Throk:** Commander Bachar said I need to raise hand when brain is working.<br />
**Throk:** Anyway, not relevant to current conversation.<br />
**Throk:** How do Xepai know that what Venovan's have experienced and their current system of belief is going to negatively effect development in a way that does not strengthen collective through enhancing alternative thought through robust disagreement?<br />
*Satag takes out a small device, sets it on the table, and activates it*<br />
>A blue flame emits from the top of the device, Throk and Zox can feel the heat emitted from it from where they are sitting<br />

**Satag:** Why don't you put your hand in there?<br />
**Satag:** You know little of my people's technology. How do you know that this device won't make you stronger, cure your diseases, end your aging?<br />
**Satag:** Of course you are an intelligent species, you know better than to play with fire on the off-chance it might not burn you<br />
**Satag:** The risk of disunity is too great to take the chance<br />
**Throk:** Technically momentary euphoria caused by immolation could convince someone they are stronger, also, being immolated does cure disease and end aging.<br />
**Throk:** Ergo, your argument is not valid.<br />
*T'Kor puts his hand in the fire*<br />
**Satag:** You do not count<br />
**Satag:** You are made of fire!<br />
*Throk waits for Zox to high-five T'Kor, since Throk is smart enough to know that is a bad idea.*<br />

**Satag:** You have raised some interesting viewpoints. I do admit that our actions are imperfect and it would be better for the Venonans to be left alone<br />
**Satag:** But you have again misunderstood our ways<br />
**Satag:** I am not a leader, I do not make the decisions or give orders<br />
**Satag:** I am bound to carry out the consensus <br />
**Satag:** You have given me much to think about, but I must still continue in our course of action. My own feelings on the matter must be subservient to the consensus<br />
