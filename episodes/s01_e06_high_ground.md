>Captain's log, Stardate 61240.9: We have diverted from our diplomatic mission to Sulani IV at the request of Lt. Cmdr Viraseti. She asked me to call a briefing of the senior staff so she can explain what this is all about. She says it is urgent, so I have approved her request to divert even though I don't yet know what this is all about. I hope she isn't wasting my time, I would like to imagine a starfleet officer would never do that, but with this crew you can never be too sure...<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Lt. Cmdr Viraseti connects her PADD to the briefing room monitor and pulls up a diagram view of a globular cluster at a fourier transform.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ever since our encounter with the Traveler from Tau Alpha C I have been working with colleagues at the Argus array to monitor for his unique warp signature.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have been researching the nature of his warp field manipulations, hoping it could be put to some good use. But a few hours ago we detected something very strange.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Always a good sign<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I detected a matching signature in a nearby globular cluster, but this one had a markedly different subspace spectrum. It looked like an attempt to replicate the sort of warp bubbles that the Traveler created using a conventional warp engine.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The cluster is less than 20 light years away from our course, so I asked the captain if we can divert to investigate. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It shouldn't add much delay to our mission, and the potential scientific value is immense<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...So...either smugglers or an uncharted civilization wants to be as cool as the Traveler?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And it's pretty much guaranteed that whoever it is had access to information on the Traveler? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Possibly, I am hoping to get a better reading of the residual warp energy when we are closer to the signal<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, that is a safe bet<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would recommend reconfiguring Modular Laboratory 4 next to the Port Sensor arrays to take better advantage of the warp bubble signatures. The starboard side array has been failing higher level diagnostics and keeps switching to a Klingon Opera Playlist.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
*Zox acts innocent.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do we have any information on Starfleet operations in the area that might be engaged in some technical testing we might not be normally privvy to?<br />

*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 tap a few keys on their PADD*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's some keen thinking, but I can't recall any.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Starfleet records indicate no Starfleet vessel has been in this cluster since stardate 44300<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, do we have an approximate size of the warp bubbles and do they have subspace eddies that may interfere with our warp bubble within a certain range?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** One has to assume someone would want to use the Traveler's abilities for a military purpose.<br />
*Lt. Malat nods in agreement. *<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** History has conclusively proven that all inventions stem from military need or Rule 34.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** At our current range, I can't say much as to the topology of the warp bubble<br />
*Skig checks script to see if that is what her line was supposed to be. Decides later to to a web search on Rule 34 and figure out what that means.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have Ensign Ishemok monitoring as we approach<br />
*Skig runs a diagnostic to see if Ishemok is making off with any monitors in the modular laboratories.*<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps we should check in on him though, I don't know if he as access to heavy cutting equipment<br />
**Ishemok ** *(intercom)*: Esteemed officers of the Lister: I am recieving a strange communications signal on baroque radio frequencies, but require help decoding them, any volunteers? Perhaps some Bynars?<br />
*Skig flips up internal security cameras to show three of them focused on Ishemok at all times.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** He seems to have not stolen anything in the last...<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Patch it through to the briefing room Ensign, we'll have a look<br />
*Skig speeds checks recordings.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** 27 minutes.<br />
*Ishemok beep boop beep, patching...*<br />
>Ishemok pulls up a frequency analysis of a far-infrared radio signal he has been receiving from the same direction as Viraseti's warp bubble signal<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If the communications signal is not baroque, don't fix it.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If it's just stealing from the mess hall, it's not that big a deal, we all take extra cookies no?<br />
*Kurij waits by the dedicated console labeled "TIME SINCE ISHEMOK'S LAST THEFT", ready to hit the reset button*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No way it could be a comm signal, it's old-fashioned radio, light speed only<br />
*Skig makes a note to apply electro-shock lightning arcs to anyone who takes extra cookies from the food replicators.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Har har, Voth first rediscovered humans by picking decaying radio signals from Earth. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Radio was the original comm signal used by Earth and several other civilizations for quite some time.<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 17]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let me see if I can do a breakdown on the signal and pull it apart into its constituent pieces. There may be clues in there. <br />
*Skig evaluates the waveform to see if it is an analog or digital transmission, and the quality of it.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ishemok, can you determine if the signal is getting closer or further away based on shift?<br />

Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 28]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So it looks like this is the same general pattern as a Starfleet Comm signal, but we'd normally expect this to be in a subspace band. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It should be orders of magnitude higher in frequency<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe the traveler is trying to make some nascent civilization survive technological adolescence.<br />
**Kurij:** Stronger as in it's coming at us?<br />
>Skig routes the signal into the comms, a strange, periodic pop is heard from the speakers, but nothing else<br />

**Ishemok:** Yes!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, this is better than a diplomatic mission already!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Anything to get out of wearing a dress uniform<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think the dress uniform looks quite good on you, Lt Malat, it's a shame you don't get the opportunity to wear it more often<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nonsense Malat, the fluted skirt looks fine on you. At least you to do not have hairy tree trunk legs.<br />
*Lt. Malat looks visibly annoyed*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well we've been reading the signal continuously for the past 8 minutes<br />
*Skig checks to see if Malat has done anything worthy of being thrown in the brig to avoid having to wear her dress uniform. Cannot find anything specific, but decides to mention that option later when fewer people are around.*<br />
**Kurij:** How long since the faux Traveler signal? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And at our current warp factor, that means the signal has been transmitting continuously for several years at least<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And? Do they bring peace or war?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Because we have covered 3.6 light years since Ensign Ishemok first detected it<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If the signal is getting stronger, it is safe to posit they are being generated by the warp bubbles?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If it is a comms signal, then they certainly have a lot to say<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What if they are putting radio signals IN warp bubbles if they haven not yet discovered subspace? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Interesting hypothesis, an attempt to reproduce faster-than-light communications via radio signals in warp bubbles? It may be possible, but it seems much more difficult than ordinary subspace communication<br />
**Ishemok: [ REASON  (8) +  SCIENCE  (2)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 27]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However, if the goal was to communicate with something inside the warp bubble that did not have access to modern communication equipment, that might be feasible. Remember that Murry said this was a Federation Comm signal.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It certainly seems like one, yes. What do the records say about the last vessel in this area? <br />
**Ishemok:** Negative Zox; this signal is information poor and is unlikely to be the transmission of a message.<br />

**Ishemok:** oh thank goodness. Thanks Ishemok.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** oh thank goodness. Thanks Ishemok.<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d20 = 11]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, the last trip here didn't actually fully survey the cluster. They detected "dangerous levels of spacial curvature" and left without risking anything.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oh shit, I should go turn off the autopilot and fly the ship then<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait, no there was another one. The USS...Crazy Horse was presumed lost here with all hands during the Dominion War. They were just on patrol and vanished in the system. <br />
*Lt. Malat darts back out to the bridge*<br />
**Kurij:** I'll provide assistance!<br />
*Kurij heads off after Lt Malat*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Spatial curvature is likely a result of warp bubbles and temporal distortion.<br />
*Zox lets out careful gazes across the briefing room while filing his talons.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not necessarily, spatial curvature can be caused by any large gravity well<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Would the warp bubbles and temporal distortion have been something that the USS Baton Rouge would have mentioned during their survey, though? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It seems that perhaps it was more passive? And now is more active for some reason? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True, although the fact radio waves are escaping it reduces the risk of various spectral phenomena like interstital black holes and light absorbing gravity wells.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well a radio signal could still originate near a black hole, it would just be red-shifted<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So....there's an amateur HAM radio guy stuck on a vessel that just thinks it survived a Cardassian attack, and we are gonna rescue them just in the nick of time?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Active black holes emit significant x-ray  signals along the axes of their rotation<br />

[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]
Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 3]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti how much closer do we need to get before we drop to normal space and safely evaluate the signal and the warp bubbles?<br />
*Hailey Murry is ecstatic that she gets to use her acoustics knowledge*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So assuming that the original is a standard subspace signal, this infrared signal id redshifted by a factor of 2.7*10^-6<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Intersting assumption. We've recorded approximately 3.6 years worth of this signal, if you're right then that would equate to... around 40 seconds of subspace communications<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Then consolidate that down into a single compression and see if it plays back as something other than a "pop" sound.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I need to know! What does it say!<br />

>Skig ramps up the playback speed and the pops get more frequent, blur together into low frequency sounds, and then ramp up in frequency into a discernable voice<br />

**Captain Dowers:** Repeat: This is Captain William Dowers of the USS Crazy Horse, we are under attack by three Jem'Hadar fighters. We're trying to lose them in the...<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Huh. Do you think they lost them?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat (Over comms):** Senior staff to the bridge, there's something you should see<br />
*Zox reaches for a Luchadore mask on hearing Jem'Hadar, but then realizes the hopelessness of bridging the time/space gap to get to them.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or they are trapped in one of the warp bubbles and are still in the process of trying to evade them.<br />
*Skig heads to the bridge.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(to Malat via the Comm Badge)*: Malat, you should know that there may be three Jem'Hadar fighters that we have to worry about. It looks like the Crazy Horse fled into the system to lose them.<br />
*Hailey Murry heads to the bridge as well*<br />
>Malat pulls up an image on the viewscreen of the coordinates Viraseti provided<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Viraseti's signal came from in there<br />
>♫♫♫Ominous Music Sting♫♫♫<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, to be fair, the Jem'Hadar probably couldn't withstand a longer mission, or being trapped away from a source of Ketracel White. So if William tried to shake them, as long as enough relative time past, withdraw would save them from their immediate attackers.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I'm all for scientific curiousity, but we can't fly the Lister into a binary black hold system to investigate a curious warp signature<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...but don't we have a duty to try and fish out the Crazy Horse?<br />
**Kurij:** How do we fish them out when we have to enter the tar pit alongside them to get them out? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I agree with Zox, if there's a Starfleet ship trapped in there we have a duty to attempt a rescue<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** the 'how' becomes the responsiblity of the entire science team here on the Lister. =D<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We might be able to use those teleportation anomalies to get them out. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I agree with the Captain that if the risk to the Lister is too great, it is best observed from a distance and we should continue with our original mission.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Why am I not surprised<br />
**Kurij:** To be fair, it's actually a reasonable take this time<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Because you are an excellent planner?<br />
*Skig is oblivious to the fact that Bachar just insulted her.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** If we want to attempt a rescue of the Crazy Horse we're going to need a way to do it safely<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I have 11 grandchildren, I wasn't planning to outlive them<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Are we still picking up any of that Traveller signal? <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** So I'm not taking the Lister any closer to the black hole without some way to protect it from the effects of the gravity well<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Just reading the residual warp energy now, the signal seems to have been a short burst within the past day or so<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** localized to the area around the black hole accretion region<br />
*Zox taps his claws.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I sure hope no travelers come and give us sage advice.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Last time I tracked the Traveler's natural warp signature, he was in the Beta quadrant <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I wouldn't count on his help <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm. If light can't escape a black hole, can a ship travelling faster than light escpae it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nominally we could use some sort of Inertial Dampener that would allow us to ride their gravometic waves as they pulse with a minimal risk to the ship at the expense of artificial time dilation resulting in an uneven passage of time between the Lister and normal space?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** ...how much dilation? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The inherent question of subspace and warp space coming in contact with the gravity well of a Black Hole could be catastrophic, which is why our alert systems like to tell us when we get dangerously close to them, per Starfleet SOP.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We're certainly not going to cross any event horizons today<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suspect Viraseti or someone more familiar with space-time dilation metrics could answer that, Counselor.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** And I want a way to avoid any time dilation before I approve any attempted rescue.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Seconded, I don't want to outlive everyone I know<br />
**Ishemok:** Would it be possible to pull the Crazy Horse out of one black hole using the other's gravity? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That is 100% a lie<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You absolutely want to outlive everyone you know<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Just not THAT way<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Have we located where the Crazy Horse is?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Without knowing the location of the ship, figuring out a rescue is a bit of a challenge.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Not precisely, we could attempt to pinpoint its location<br />
*Skig is not sure what everyone is going on about, as long as the Lister outlives her, Skig feels she has done her job.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let's send out some probes and see if we can get additional reads<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 nod in unison*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I believe finding its exact location will greatly assist with the feasibility of whether we can rescue them.<br />
**Kurij:** That is typically how rescues work<br />
>The twins suddenly stop tapping away on their console and collapse to the ground, apparently having some sort of siezure<br />

*Zox thinks that the gravitational fields are just a degenerate form of wrestling, and that somehow this is to be solved by a combination of holds, grabs, and pins.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Medical emergency, Dr. Zerra, to the bridge<br />
*Kolea comes out of the Captain's Ready Room.*<br />
**Kolea:** Let me check on them.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I specifically didn't ask for you, but go ahead<br />
*Kolea kneels down and starts checking the Twins to determine the cause of their medical emergency.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar glares dissaprovingly at Kolea*<br />

**Kolea:** I do recmmend further evaluation, Lt Cmdrs, to avoid a repeat occurence. Unless whatever the big glowy accretion disks things in front of us are definitely a source of concern and a risk to your health, in which case we should properly consider your safety before deciding on a course of action.<br />
*Skig is confused what the Hell Kolea is talking about.*<br />
**GM -> Ishemok:** The Naked Time and Star Trek IV both involve the enterprise time travelling to 20th century earth using a slingshot maneuver (don't ask why or how any of that is supposed to make sense, that was in the days before the show had science advisors)<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, we should certainly consider our physiology before we get too close <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But for now, let's try running that scan again...<br />
**Kolea ** *([over)*: commlink] Dr Zerra, do you have an ETA to the bridge? The situation is under control but I believe they need a more thorough evaluation.<br />
*Dr. Zerra pops out of the turbolift*<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, the distress signal mentioned 3 Jem'Hadar fighters<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That could be Zox<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But they would have to have worked pretty quickly if that is the case, from our perspective they've been trapped in there for years, but for them it's only been a minute or two<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Starfleet is the best, time doesn't change that.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Would an exploding Jem'Hadar ship have caused it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do we have enough of a signal to determine the strength and waveform of the warp signal, an Excelsior class ship will definitely have a much different signature and be larger than Jem'Hadar fighters.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I have no control. Impulse engines offline, warp engines are not responding. We're falling into the gravity well!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Actually Lieutenant, that is a common misconception. It is not the gravity well itself that is the problem until you are nearly inside the event horizon. At this distance, the rotating black hole actually pulls on the spacet...<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** How long do we have until we fall into the black hole?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** At this rate, 12 minutes<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If we take into account the increasing time dilation as we continue on our current trajectory, we will measure it as 12 minutes but an outside observer would actually say we have 60-80 years<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long until we start accruing significant time dilation? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** At this rate of descent, our proper time won't dip below 10% for 8 minutes<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Our current proper time is 91%<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Captain, the gamma ray burst overloaded the primary and most of the secondary EPS conduits, power is still online but unable to transit from the warp core or generators to the engines.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So we've got about 8min to fix that<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Get us out of here Lieutenant<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm trying sir! Impulse engines are not strong enough, and I can't form a stable warp field this close to the black hole<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We're still being pulled in<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But more slowly, Skig's bought us at least a couple of hours<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Suggestions?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we tell how close the other ships are within the gravitational fields? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What if we overclock the warp computer and figure out a variance stabilizing algorithm so we can form stable warp bubbes even with a massive black hole pulling on it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will see if I can modulate the warp field on the Lister to account for the gravitic waves from the event horizon so we can form a warp bubble properly.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I liked Zox's idea also.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Forming a stable warp field in spacetime geometry this curved is incredibly difficult. It would be computationally infeasable to brute-force the necessary equations in the time remaining<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We would need a pre-computed warp field modulation<br />

**Kurij:** The standard procedure for zero-G plasma fires are simultaneous extinguishing from at least 3 positions at 60 degree increments. It's key to approach slowly until the plasma cools enough to condense back into hydrogen gas. At that point, we avoid sparks as best we can until we can suck it up again<br />

**J'Davir:** I have a horrible feeling, as if a pair of Bynars screamed out in terror, and were suddenly silenced.<br />
>MEANWHILE! INTERIOR - Torpedo Room: Zox and his team rush in at a dead sprint, as Zox is very eager to get his torpedos back online in case he needs to kill some Jem'Hadar. When you enter the room, you see Lt. Malat kneeling next to a torpedo which is armed, but undetonated. She has tools in her hands and is frantically working to disarm the torpedo<br />

**Kurij:** Oh no<br />
*Lt. Malat is so focused she doesn't notice Zox and his team enter*<br />

>INTERIOR -Bridge: As the ship continues to be rocked by disruptor blasts, the senior staff all rush back to their posts. Murry's new Jem'Hadar friends are escorted to the bridge on the captain's orders. And the crew must deal with the Jem'Hadar attack before the Lister is reduced to any more of a ruined heap than it already is.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We'll do introductions later, Murry do you think you can get your new friends to stop shooting us?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What happened to my face<br />

**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I would not shed any tears if you all died<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** But I see no reason to go out of my way to kill you<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our comms were destroyed before we left<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hardly a compelling argument, Jem'Hadar don't have tear ducts.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Standard tactical procedure would be to repair weapons, shields and engines before communications<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I have completed my Alpha Quadrant psychographic training module. We have learned to use your idioms and expressions to taunt you and harm your morale<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can we compare notes on that later, I think the order could be optimized.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** No<br />
*Skig has no morale, not sure what he is talking about, so ignores it.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, your loss.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We will be dead<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** and so will you<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that's perhaps not unexpected. I don't suppose we could send a message the hard way? Send out a boarding party to pass it on directly? <br />

*Second B'eor D'Tak pulls out a small device*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We have transporter return beacons<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** But we cannot beam through your shields<br />
**Throk:** THROK VOLUNTEER TO GO TO JEM'HADAR SHIP.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We can't lower the shields, the second we do those Jem'Hadar will obliterate us<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can we make a small enough hole to beam through in a very small window of time?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No problem, if you want to give me that, I can adjust it to bypass our shield modulation without lowering them, then recalibrate the shield modulation to use a different frequency.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Worst case, you splatter like a bug on the inside of a windshield doing Warp 7.<br />
*Zox Is impressed with Skig's pragmatism, as always.*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** You Federations.. Always with your technological solutions<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak hands over the device*<br />
**Throk:** THROK LOVE THESE ODDS!<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I would have lowered the shields, and if we died, we died<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, but I would prefer the ship not take further damage while we are all dying.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** A ship is a tool<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** And your ship is an old piece of shit<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Alpha Quadrang Psychographic training<br />
*Skig looks at Jem'Hadar.*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** To harm morale<br />
*Skig eyes twitch slightly.*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Now do you understand furry one?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Sure.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If I can request to hold back on the proverbial pot shots while we're dealing with the literal ones, that would be fantastic<br />
*Zox appreciates this creature's keen tactical sense, it's _almost_ properly reptilian.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do you know that combined pressure of 7.8 Frenzer on the back of your neck will make you lose total control of your bowels, then puke up all your ketracel white, then beg for forgiveness prior to expiration?<br />
*Skig takes device from Jem'Hadar and reconfigures it.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To Harm Morale.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Jem'Hadar do not beg, and we do not seek your forgiveness<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That remains to be seen.<br />

**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Four, it is only meant to take me and my men<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I'm coming with you then<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I won't order someone else to beam into a Jem'Hadar ship alone<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Besides, if they don't stop shooting we're all dead anyways<br />
**Throk:** Throk think it not best idea for honourable Captain to die horribly alone away from loving grandchildren as Lister is sucked into Event Horizon.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Why do you spend so much time complaining about your deaths?<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Prepare yourself<br />
**Throk:** Throk think Murry already proven to have both mental good smarts and psychotic brutality to adapt well to Jem'Hadar lifestyle.<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak pulls out the transponder and stands next to the captain*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We can either prepare ourselves for it as if it's inevetable or take action to change things<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I can go with you, captain, if there's no objections. <br />
*Skig scribbles down note for Throk to be the next ship counselor if Murry dies.*<br />

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Ishemok): Throkk is a walking Cheshire Fourth Wall</font><br />

*Second B'eor D'Tak activates the transporter beacon with Captain Baras, Hailey Murry and Throk*<br />
>The bridge of the Jem'Hadar ship is even more of a mess than the Lister, as the Jem'Hadar seem to have foregone all repair efforts except for the weapons and tactical systems<br />

>Damaged optical lines, severed power lines, and ruptured EPS conduits are strewn about the deck. <br />

*Ishemok considers trying to sell packets of non-dairy coffee creamer as ketracel white to the Jem'Hadar.*<br />
>When the away team materializes, nearby Jem'Hadar pull out their disruptors immediately<br />

**First Taran K'lor:** What is the meaning of this, you are supposed to die before you are captured<br />
*Throk does not reciprocate, as "We come in peace" seems to have been the expected response.*<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak pulls out his own disruptor and holds it to Murry's head*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** As you can see, I have not been captured<br />
**Throk:** I agree, mighty Jem'Hadar warrior definitely not captured.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** But there are some... developments that you must know of<br />
**Throk:** Also true.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Human, speak<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak puts the data crystal containing Murry's historical records into the computer so the First can see*<br />
*Throk offers ketracel white coated popcorn to nearest Jem'Hadar who is not labeled "First" or "Second.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The time dilation caused by the black hole means that you're a few years behind. With your permission, your second in command has records for the results of the war and the armistace<br />

**Throk:** Throk have several knives to assist if people need pointed death. Even have Poinard for Murry Poignant death scene.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** I doubt your veracity<br />
*First Taran K'lor puts his disruptor away*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Second, you will stay with this captain<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** If they betray us, kill him<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Victory is life<br />
**Throk:** Throk can vouch for Captain, Captain have absolutely no veracitic genes in entire DNA system, only geriatric ones.<br />

**Throk:** Throk only know, Kolea OnlyFans has 40x the subscriber viewership of this show. He must work as Night Shift Security Guard in Museum to pay bills. Maybe some day movie get made about this.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Well thank you Mr. Throk, for bringing the Commander back<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** You're dismissed, this is a senior staff briefing. As to that: what's our next move?<br />
*Throk leaves when instructed.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We still have a second Jem'Hadar fighter and the Crazy out there<br />
*Kolea goes off to render "first aid" as needed.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Have we should hail the Crazy Horse already? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our wing had three fighters, not two<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Have we hailed the Crazy Horse already? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They are currently still outside our warp bubble<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailing the Crazy Horse would be very difficult, considering warp logistics and our own subspace bubble.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They are still experiencing high levels of time dilation, and will continue to do so until we get close enough<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so not much of a chance for them to come swooping in. How are the repairs coming along? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have maneuvering thrusters, so movement at any speed in any direction is problematic.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our ship has engines, but our warp core is destroyed. We must remain inside your warp bubble or become trapped again<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And fixing that is going to require taking the warp drives offline, which will cause us to get stuck in the same time dilation we were trying to avoid.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Although this seems cold blooded, it may be best to prioritize the Lister and whatever Jem'Hadar ships to safety before recovering the Crazy Horse and Missing Fighter #3. Time dialation means a fully fit vessel may recover them later at less risk.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we get ourselves out of the gravity well with just the maneuvering thrusters? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In approximately... 114 years<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ugh<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we get ourselves to the Crazy Horse? <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I agree with Zox, we need to rescue ourselves before we worry about the Crazy Horse and the other Jem'Hadar<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It isn't quite that simple sir. Orbital mechanics don't allow that<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We can't move in arbitrary directions this deep in the gravity well with only impulse<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There's no path we can take to get out of the gravity that won't cause our warp bubble to intersect the Crazy Horse and the other Jem'Hadar fighter<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have no sensors, our superstructure is crippled without serious repair options. Impulse and Warp I might be able to cobble something together for a short period of time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would it expedite or enable repairs if the Jem'Hadar abandon one of their attack vessels as salvage and come aboard the Lister?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Brutal, cold blooded lizard reality?<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We have engines and weapons, but our sensors and shields are completely destroyed<br />

**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I do not know if our systems are compatible enough that you could repair your ship with our parts<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Our best option might be to see what we can cobble together from scavenging parts off the Jem'Hadar fighter to get the Lister able to reach the Crazy Horse as we drift in that direction.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** And First Taran K'lor is not about to allow that without a fight<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is there only one other Jem'Hadar ship in here? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our attack wing had three <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do you mean to say that he would not allow that, or that we would have to duel him first? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Moments before you arrived, one of our ships dissapeared from our scopes<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We assumed you had destroyed them<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yah but you aren't going to find a glorious end against either boredom or a black hole. Your best bet is getting out of this.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hold on, when you say moments, do you mean seconds or minutes? <br />

**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Yes<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Impulse power<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You are inside our warp bubble<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We were attracted to the system here because we detected a Traveller-style warp bubble signature. It's possible that they got pulled out by someone or something else before we arrived. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But he said it was a Starfleet warp signature, if it was a Starfleet ship why would they rescue a Jem'Hadar fighter and not the Crazy Horse?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** 's ears begin to leak smoke as he contemplates time-paradoxes<br />
*Zox 's ears begin to leak smoke as he contemplates time-paradoxes*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Insufficient information.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, Franken-ship time. We have functional shuttlecraft we can deploy and attach to the Jem'Hadar ship via magenetic grapples. They can use their sensors to feed the Jem'Hadar fighter and the Lister with what they can pick up. The Jem'Hadar fighter will pull the Lister via tractor beam to keep the entire collection of Orky Space Hulk within the Time Dilation Bubble. Then we push towards the position of the Crazy Horse.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I agree with Zox, let's file that away under "fascinating but not relevant to our current predicament"<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** At the point where we have a functional Crazy Horse to work with, we can revisit how to get everyone out of the Black Hole gravitic fields, assuming they are not comparably damaged and we are all stuck scavenging for making an even larger Orky Space Hulk.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Skig that may be the craziest plan you have suggested yet. And I am including the ones where you want to sacrifice the crew to save the ship<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Do you have a better idea?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Which is closer to us, the Crazy Horse or the other Jem'Hadar ship? <br />
*Cmdr Bachar grumbles*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think it is up to the captain to decide, but we should save ourselves and send in a more capable ship to rescue the Crazy Horse, which has been stuck here for years<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We currently have no working sensors, but last time we had a positional scan the Jem'Hadar fighter was aft of the Crazy Horse, 60,000 km nearer to us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we can get within range of the Crazy Horse, it can do a better job pulling us. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We'll need to get within comms range and somehow convince both ships not to fire before they blast us out of the sky<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, we can convince the Crazy Horse, but Second B'eor D'Tak or First Taran K'lor would be best to convince the last Jem'Hadar Vessel<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Correct. I think a Jem'Hadar ship towing the Lister would probably give them reason to pause<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Also, it's easy to get a signal to the Crazy Horse, I've already calculated a way to time it to hit when our warp bubble intersects theirs.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though I'm not sure about the Crazy Horse. <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our ship will ignore any comms from your vessel, and our communications are destroyed<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I sent a distress signal 2.5 scenes ago, as is compliant with Star Fleet Policy on entering deadly combat unilaterally.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I will beam to their bridge and order them to stand down, and if they do not I will kill their First and take command<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Superb!<br />
*Throk wishes he was there, because that is exactly how a Gorn would do it also and he would 100% support this plan.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We can send a second signal to overlap to the first quite easily. We just need to start working on repairs.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Ok, we're probably going to all die together, but Skig's crazy idea is the only one I've heard<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** So let's get moving<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I was hoping someone had a better idea.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Who is piloting the shuttle craft to provide the sensor relay?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): If only we had rolled up a large number of pilots.... oh wait...</font><br />
**Ishemok:** Pilot, Ready for Orders!<br />
**Mowus:  [d20 = 9]**<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Let's get moving, get 2 pilots to the shuttles, and we'll need someone on comms to send an update to the Crazy Horse. <br />
**Kurij:** Ready to pilot as well! <br />
*Ishemok looks at Skig *<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Great meeting, let's try not to die in the next 10 minutes<br />
*Throk is not convinced that request is at all achievable.*<br />

*Hailey Murry downs the rest of her coffee*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** During Operation Whalesong, the USS Farragut was able to generate forward thrust using a gravitic pulse "sail" generated by mylar fibroids reconstituted through the replicators in order to pull themselves out of a gravitic well and closer to the nearest source of light.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This was after their warp core and impulse was knocked off line by the alien probe which shorted out the entire EPS system beyond repair.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The accretion disk is far too dense with material for a solar sail to work, but actually it isn't crazy to try to harness the angular momentum of the material in the accretion disk itself<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Your sail would have to be orders of magnitude stronger than a mylar solar sail though<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It would be encountering violent pressure differentials and high velocity shear between layers of the accreted material<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Viraseti, your idea of "isn't crazy" and mine are very different<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We really only have two directions we can go right now; in or out<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well Bachar, my three other options involve (a) disabling the inertial dampeners on the torpedo tubes, spinning the Lister around, and using shudder effect to push it. I predict a 5% change of success. (b) Recalibrating photon torpedoes into boarding launchers and sending people to the Crazy Horse by using burrowing torpedoes. (c) Rigging a warp generator to Old Faithless and trying to punt it to the Crazy Horse.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm an engineer, not a scientist.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Option B sounds fun<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's good, your species is not known for immortality.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** All right Viraseti, so Old Faithless is a bit peculiar of a shuttle craft. It was originally built as a prototype during a summer project by Chief Montgomery Scott and I inherited it after Starfleet's Museum was going to mothball it from the Exhibit of "How Not to Do Things" after their Jury-Rigging class was cancelled by demand of the Admiralty.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Right, so does it have a warp core? Or life support?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So, there are a few quirks you need to know. First, you have to press the second side panel on the right with your left thumb while holding down that elevated pressure plate with your right foot or main power does not come online.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...that reminds me, I should probably put a new windshield on this.<br />

**T'Kor:** It's quite a comfort, really<br />
**Mowus:** Can you at least put a sign on it that says, do not eat before riding?<br />
>As the staff are discussing the sorry state of Skig's inexplicably favorite shuttlecraft, First Taran K'lor comes into the mess, drawing uneasy looks from most of the crew present<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I got the idea for using the disrupters as maneuvering thrusters while winning a drinking contest with some Klingon engineers.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It actually kind of worked<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hail First Taran K'lor<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** although you have to be careful not to disintigrate anyone to your left or right when maneuvering<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Greetings lizard creature<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** I have confirmed with the Dominion ambasador on Deep Space 9 that the war is indeed over<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** So I am dissapointed I will not be able to kill any of you<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I was actually wondering if it could be used for close assault support during orbital insertions but vaporising defensive forces through maneuvering.<br />
**Throk:** Throk feel Jem'Hadar man not going to have to wait long, only matter of time before we kill selves.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** This one looks frail and weak, but these two look like a challenge<br />
*First Taran K'lor points at Murry, then Throk and Zox, as he speaks*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Now that we are not enemies, tell me: were you lying about the fate of my third attack craft?<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest not underestiimate small hairless one, she saw Jem'Hadar heads off with cooking utensils and use heads as puppets, calls it therapy.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** You claimed that you saw only 2, and did not destroy it, but was that merely a lie to pacify me?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We do not lie.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not at all, we're not exactly sure what happened to it. However, we were initially responding to a strange warp signature. I think someone may have pulled your third ship out of the gravity well before we arrived. <br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Who would do that?<br />
*Throk mimics Murry using a Jem'Hadar's stuffed head to speak.*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Why rescue one ship and leave 3 others behind?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possible they were knocked into the event horizon<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possible they never quite fell in<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Perhaps<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Im sure you can find out more when you reach a Dominion Base.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why, indeed...<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps the ship that was "rescued" was captured for experimentation by superior alien species interested in determining combat techniques of ferocious and honorable Jem'Hadar, surely they are strongest threat predatory invaders would face?<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** That seems... fanciful<br />
**Throk:** Throk have brochure.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** We may not be enemies any longer, but would you consent to a "training" battle, lizard man?<br />
*Throk makes popcorn.*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** I am dissapointed to have missed the chance to face you in battle<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure it was by a superior alien species, but the warp signature we got is one that's not typically active in these areas<br />
*Zox gets up out of his chair and stands tall and puffed up!*<br />
*Skig tosses Zox a Luchador mask.*<br />
*First Taran K'lor flips the table (with everyone's drinks on it) out of the way and adopts a fighting stance*<br />
**Throk:** Throk not betting person, but thinks this good opportunity for Murry to fleece crewmates.<br />
**Zox: [ FITNESS  (9) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 1]

**Zox:  [d20 = 14]**<br />
>Zox puts up a valiant effor, but First Taran K'lor gets the upper hand and is able to throw Zox up over his shoulders and slam him through another table full of drinks<br />

**First Taran K'lor:** Most pleasing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Verily, you have earned the title of First<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Perhaps if the Federation had more of your kind they would be a true threat to the Dominion<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Until we meet again lizard man. <br />
*First Taran K'lor salutes Zox and leaves*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I look forward to the rematch!<br />
*Cmdr Bachar comes running in with a phaser rifle and a security team behind her*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What the hell...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I had a report that one of the Jem'Hadar was attacking Zox<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's fine<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That is the only way their species communicates =D<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have built rapport with their first.<br />
**Zox: [ PRESENCE  (10) +  COMMAND  (2)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 20]**<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Well do me a favor and build rapport in the gym or the holodeck next time<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We have enough of a mess on this ship without you contributing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Jem'Hadar would not accept such synthetic conditions in a true martial test<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** He may not, but you will or I'm putting a reprimand in your file<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Is that clear, Lieutenant Commander?<br />
**Zox: [ PRESENCE  (10) +  SCIENCE  (4)]

*Cmdr Bachar slings her phaser rifle and dissmisses the security team.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** This posting is going to be the end of me<br />
*Cmdr Bachar sighs and leaves*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wow, well done sir<br />
*Zox Mops up the spilled liquor with a potted plant and begins chewing on it.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah....perfection.<br />
>♫♫♫Lighthearted Music Sting♫♫♫<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Normally when she yells at me I get assigned to maintenance shifts for a week<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Jem'Hadar may understand only violence, but management always understands bullshit.<br />

**Throk:** Zox carries the wisdom of many generations of lizard.<br />
