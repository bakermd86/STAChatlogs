>Captain's log, Stardate 61420.9: We have diverted from our diplomatic mission to Sulani IV at the request of Lt. Cmdr Viraseti. She asked me to call a briefing of the senior staff so she can explain what this is all about. She says it is urgent, so I have approved her request to divert even though I don't yet know what this is all about. I hope she isn't wasting my time, I would like to imagine a starfleet officer would never do that, but with this crew you can never be too sure...<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Lt. Cmdr Viraseti connects her PADD to the briefing room monitor and pulls up a diagram view of a globular cluster at a fourier transform.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ever since our encounter with the Traveler from Tau Alpha C I have been working with colleagues at the Argus array to monitor for his unique warp signature.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have been researching the nature of his warp field manipulations, hoping it could be put to some good use. But a few hours ago we detected something very strange.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Always a good sign<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I detected a matching signature in a nearby globular cluster, but this one had a markedly different subspace spectrum. It looked like an attempt to replicate the sort of warp bubbles that the Traveler created using a conventional warp engine.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The cluster is less than 20 light years away from our course, so I asked the captain if we can divert to investigate. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It shouldn't add much delay to our mission, and the potential scientific value is immense<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** ...So...either smugglers or an uncharted civilization wants to be as cool as the Traveler?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** And it's pretty much guaranteed that whoever it is had access to information on the Traveler? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Possibly, I am hoping to get a better reading of the residual warp energy when we are closer to the signal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, that is a safe bet<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I would recommend reconfiguring Modular Laboratory 4 next to the Port Sensor arrays to take better advantage of the warp bubble signatures. The starboard side array has been failing higher level diagnostics and keeps switching to a Klingon Opera Playlist.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
*Zox acts innocent.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Do we have any information on Starfleet operations in the area that might be engaged in some technical testing we might not be normally privvy to?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Viraseti, do we have an approximate size of the warp bubbles and do they have subspace eddies that may interfere with our warp bubble within a certain range?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** One has to assume someone would want to use the Traveler's abilities for a military purpose.<br />
*Lt. Malat nods in agreement. *<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** History has conclusively proven that all inventions stem from military need or Rule 34.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** At our current range, I can't say much as to the topology of the warp bubble<br />
*Skig checks script to see if that is what her line was supposed to be. Decides later to to a web search on Rule 34 and figure out what that means.*<br />

*Ishemok beep boop beep, patching...*<br />
>Ishemok pulls up a frequency analysis of a far-infrared radio signal he has been receiving from the same direction as Viraseti's warp bubble signal<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** If the communications signal is not baroque, don't fix it.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** No way it could be a comm signal, it's old-fashioned radio, light speed only<br />

>Skig routes the signal into the comms, a strange, periodic pop is heard from the speakers, but nothing else<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think the dress uniform looks quite good on you, Lt Malat, it's a shame you don't get the opportunity to wear it more often<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Nonsense Malat, the fluted skirt looks fine on you. At least you to do not have hairy tree trunk legs.<br />
*Lt. Malat looks visibly annoyed*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well we've been reading the signal continuously for the past 8 minutes<br />
*Skig checks to see if Malat has done anything worthy of being thrown in the brig to avoid having to wear her dress uniform. Cannot find anything specific, but decides to mention that option later when fewer people are around.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** How long since the faux Traveler signal? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And at our current warp factor, that means the signal has been transmitting continuously for several years at least<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** And? Do they bring peace or war?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Because we have covered 3.6 light years since Ensign Ishemok first detected it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** If the signal is getting stronger, it is safe to posit they are being generated by the warp bubbles?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If it is a comms signal, then they certainly have a lot to say<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** What if they are putting radio signals IN warp bubbles if they haven not yet discovered subspace? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Interesting hypothesis, an attempt to reproduce faster-than-light communications via radio signals in warp bubbles? It may be possible, but it seems much more difficult than ordinary subspace communication<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** However, if the goal was to communicate with something inside the warp bubble that did not have access to modern communication equipment, that might be feasible. Remember that Murry said this was a Federation Comm signal.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** It certainly seems like one, yes. What do the records say about the last vessel in this area? <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not necessarily, spatial curvature can be caused by any large gravity well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Would the warp bubbles and temporal distortion have been something that the USS Baton Rouge would have mentioned during their survey, though? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** It seems that perhaps it was more passive? And now is more active for some reason? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** True, although the fact radio waves are escaping it reduces the risk of various spectral phenomena like interstital black holes and light absorbing gravity wells.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well a radio signal could still originate near a black hole, it would just be red-shifted<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I agree with the Captain that if the risk to the Lister is too great, it is best observed from a distance and we should continue with our original mission.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** To be fair, it's actually a reasonable take this time<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Because you are an excellent planner?<br />
*Skig is oblivious to the fact that Bachar just insulted her.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** If we want to attempt a rescue of the Crazy Horse we're going to need a way to do it safely<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** I have 11 grandchildren, I wasn't planning to outlive them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Are we still picking up any of that Traveller signal? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** So I'm not taking the Lister any closer to the black hole without some way to protect it from the effects of the gravity well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Just reading the residual warp energy now, the signal seems to have been a short burst within the past day or so<br />

*Zox taps his claws.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I sure hope no travelers come and give us sage advice.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Last time I tracked the Traveler's natural warp signature, he was in the Beta quadrant <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I wouldn't count on his help <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Hrm. If light can't escape a black hole, can a ship travelling faster than light escpae it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Nominally we could use some sort of Inertial Dampener that would allow us to ride their gravometic waves as they pulse with a minimal risk to the ship at the expense of artificial time dilation resulting in an uneven passage of time between the Lister and normal space?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** ...how much dilation? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** The inherent question of subspace and warp space coming in contact with the gravity well of a Black Hole could be catastrophic, which is why our alert systems like to tell us when we get dangerously close to them, per Starfleet SOP.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** We're certainly not going to cross any event horizons today<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I suspect Viraseti or someone more familiar with space-time dilation metrics could answer that, Counselor.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** And I want a way to avoid any time dilation before I approve any attempted rescue.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Seconded, I don't want to outlive everyone I know<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ishemok.png" alt="Ishemok" width="50" height="50">**Ishemok:** Would it be possible to pull the Crazy Horse out of one black hole using the other's gravity? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** That is 100% a lie<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** You absolutely want to outlive everyone you know<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** Just not THAT way<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Have we located where the Crazy Horse is?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Without knowing the location of the ship, figuring out a rescue is a bit of a challenge.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Not precisely, we could attempt to pinpoint its location<br />
*Skig is not sure what everyone is going on about, as long as the Lister outlives her, Skig feels she has done her job.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Let's send out some probes and see if we can get additional reads<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 nod in unison*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I believe finding its exact location will greatly assist with the feasibility of whether we can rescue them.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kurij.png" alt="Kurij" width="50" height="50">**Kurij:** That is typically how rescues work<br />
>The twins suddenly stop tapping away on their console and collapse to the ground, apparently having some sort of siezure<br />

*Zox thinks that the gravitational fields are just a degenerate form of wrestling, and that somehow this is to be solved by a combination of holds, grabs, and pins.*<br />

>INTERIOR - Bridge: The Lister rocks violetly as the emergency lighting kicks in and the Red Alert klaxon begins to blare momentarily before they fall silent as main power fails. As the rocking subsides, the only sound is the crackle of burning EPS conduits, as the acrid smell of melting polymers and burnt hair fill the bridge<br />

Murry's new Jem'Hadar friends are escorted to the bridge on the captain's orders. And the crew must deal with the Jem'Hadar attack before the Lister is reduced to any more of a ruined heap than it already is.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Hailing the Crazy Horse would be very difficult, considering warp logistics and our own subspace bubble.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They are still experiencing high levels of time dilation, and will continue to do so until we get close enough<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so not much of a chance for them to come swooping in. How are the repairs coming along? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We have maneuvering thrusters, so movement at any speed in any direction is problematic.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our ship has engines, but our warp core is destroyed. We must remain inside your warp bubble or become trapped again<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** And fixing that is going to require taking the warp drives offline, which will cause us to get stuck in the same time dilation we were trying to avoid.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Although this seems cold blooded, it may be best to prioritize the Lister and whatever Jem'Hadar ships to safety before recovering the Crazy Horse and Missing Fighter #3. Time dialation means a fully fit vessel may recover them later at less risk.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Can we get ourselves out of the gravity well with just the maneuvering thrusters? <br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** I agree with Zox, we need to rescue ourselves before we worry about the Crazy Horse and the other Jem'Hadar<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** It isn't quite that simple sir. Orbital mechanics don't allow that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** We can't move in arbitrary directions this deep in the gravity well with only impulse<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** There's no path we can take to get out of the gravity that won't cause our warp bubble to intersect the Crazy Horse and the other Jem'Hadar fighter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We have no sensors, our superstructure is crippled without serious repair options. Impulse and Warp I might be able to cobble something together for a short period of time.<br />

We have functional shuttlecraft we can deploy and attach to the Jem'Hadar ship via magenetic grapples. They can use their sensors to feed the Jem'Hadar fighter and the Lister with what they can pick up. The Jem'Hadar fighter will pull the Lister via tractor beam to keep the entire collection of Orky Space Hulk within the Time Dilation Bubble. Then we push towards the position of the Crazy Horse.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CmdrBachar.PNG" alt="Cmdr Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Cmdr Bachar:** I agree with Zox, let's file that away under "fascinating but not relevant to our current predicament"<br />

*Cmdr Bachar grumbles*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think it is up to the captain to decide, but we should save ourselves and send in a more capable ship to rescue the Crazy Horse, which has been stuck here for years<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We currently have no working sensors, but last time we had a positional scan the Jem'Hadar fighter was aft of the Crazy Horse, 60,000 km nearer to us<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** If we can get within range of the Crazy Horse, it can do a better job pulling us. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtMalat.PNG" alt="Lt. Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Malat:** We'll need to get within comms range and somehow convince both ships not to fire before they blast us out of the sky<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Well, we can convince the Crazy Horse, but Second B'eor D'Tak or First Taran K'lor would be best to convince the last Jem'Hadar Vessel<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Correct. I think a Jem'Hadar ship towing the Lister would probably give them reason to pause<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Also, it's easy to get a signal to the Crazy Horse, I've already calculated a way to time it to hit when our warp bubble intersects theirs.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Though I'm not sure about the Crazy Horse. <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our ship will ignore any comms from your vessel, and our communications are destroyed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I sent a distress signal 2.5 scenes ago, as is compliant with Star Fleet Policy on entering deadly combat unilaterally.<br />
