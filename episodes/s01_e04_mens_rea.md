>Captain's Log, Stardate 61165.8: Due to extensive, unexplained hull breaches on deck 8 after the Lister's infestation, we have had to divert to the nearest Federation dry-dock facility on Skana-IV to repair the damage.
While the repairs are performed, I have ordered the crew to take some shore leave in the planet's equatorial area.
Most of the crew were happy for the time off, but Commander Skig was... shall we say passionate about overseeing the repairs. I asked Zox to keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn't sneak back onto the Lister to work during her leave.<br />

>INTERIOR - Madau Casino: Zox, Skig and Murry have gone to the casino with Zerra and the twins. Dr. Zerra read some book on Dabo and is convinced he has a perfect system to beat the house. The twins have accompanied him, as they are convinced he does not.<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'm telling you, with the right betting strategy Dabo is actually a very simple game. You two are going to eat your words.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not question that Dabo is a simple game. So simple in fact that we can prove quite easily that the house has a 7% advantage, regardless of your "strategy"<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, maybe not regardless of the strategy<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But you've got to be very careful about that<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Correct, you can always give the house a greater advantage<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I hope you lose early and consolidate your loss, otherwise you may confuse luck for skill.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ye of little faith<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You are correct, we have no faith to speak of<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, sorry, what were we discussing?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nothing quite breaks the mind better than arriving at something for the wrong reasons.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Gamblin!<br />
*Dr. Zerra places several bets on the Dabo table*<br />
*Skig tries to surrepitiously hide her tricoder's auto-relay of from the Lister's repair terminal.*<br />
*Skig whistles in a very, "I'm guilty and can't even fake hiding it" way.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Do you find this form of recreation enjoyable Commander?<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 speaking to Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Aww, I understand you Skig. But if you want to have some fun with engineering, watch this poor Dr. break a mental circuit. It could be fun!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Dr Zerra, where did you get the funds for this?<br />
**Dabo Girl:** Last call, all bets are final!<br />
*Dabo Girl spins the Dabo wheel*<br />

>Zox has chosen poorly<br />

*Skig makes mental note to never trust Zox or Zerra with money.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is truly astonishing how quickly you both lost your money<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I knew I should have listened to that Ferengi selling timeshares....that would have been a good investment.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, im sure these rooms have a lot of 'Action' going on in them, can you hack into the camera feed?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possibly run a scan to see how much transporter activity has occured in this space?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... I wonder if this part of some strange human mating ritual, like Hailey did recently?<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Zerra, could you canvas the area for any residual nucleic acid residues?<br />

**Nameless, faceless security guard:** Oh, ok. It's my first day, so I don't want to get fired again<br />
>Skig receives a link to her PADD containing surveilance footage from level 14<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What's the matter Hailey, insufficient human mating activity?<br />
>Hailey Murry kneels down to investigate a black score mark on the deck near the bed. It is approximately 1/2 meter across, and smells slightly of burnt hair<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What could have cuased this?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am reading humanoid DNA here. It looks like someone was vaporized here with a disruptor...<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The DNA is damaged beyond recognition, even with the scanners in sickbay I wouldn't be able to identify it<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It could be Human, but it could also be one of a dozen other species<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Damn this 24th Century technology!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Most DNA evidence turned out to be faulty in Tellerite judicial court, so I'm not sure how useful it would be.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Now we will be agonized if Bachar vaped someone while being abucted, or was herself vaped!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I doubt Bachar was carrying a disrupter, likely it was one of the Naussicans who broke into her room after they beamed into the hallway.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Naussicans? <br />
*Skig states this while contemplating the decorative vase on the table.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What is it with Naussicans and gambling related violence.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Normally I would assume Bachar is carrying a disruptor, but given that she is on shore leave, I would suspect only a type-2 phaser instead.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There was also an Orion woman with them, which was likely the leader of the group, given Orion control of various syndicates.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But is Bachar OK!?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The footage is inconclusive, as it does not include interior room events.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is there any way you can have the Lister prevent any ships from leaving orbit?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, there is a 132.87263 second gap in the footage, which means the security system here is compromised, and whoever has done it is likely listening to our conversation.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The lister is in dry dock, it couldn't prevent a shuttle from leaving orbit<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'll want to talk to the Captain, I think. He may have some clues about her previous postings<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Lister is bowed but never unready!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, there is a captain of a Federation starship, who could request immediate ship-lock of port control.<br />
*Zox Slaps his in communicator badge in a forceful yet dignified fashion*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Captain Baras, requesting a cessation of all outgoing orbital traffic immediately!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** 11, 10, can you do a trace on the transporter? Skig, can you point out where the Orion Woman and Naussicans transported in at?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh my stars, I'll call it in as soon as I find my pants<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** But I'll need an explanation after my massage<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes Captain!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Interesting, the transporter trace does not appear to be leaving the surface. It reads as a point-to-point transport to another continent north of here<br />
**Kolea:** But Captain, are you sure you want me to stop what I'm currently doing and let you get your pants back?<br />

**Kolea:** Captain, would you like some anal kontis?<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I could fire you, you know<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Someone pinpoint that location and lets pursue!<br />
*Kolea says something which is heavily bleeped, even on Cinemax at 0200.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, I think it's pretty safe to say that Bachar is okay. They would have vaporized her to being with if they'd wanted to kill her and get ird of the body<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** To Antal Konis!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Apologies Commander, but I am not able to pinpoint the transporter trace to a specific location. I can narrow it down to a city on the northern continent though<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There are a number of locations dedicated to the chemist Antal Konis, unless the people in question were planning to hang out in a public meeting room in a library none of them would require reservations.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** HRM<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is the Chemist still alive? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However, we should be able to investigate them rather easily to determine where our Naussican quarry went.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, but he is the only person who is followed by Neraran's Twitter account.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wonder what a bunch of bad people would want with a Federation Commander....Computer, what is the most secure location in Antal Konis that a commander would be needed to grant access?<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so whoever took Bachar's place knew what Dr Malov was researching beforehand. They definitely did the secret duplication of shapechanger goo, you can see her apply it here and one of her goons activate the machine behind the doctor's back. <br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or Jasanis is the Shapeshifter or has been replaced by the Shapeshifter. But this gives us something to start with.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But what is so special about this lab that they would bother breaking in?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Just to use a chemical printer?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox, if we know we are looking for an Orion woman named Jasanis, would this be a good time to initiate a planetwide security scan to locate all Orion pheromone signatures?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What is the connection between Ketracel White and Changelings? <br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Hailey Murry): Delete that one lol</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Those are great questions, Dr. Zerra, if no one else has a suggestion I can review the manufacturing details to determine what makes this special.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Please.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So it looks like these printers aren't mechanically special, any printers can do the same things. However, these printers were being used to research production on Ketracel White, so anything specific to the Starfleet's research of the drug would need this specific machine<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's the software, not the hardware<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good thing I made a backup before I injected the TURBO-EXLAX Malware. Although, forcing all Gem-Hadar to suffer from extreme Taco Bell overingestion to the point of dehydration is not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Above sentence paid for by Taco Bell competitors</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That doesn't make any sense, why would a founder need to co-opt Federation research on Ketracel White? The Founders already produce the stuff, they invented it!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Perhaps to stop our research into it?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Simple sabotage?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Could be, they did kill Dr. Malov<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Right, I doubt this is being done in the spirit of cooperation with the Federation to liberate the Gem-Hadar from their dependency on the Founders.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But the intruder still left with 800ml of something from the printer. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes, that. What did they have to produce? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And we need to track that down if we can't find it.<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Fake Ketracel White to rile up the Gem-Hadar that the Federation is trying to kill them?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, how did they know about what was being researched here? It was top secret. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wish Neraran was here. This would be a puzzle she'd be most adept at piecing together.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed, no record of this research is evident at our clearance level<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I will cancel shore leave for the senior staff and file a report to Starfleet command. I can't imagine it will reflect well on our service record for the first officer to be kidnapped...<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Thank you for cleaning my face.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, canceling the senior staff shore leave to address this problem is likely quite important.<br />

*Captain Baras sighs*<br />
*Zox pulls out his 'little book of starfleet regulations'*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Alright, then go find this shapeshifter. Hopefully it leads you to Bachar<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I shall remember to notify you in the future as the needs warrant captain. This is a failure on my part and I accept full responsibility.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I will round up the senior staff and get them back to Lister. Hopefully we can get critical systems back online to assist from there<br />

**Security Officer:** No one move! Security systems detected a shapeshifter infiltration!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The Shapeshifter went out the window, but sure, have us all stand here while the murderous Shapeshifter who disintegrated Dr. Malov gets away.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so we should discuss what to do with Commander Bachar’s credentials. Do we want to disable them entirely or flag them?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Standard procedure would be to honeypot them into a useless location that would trap her account to log her location.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr. Zerra, let’s check these for evidence that may help us figure out where they came from or where they are going.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** This is unusual. Both Naussicans have signs of low level radiation poisoning<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did it get the chance to print anything?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The log indicates it printed approximately 800ml of something<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We may be able to reconstruct the chemical signature from the encoded memory files if the buffer was not cleared, which it might not have been if it was in the printing process when we interrupted them.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** After feeding the voice signatures through an extensive database, I have determined that a wanted Orion Criminal by the name is Jasanis is in cahoots with this shapeshifter.<br />

*Zox Log, Stardate 1337.420

Leisurely browsing on the posh luxuries of Skana-IV has made for a very thorny experience.
It seems the weeds of Commander Bachar's felonious past have sprouted again, forcing us
to pursue her captors. Rather than finding the typical sleazeweasels that inhabit gambling
emporia, we have caught scent of a larger plot involving a changeling, the Orion
Syndicate, and the manufacture of some rather impressive bootleg Ketracel White. After
an explosive research find, we prepare a new away team to find one Orion, Jasanis.
After this mission, I must send fresh greens to Rhuk and check in with the Malari authorities
to make sure Neraran is not causing too much trouble.*<br />

*Kolea sniffs the area.*<br />
**Kolea:** Well, if it was not burned too badly, possibly.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think it's just Jurassic Musk. Rhuk gifte it to me in the hopes I wouldn't attract more humans.<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, I do indeed smell the husky odour of a very manly and strong dinosaur.<br />
**Kolea:** That was cooked.<br />

**Kolea:** I was charged with that once, it involved mistaking chicken based cooking oil for massage oil in a heated room.<br />
**Kolea:** Hmm... I do remember someone named Jasanis. She is a vile seductress who believes heavily in the "love them and leave them to die in the vacuum of space with a limited amount of oxygen" approach to mating.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well darn that's some luck.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...that you know of her, not the poor people she seduced.<br />
**Kolea:** Also, she has a slightly modified pheromone signature that tends to cause females to get splitting headaches and behave irrationally, thereby inducing their mates to leave them.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So complicated. Why can't you just decorate a hole in the ground with vegetation and do the dance of many stomps?<br />
**Kolea:** And she also thinks Starfleet Vessels are piles of floating scrap that should be destroyed.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's it! Nuking the planet from orbit.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** (Just kidding)<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well based on her rap sheet, the only part of a Starfleet vessel she has ever seen is the inside of a brig<br />
*Zox looks for iodone pills in the lab wreckage*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not their best feature if you ask me<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So...what would she be doing kidnapping a Starfleet officer and getting caught up with shapeshifters?<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, the jail cells do not make for very mood appropriate bondage chambers, but they have nice open force fields which allow for performance work without the risk of being slobbered on.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well, she's got a lot of drug charges here. Does Ketracel White have any value as a street drug?<br />

**Kolea:** While it has not been tested much on others, Ketracel White can cause hallucinations in other species, as well as various physical stimulae. I'm not sure it would be incredibly useful as a street drug, but given its highly addictive nature getting people hooked on something hard to produce and therefore expensive would be a possible business opportunity.<br />
**Kolea:** At least, as people like Jasanis consider "business opportunities".<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well I doubt she plans to start a drug running empire with 800ml of the stuff<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She must have some plan to synthesize more<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But she probably has the expertise to make more with these machines.<br />
**Kolea:** I doubt it, but this type of planet would make for a good test bed for "trial runs" of the material as well as increasing production.<br />
*Zox slaps his coms badge.*<br />
**Kolea:** Resort planets are good places to test out new "merchandise".<br />
*Zox Skig. Where on this planet are more of these replicator, fabricator, thing-dingies? The ones that were in this lab. I have these serial numbers and the manufacturers name as well.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig. Where on this planet are more of these replicator, fabricator, thing-dingies? The ones that were in this lab. I have these serial numbers and the manufacturers name as well.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm. So, if they came all the way out here for it, I don't think they've got a supply themselves. How many doses is 800mL of ketracel white? <br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So using the normal dosage of Ketracel White, they took roughly 20 doses of the drug. That's...not a lot. It's quite potentially addictive even with just that, but there's plenty of other drugs that could have been used instead and those are much easier to find. <br />

**Throk:** But you still have kidneys, sometime wake up in tub with ice and no kidney.<br />
**Ensign Stern:** And yeah, Commander Bachar was here a while ago, but I haven't seen her for hours<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Two kidneys is better than none, as they say<br />

**Throk:** I notice new version of Bachar smell nicer than old version of Bachar. She must stop at perfume boutique.<br />

**Throk:** Throk know not to point this near structurally important parts of ship or near parts of ship that keep atmosphere in.<br />
*Skig wishes Murry was as wise as Throk.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** In the meantime, the repairs will take a few more days to complete. I want the senior staff to have proposals on my desk by the time repairs are complete for what we can do to track down this cartel, and how we can detect that changeling suit in the future<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'll also have to check the staff ot see if we have any changelings on board<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** However, Hailey, you must be the one to talk to Bachar first. I don't think us meatheads are gonna tease an answer out of her....Well maybe Kolea could tease an answer from her, but...you stand the best chance of figuring out what relaly happened.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Need a light touch <br />

>INTERIOR - sickbay: Commander Bachar is laying in a medical bed recovering in sickbay, Dr. Zerra is hovering nearby<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Keep it brief, she needs plenty of rest to recover<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Skig and Kolea have updated their Long Term Research Projects.</font><br />
*Kolea is wearing her D-Cup bra again and gives Bachar a knowing wink.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: somehow my headset got into a stupid state where it is perma-muted</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Everytime I press the mute button on the boom it just says "Mute off", "Mute on"</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: We can do a quick chat with Bachar if you guys want, I just can't talk on Discord because of my stupid company's product</font><br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Sorry to disappoint you all, but I'm going to live through this one<br />
**Throk:** Throk not disappointed at all. Throk think angry and vicious XO is requirement of properly functioning starship.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** YES!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Also reminder on the evidence you guys were able to save:<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Also reminder on the evidence you guys were able to save:</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Fear and respect to the pack master!<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Meant that to be in OOC</font><br />
**Throk:** Throk remember days in Gorn Navy when XO would eat underperforming members of crew to improve morale.<br />
**Kolea:** I also sometimes enjoy a good nibble from the captain.<br />
**Throk:** Throk wonder why censor keeps shrieking in pain and demanding alcohol every time Kolea speaks.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: In addiiton to the pod, Murry grabbed some computers from the Aldazed station, Zox took the Ferengi's datapad, and Skig has some detailed scans of shapeshifter goo residue from the labs on the planet</font><br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** So, I hear you let the Orions get away<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Not nearly as bad as the Captain thinks! We got this!</font><br />
*Throk patiently waits, as that is clearly directed at Murry.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Oh, also Zox and Murry can think about how to rewrite those challenged values for next week. However they are rewritten should reflect the original value, and then however it changed in reaction to the situation in which it was challenged</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** hrmm....c<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The plan was originally to steal their space station, because they left a rather inept little bomb, but unfortunately one of their men accidentally blasted open the coolant for the reactor<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah, you could say we lost our cool.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): shrugs</font><br />
*Zox shrugs*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I should demote you for that joke<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But you are alive.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Where are you pants?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Lost when I rescued you.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** In that case I'll forget about this indiscretion <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But you probably should have replicated new ones before coming here<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I would, but my new scales haven't been able to harden yet.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I need 24 hours of exposure to do so.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, back to matters at hand: Why you, Bachar? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** In that Lt. Malat can relieve you of duty for the next 24 hours so you can stay in your quarters<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: turns to Murry</font><br />
*Cmdr Bachar turns to Murry*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I mean...if that's the sort of ship you want. =D<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I have not had much time to consider it. They may have needed my clearance level to access the data they needed<br />
**Throk:** Throk willing to relieve Zox of Duty to avoid troubling Lt Malat's ongoing conversation with Neraran about best way to load chemical weapons into dispersal patterns of proton torpedoes for maximum coverage of planetary population centers during their weekly racketball time.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I may have been a convenient target because I was alone on my shore leave, not with the rest of the senior staff in the casion<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Or maybe it was purely random<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I suspect we will not be able to say until we locate them <br />
*Kolea is really worried about Throk's knowledge of what is going on in this ship.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Yeah Insight + comm or sec in this case most likely</font><br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm. So does the name Jasanis mean anything to you?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Just from what I read in your report. I had never heard the name before.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't have a fridge, in fact no one does anymore, but I'm energizing one just to put this on it. Thanks Throk!<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: We are at my stopping time, but for next week Zox and Murry have a couple of values to rewrite, and we will resolve research rolls at the start of next week</font><br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I do not know what is wrong with my mic all of a sudden<br />
