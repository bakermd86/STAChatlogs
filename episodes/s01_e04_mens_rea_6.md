**Jasanis:** Fuck you girl scout<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Rating has increased to TV-14</font><br />
**Jasanis:** Maybe I should toss you out an airlock and take bets on how long you last<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Haha! Good one Jasanis!<br />
*Jasanis takes out a disruptor and shoots K'Tat in the knee*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** AHHHHG! What was that for?<br />
*Hailey Murry is glad she didn't find that particularly funny*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm actually a science officer<br />
**Jasanis:** Oh, much better, fact police<br />
**Jasanis:** The only reason you're bleeding out on my deck right now is... Wait, why am I telling you anything?<br />
*Hailey Murry doesn't correct her about how she's not bleeding out on the deck*<br />
**Jasanis:** Lock her in the bathroom with the other two<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It sounds like you've got very limited supplies of people to talk to<br />
**Jasanis:** And drag him to my office, we're going to finish this conversation in private<br />
*Jasanis storms out*<br />
*Hailey Murry gives a little fingerwave to her back as she leaves*<br />

**Ensign Stern:** One minute I was drinking at the dabo tables, and the next thing I know I woke up here in that bathtub<br />
**Throk:** But you still have kidneys, sometime wake up in tub with ice and no kidney.<br />
**Ensign Stern:** And yeah, Commander Bachar was here a while ago, but I haven't seen her for hours<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Two kidneys is better than none, as they say<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did Commander Bachar approach you while you were drinking, Ensign? <br />
**Throk:** I notice new version of Bachar smell nicer than old version of Bachar. She must stop at perfume boutique.<br />
