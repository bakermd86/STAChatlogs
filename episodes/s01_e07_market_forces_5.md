>INTERIOR - Bazar: A group of angry Taganites push through the crowd and grab Zox by the shoulder, turning him around to face him.<br />

**Angry Taganite:** Hey! We were waiting for over 2 hours for docking clearance! You cut us off with your heap of junk and stole our docking port!<br />

**Throk:** You sure it not those other people? For instance, other people there have much more attractive human.<br />

**Angry Taganite:** I guess I can't kill both of you<br />
**Angry Taganite:** I'm going to go talk to the docking agent, figure out who I need to stab<br />
*Angry Taganite leaves with his crew*<br />
*Hailey Murry waits until they've left earshot*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, moi Salty, vhat brilli'ance you have!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, I think it's probably a good idea for us to leave sooner rather than later. It dawns on me that this is a busy marketplace, and we probably don't have to make an actual shop here. We're not about to stay for too long, are we? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are inclined to agree with the Counselor. Commander Zox seems to have lost sight of our objective, and possibly his mind<br />
**Throk:** Throk quite certain the best solution here is to identify location of Jasanis, then set main power plant to explode, then properly capture her escape pod this time, unlike last time when she escaped after destroying stealth station where she was encountered with this group previously.<br />
**Throk:** Also, for true retrospective, we should all get captured to keep plot consistent.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There are thousands of people on this station, I don't think exploding it is a good idea<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Our ship can't catch a Syndicate vessel or best it in combat.<br />
**Throk:** Throk paid for looks, not brains.<br />
*Zox blows a kiss*<br />
**Throk:** Throk just feel he not paid like Kolea is.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): Throk agree with Hailey have good idea.</font><br />
**Throk:** Why don't we find her accountant and capture accountant?<br />
**Throk:** Then ask accountant to give us details of transactions and lay out delivery plans, then use that to lay ambush.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are not able to locate the Ferengi accountant, however there is some interesting data here. The public maps of the station only map out the central promenade, the entire inner second and third quadrants of the habitat and docking rings are marked as prohibited<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Also, the station traffic log indicates a large number of unregistered vessels with Orion markings docking and departing from those areas in the past day<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Mostly small to medium freighters<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, I suppose plan B would be to get access to one of those ships somehow<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** How the fuck would I know that sir?<br />

**Ishemok:** I'm sorry friends, but our transport is no longer able to host carbon or silicon based life.<br />
**Ishemok:** You should find another transport, but I can still transport you<br />
**Ishemok:** err....beam. materialize. Something of that nature.<br />
**T'Kor:** But I'm in a protective suit already<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What are you doing to my ship you little troll<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey, Twins; what's our highest value area before we get off this station?<br />
**Ishemok:** Nothing! The spark-plugs are cheap Ferengi imports!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The cargo bays in the secure areas of the docking ring seem to be the main hub of activity for the past 24 hours<br />

**Throk:** Throk not fit in maintenance tube that size.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think we should prioritize getting a replacement ship first, or fixing the issue on Malat's ship. <br />
**Throk:** Throk not have enough lube.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ishemok, what exactly is the issue?<br />

**Throk:** Zox and Girlscout likely need to live in extradition free zone.<br />
**T'Kor:** If we can find a relatively unloved ship, I'm sure we could fix it up fairly quickly<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We have a ship, MY ship<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Without life support, though, so we at least need EVA suits<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'll see if we can locate some EVA suits, and if not we can find a backup shuttle, just in case. Hopefully T'Kor can fix up the life support on your ship, though<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As you suspected counselor, the work orders paint a clear picture of the operations in the docking ring. Raw material orders seem concentrated in cargo bay 3 and 4, indicating production facilities are located there. While maintenance orders for anti-grav loaders and cargo transporters in cargo bay 1 and docking bay 3 indicate they are being used to stage and ship finished products<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** For the past 24 hours, there are no work orders for cargo bays 3 or 4, everyone was reassigned to cargo bay 1 and the docking bay<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So they've stopped production and are unloading everything they can to get it off the station<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That seems likely<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Oh and this is odd, it seems a notice was just sent to all security personel of an intruder in the habitat ring<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** He is described as 2 meters tall, reptilian, in a chef hat<br />
**Throk:** Throk switches to Sailor Moon hat to avoid confusion.<br />
**Throk:** Also, Throk have couple suggestions.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you, Throk, the teamwork continues to be appreciated<br />
**Throk:** (1) Likely cause of termination of duties to ship things off station is because we tracked them here.<br />
**Throk:** (2) Next likely possibility is they want us to think that, because these Girlscout cookies are delicious.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** I am seeing another security bulletin coming through their internal messaging system<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It reads "Unauthorized computer access detected in Bazar level 2, security teams en-route"<br />
*Throk changes all the signs near them to Bazaar Level 3.*<br />
**Throk:** We safe now. Also, close eyes, then Security cannot see you if you cannot see them.<br />

*Throk looks at Thug.*<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** Looks like her, but they all look kind of the same to me<br />
**Throk:** Absolutely, she is violent psychopath who punches defenseless Gorn for no reason.<br />
**Nausicaan Thug:** Better take her to the brig so Jasanis can have a look<br />
**Throk:** You should probably bludgeon a few times to keep her from killing you all.<br />
