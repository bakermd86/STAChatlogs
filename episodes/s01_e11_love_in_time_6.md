>Thankfully, by the time Dr. Gallego lunged at Dr. Zerra, the away team had made it back to Lister, and Commander Bachar sent Zox and Murry down to get a handle on the situation. The implacable security officer has a firm grip on Dr. Gallego, who is clutching a throbbing wound on his forhead. Brood running down his face from a laceration over his eye. Zox is apparently unbothered by the wreckage of a computer terminal wrapped around his shins. Lt. Commander Skig and Hailey Murry have pulled Lt. Commander Viraseti into the hall, where she is rubbing her elbow gingerly and wiping blood out of her hair. Dr. Zerra is nearby, preparing an analgesic in his hypospray for the large bruise on his kidneys.<br />

>Commander Bachar is standing in the hall with her face buried in her hands, mumbling to herself. Suddenly, she raises her head, regains her composure and comes over to her senior officers.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Viraseti, this is the third physical altercation you have been involved in down here in the past 2 days. I would expect this from Lt. Malat or Zox, but not from you.... Either way, we have a situation to deal with here and your personal entanglements are getting in the way of that. Whatever is going on with these Tribbles, I am sure we stand a better chance of getting to the bottom of it if our chief science officer and the closest thing we have to a Tribble expert aren't at each other's throats.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I am ordering you to get counseling with Murry. I can't order Dr. Gallego to participate, but I CAN order Zox to lock him in the brig and charge him with assaulting a Starfleet officer if he refuses. Murry, you're in charge here until such time as you're satisfied that these two can at least work together on this problem without any more bloodshed.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes ma'am<br />
*Zox mentally debates the value of the ships counselor, and if that would just give him the edge next fight rather than avoid conflict.*<br />
*Skig notes that she is no longer in charge, and this makes her happy.*<br />

*Hailey Murry gives a strained laugh*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm able to empathize a little too well. Here, walk me through what happened. <br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Camilo and I have known for a long time that this marriage wasn't going to work out<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We stayed together to raise our daughter, but after she went to the academy I served him with the divorce and he just never signed it<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I should have known he would do something like that, he's always been a coward<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why do you say you both knew it wasn't going to work out in the long run? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Camilo is an ecologist, he loves nature and all kinds of life, and his research takes place planet-sid<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I was born in a starship, raised in starships. The longest time I have ever spent living on a planet was at the academy<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And that selfish bastard took this job way out here in the frontier during the war. I had to request a transfer off of the Leyte Gulf to an Earth-side posting IN WARTIME<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oof, and left you with your daughter? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** This place was too close to the front lines, too dangerous for a child to live here during the war<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And obviously she couldn't live on an active duty starship during wartime<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So I had to transfer<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That was a noble thing for you to do. She's grown up now, isn't she?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, she started at the academy last year<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The son-of-a-bitch didn't even visit<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why bother even serving him the papers, then?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I want to be rid of him. He can decide for himself whether he wants to have a relationship with his daughter, but I am done with him<br />

*Throk chews on the remains of what looks like a small dog femur.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Alright, I came up empty reviewing comms in and out. No sign of however Zerra or the Twins might be getting messages out to their accomplices<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** The only messages Zerra has sent are research notes with his research collaborators, and the twins have never sent or received a single message<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No friends, family, anything.<br />
**Throk:** Throk question if Bynars have ability to communicate via other means through neural empathy. Much like situation where 400 Vulcans fall over dead at once and Spock has an Alderaan moment.<br />
**Throk:** Throk also think that is wrong, Malat.<br />
**Throk:** Twins received message that led to strange Casino Heist situation from "friend".<br />
**Geret:** The twins make me dizzy, as understanding memory addresses is confusing to me and I can't think in hexidecimal.<br />
*Throk offers Malat what looks like some grilled dog meat from a dog approximately the size of the one the Twins might have cared for.*<br />
**Geret:** If math is their language, they have subtle ways to messaging other than direct communication.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think it easy to think in hexadecimal, just take off left boot and can count to sixteen using right boot as big-endian value for variable calculations.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No matter what they can do, the comm system logs message recipients and senders and the Twins have never had either as long as they've been aboard the Lister<br />
**Throk:** Throk keep right hand, left hand, and left foot of Nausicaan just to help with hexidecimal math.<br />
**Throk:** Gorn not have right digits, we use base 8 math.<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps we saw one in half and count rings? Works for determining age of arboreal creatures.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think we need to do that<br />
**T'kor:** How often do they leave the ship?<br />
*Throk wishes someone had caught on and made the cool phone tree pun.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No more than a typical crewmember. They take shore leave when available, and they are often on away missions<br />
**T'kor:** Which would make it plenty of opportunities to send information out, including recently? <br />
**T'kor:** Can we do a scan of their systems down below, see if any messages have been sent? Within network or without?<br />
**Throk:** Perhaps you are thinking too technical. Starfleet ships have mail room right? I don't mean men's restoom.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It wouldn't matter how they sent the messages, the comms transmitter has to encode everything that goes through it into subspace data packets<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If they sent anything via subspace it would be logged<br />
**Throk:** Sending encoded messages via physical means has been a thing since Voth inhabited Earth, in Throk's stupid opinion.<br />
**Throk:** Also, anyone have mustard?<br />
**T'kor:** It does, but it doesn't have to use *our* comms transmitter, does it? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That's a good point, there are ways to send messages that don't involve the comms system<br />
**Throk:** Right, sometimes Gra'lan get drunk and point naked buttocks out ship window and say he sending moonbeams. Throk remind hm space is cold.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Starships are pretty electromagnetically leaky, if you are creative about it there are a lot of EM waves going out all the time<br />
*Geret Here, I stole condiment packets from the replicator, have some mustard.*<br />
**Geret:** Here, I stole condiment packets from the replicator, have some mustard.<br />
**Throk:** Gorn spy in Klingon space once use entire range of dental hygiene equipment on Klingon battlecruiser to re-transmit their battle plans as dental drill noises.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think that would be a very effective way to send secret messages<br />
*Throk eats the mustard packets, without opening them.*<br />
**Throk:** Nonsense, no one want to listen to dental drill noises.<br />
**Throk:** Perfect way to send encrypted messages.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we do go through with T'Kor and Geret's plan of leaking them false information, we will need to figure out if they are passing that on <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** They don't seem to be using the comms system, so how do we monitor them?<br />
**Geret:** Well, in either the Twins or Zerra, what they are looking for is a way to start a war. Can't we just give them coordinates for a fleet, use some well made decoys, and see which false fleet gets blown up?<br />
**Geret:** We don't need to know _how_, just a who.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think should place audio and EM recording systems in their rooms. Whichever one gathers no information is likely the prime suspect.<br />
**T'kor:** We've got a number of sensors on board that track those EMF details for other purposes. I'll see if I can look into this. <br />
**T'kor: [ REASON  (9) +  ENGINEERING  (4)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 22]**<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But you can't necessarily know that they will go attack that fleet, or how long it would take<br />
**Geret:** I suppose there are more details to work out yes<br />
**Throk:** Why not just relay information for another cache of Jem'Hadar Pulse Weapons?<br />
**Throk:** Then see which cache gets dug up?<br />
**T'kor:  [Total: 4] [Effects: 1] [4dChallenge = 4]**<br />
**Geret:** Yes that! Juice it up and make sure they can't resist!<br />
**Throk:** Throk throw in recipe for chili con carne, most villains cannot resist.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But do we know that they would be interested in that?<br />
**Throk:** People who wish to start wars always want more guns.<br />
**Throk:** I doubt offering them salacious lizard pr0n would be as enticing as large phallic shaped weapon of doom.<br />
*Throk goes to Malat's replicator and has it create a large vat of Dog-Cat-and-Kitchen-Sink stew, with extra side of rodent.*<br />
**Throk:** Thinking make Throk hungry. Anyone want some?<br />
**Geret:** Have a few good baits. Also have a false message that Commander Bachar is taking a luxury-space cruise in some impossible backwater systems.<br />
**T'kor:** Thank you, but no. <br />
*Throk looks at Malat as he chews on half a cat.*<br />
*Geret decides to look a little more monstrous and eat vermin as well.*<br />
**Throk:** Do you question why they would want Chili Con Carne recipe? Chili Con Carne is irresistable.<br />
**Geret:** I think they can get all the Chili they want though.<br />
*Throk pushes buttons to make some on replicator, mis-types and ends up with "Chili Con Carney" and gets a rabbit stuffed with Wendy's Chili.*<br />
**Geret:** They are not rational.<br />
**Geret:** A few varied baits, carefully distributed.<br />
**Throk:** Rational thinking is like sanity. It is one trick pony. You only have rational option. As soon as you dip into insanity and irrationality, then there is no limit. Much like square root of negative one makes computer do strange things when you apply to type 2 phaser armory.<br />
**Throk:** We must think like Zox to overcome evil villains. Zox never let sanity or reason interfere with his plans.<br />
**Geret:** Hrm....<br />
**T'kor:  [Total: 2] [Effects: 0] [dChallenge = 2]**<br />
**Geret:** It's also unfair that the two people we think are the sneaks are hard to read.<br />
**T'kor:** Hmmm, it doesn't look like they used any non-comms EM signatures. Nothing like hidden messages around the time that Bachar was kidnapped, and that was an incident that Jasanis would have to have known about<br />
**Geret:** But Dr. Zerra could be using coded messages in his medical research, and the twins could be sending coded messages just in the way they create the ships logs and deflector calibrations.<br />
**Geret:** Smart doesn't need to be super exotic.<br />
**Throk:** Throk not smart, nor super exotic.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** True, the Dr does send a lot of research notes with his collaborators, and the Twins are the ops officer, they are responsible for the management of the navigation system<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And yeah, ships logs are sent to starfleet command on an automated schedule<br />
**Throk:** Navigation beacons have very long range and are mostly benign and ignored.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And the Twins are wizards with computer files, so who know what they could do there<br />
**Geret:** I appreciate your expertise T'kor, but perhaps it can't be found via engineering.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It would be easier if Zox or Throk were the spy, fewer ways they could be concealing messages<br />
*Geret blushes.*<br />
**Geret:** I don't think Zox conceals much of anything.<br />
**Throk:** For instance, if you adjust frequencly of Starfleet Navgation Band-A to harmonize at same frequency as Klingon Opera named "Bastard Cancerous Lumps that will kill me before combat" then Romulan Listening Post on border goes into reactor overload.<br />
**Throk:** Gorn teenagers do this as prank.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well that is... certainly colorful, but I take the point that navigational deflectors put out a lot of subspace energy<br />
**T'kor:** How do Gorn teenagers have access to Starfeet Navigation Band-A? <br />
**Throk:** Throk make point?<br />
**Throk:** Throk happy!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I need to see Dr. Zerra when this is done and get a brain scan, I am starting to respect Throk....<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I must have hit my head<br />
**Geret:** Throk hides nothing, everyting is in the replicator logs.<br />
**Throk:** Starfleet Navigation Band-A operate at same frequency as Gorn Radio stations, not so much access as ability to replicate signals. Not like Gorn give crap about Starfleet Communication Commission assigned frequency ranges.<br />

**T'kor:** Well, not everything, some of the parts here were hand-made with considerable precision<br />
*Geret looks at Throk's replication history and presumably sees a detailed list of the galaxy's pests and small delicious animals.*<br />
**Throk:** Also, if Throk was going to coordinate mass conspiracy with hundreds of officers who all gathered for stupid reason of deflecting gamma radiation instead of using it to cook delicious meal, using subspace navigational relays would be good way to multicast to interested neighbors.<br />
**Geret:** Yeah, but can we pinpoint that to either one of them, without the other one being just a tag-along?<br />
**Geret:** Zerra could have just gotten parts fromt the twins or the other way around<br />
**Throk:** Right, back to idea of planting information and see who acts on it.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Agreed, that seems more actionable<br />
**Throk:** Throk like idea of using plants to catch spies. Plants needed for proper fiber and digestion of spies.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We just need to slip them some juicy info, and monitor the vectors we suspect they are using to communicate<br />
*Throk replicates a large kelp that could be used as a Bynar sized nori-roll.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): ... Malat will never again want to have a meeting in her quarters with all the crap Throk is leaving around.</font><br />
**Geret:** Can't be obvious bait, One to each of them.<br />
**T'kor:** Two different pieces of bait would let us see which of them is acting on it<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Agreed<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What do you have in mind?<br />
**Geret:** "Commander Bachar's Location" and 'Secret Jem'Hadar Weapons"<br />
**T'kor:** They already know Commander Bachar's Location though<br />
**T'kor:** And I do not think they need that further, do they?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And they already got a bunch of secret Jem'Hadar weapons<br />
**Geret:** 'Secret Ketracel Production Method' 'High value target that would be good to get starfleet angery'<br />
**T'kor:** Their plan for the weapons is to have them be found, isn't it?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe, we don't actually really know<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It isn't like a bunch of Starfleet officers can stage a false flag attack using Jem'Hadar particle weapons and have people believe it was Jem'Hadar<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** And same thing if you fitted Jem'Hadar particle cannons to a Starfleet ship, it's not like people can't tell the difference between a Jem'Hadar ship and a Starfleet one<br />
**Geret:** wait isn't it _exactly_ like that?<br />
**Geret:** Oh snap, what about a distressed spy ship that needs help deep? that seems like a juicy follow up<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If a bunch of humans and Andorians started shooting a place up with Jem'Hadar weapons, people wouldn't be blinded to the fact they are human and andorian just because of the weapons<br />
**Geret:** hrm,...<br />
**Throk:** Option 1) Renegade Jem'Hadar Colony seeks entry into Federation // Option 2) Founders Lithophage sample with memtic encoding that could be used for morphogenic research ... Those Throk best ideas.<br />
**Geret:** Those are both great!<br />
**Throk:** Throk steal them from back of Cracker Jack box.<br />
*Throk offers Geret empty box of Cracker Jacks candy.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk incapable of higher thinking, Throk specialize in insanity as desire to become chief chef and security officer, like esteemed Zox.<br />
*Geret checks to see if the prize is still in the box or if Throk ate it.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ok, so who do we tell what? and how do we slip them information in a way that won't make them suspicious?<br />

**Geret:** One of us goes into the Doctors office and leaves it there accidentally.<br />
*Throk slams head into wall, begins snoring.*<br />
**Geret:** T'kor can go to the twins for technical help and leave something there<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ok, I guess someone is getting injured by Throk in a holodeck accident so they have an excuse to go to sickbay<br />
**Geret:** What if Throkk accidentally eats something bad, like broccoli or brussel sprouts?<br />
**Geret:** That's a trip to the doctor!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It might make them suspicious, Throk eats everything he sees and has never been sick from it<br />
**Throk:** We could just give it to Zox and within a couple hours he will end up in sick bay from injury.<br />
**Geret:** It's not a bad plan<br />
**Geret:** but surely Zox will notice it<br />
**Throk:** I don't think so, Zox not notice mulitple tracking beacons for many episodes.<br />
**Geret:** Okay, what if we hide it in the potted plant?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I can just take the hit, it won't be the first time I end up in sickbay from a training accident<br />
**Geret:** so we plant it in the plant, and it's a plant.<br />
**Geret:** Okay, sure.<br />
**Geret:** Well this works just fine then!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But you will have to figure out how to slip something to the twins and monitor them and Zerra to see who is passing it on<br />
**Throk:** Malat could avoid injury by just going to sick bay for extra alcohol after being subjected to Murry Counseling session, like 2/3 of crew.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Throk, you're with me. We've got an injury to fake.<br />
**Throk:** Are blood and screaming faked, or you need extra believable?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** T'Kor, Geret: figure out who's monitoring what and make sure that if the Twins or Zerra try to get this intel off the ship, you catch it<br />
**Throk:** Throk willing to shove large probes into whoever needs to be probed.<br />
**Kolea:** Me me me!<br />
**Throk:** Not that type of probe.<br />

>INTERIOR - Dr. Gallego's Quarters: Commander Bachar requested Skig meet her at Dr. Gallego's quarters to catch up her findings down in the caverns. <br />

>As the door opens, Zox, Dr. Gallego and Viraseti are engaged in some sort of nude wrestling excercise, covered in baby oil and grunting like Voth brood mothers. Murry's voice is coming from a nearby closet, where she has locked the door from the inside and is desparately repeating some sort of calming mantra as loudly as she can<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And that is what Kolea was able to determine about the feasibility of using the algae as a Tribble containment system.<br />
*Skig steps over a puddle of baby oil, completely oblivious to what is going on around her.*<br />
**Throk:** Is it made from real baby? What it taste like?<br />
**Kolea:** You aren't in this scene, go sit down.<br />
>Viraseti hooks an arm under Dr. Gallego's leg and suplexs him into the pile of foam cubes<br />

*Throk reaches from off-stage to hand Bachar a book labeled, "1001 Tribble Recipes by Rogal Dorn".*<br />
