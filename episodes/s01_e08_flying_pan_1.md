>Captains log, Stardate 61314.4. Due to delays in the Lister's repairs, our planetary survey of the Taratan Theta system is very far behind schedule. We are using our main sensor array to conduct the stellar survey and catalogue the innermost planets, but we have had to deploy shuttlecraft to perform orbital surveys of the system's other primary satellites.To help get back on schedule, I even approved Skig's request to utilize Old Faithless. She insists it is "spaceworthy" and "not a deathtrap." Regardless, I ordered her to lead the survey team using it, just in case she was overstating its level of readiness. We expect all shuttlecraft to complete their surveys and return no later than 2100 hours tomorrow. Assuming we are able to keep to that schedule, we should be back on track for our rendezvous with the USS Kinshasa.<br />

>INTERIOR - Ol' Faithless: Skig and her team are in orbit of a large T-Type gas giant in the outer planetary system. The crew are attempting to complete the survey of the planet and its seven moons. Ensign T'Kor is conducting the meteorilogical survey of the gas giant, while Dr. Zerra is conducting the biological survey of the orbital moons, and Lt. Commander Viraseti conducts the geological survey.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, have you locked down the crossfeed bifbulating deatomizer to the Herman flux regulator?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You know Commander, when you say things like that, for some reason I start to worry about the space-worthiness of this shuttle<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless is entirely reliable, I just wanted to make sure we detached the still from the warp drive cooling system. Last time we forgot that the shipboard computer became shit-faced if we spent more than 30 minutes above Warp 3.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I would advise against drinking anything created in this vessel.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** On medical and sanitary grounds<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The replicator does occasionally puke chunks of rust, probably should figure that out at some point.<br />
**T'Kor:** It has been locked down with a 75% confidence, but 22% of the nonconfidence is covered by the plan B backup where we re-purpose the power to the shuttle's left positioning thrusters to reapplicate the secondary fecundian array<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The remaining 3% being Plan C where we have to throw in enough plant based matter to the anti-matter drive that we break the time-space continuum? That's better than last time. Good job with those upgrades.<br />
**T'Kor:** I've got plenty of experience piloting Old Faithless, so don't be worried!<br />
**T'Kor:** At least, I do if you count the flights within the shuttle bay<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ensign T'Kor, the third moon appears to be class-M, I'm reading a lot of bio signs there. Could you move us into a low orbit so I can conduct the bio survey?<br />
**T'Kor:** Of course, Doctor<br />

*Skig wheels out one of those filthy looking oil change trolleys, lies down on it, and slides underneath the main computer system, which has random sparks flying from it and a small arc of lightning between two screws that Skig insists "ABSOLUTELY no one touch that or the shuttle will lose power".*<br />
>The shuttle suddenly lurches forward as power cuts out. The interior lights switch to their emergency setting, artificial gravity cuts out, and the shuttle begins tumbling through space, falling in towards the moon.<br />

*T'Kor glows to compensate*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...did anyone touch that arc of lightning that I said NOT to touch?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I don't smell burning flesh.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am afraid to touch my seat<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, did you remember to put fuel in the fusion reactor before we launched. I told you to fill the tank, not put in just 0.005 Latinum worth.<br />
**T'Kor:** No need to be worried. At least not for about 7min, at which point we should start being fairly worried. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless, set an alarm for 6 minutes and 30 seconds from now to remind me to send out the updates to the last will and testaments of everyone on the shuttle.<br />
**T'Kor:** I did, I used the fuel canisters that were sitting next to Shuttle Beta<br />
**Computer Voice:** Do it yourself<br />
**T'Kor:** I've got it<br />
*T'Kor sets an old egg timer to 6min 30s*<br />
**Computer Voice:** Thanks honey<br />
**Geret:** Ooh Ooh! Can we use the transporters to sponge up dillute hydrogen and helium isotopes from the surrounding space to shore up the fuel supply temporarily!??!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... did we bring any spare, it looks like we hit a dampening field and the engine compensator churned through all the fuel in the system.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless, set snarkiness value to 95 or current, whatever is higher.<br />
**Geret:** OOh ooh! Panel 3b.1 indicates our power is being drained from coordinates 340-209; moon 13 of that planet!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good thinking Ensign Geret, I'm reading a small amount of deuterium in a lagrange point within transporter range. But the transporters have no power to beam it aboard<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If Skig can get enough power for a single transport, it might be enough deuterium to power the engines for a few moments<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What...why...is there deuterium free floating at a lagrange point?<br />
**T'Kor:** 5 minutes remaining<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Because the dice are kind today<br />
**Geret:** There's no shortage of hot air in the universe. that's why. =D<br />

**T'Kor:** Yes, though I was looking forward to it. Please do not damage the casing. <br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't worry T'Kor, the Toy in the Kid's Meal is inert and cannot be used for this purpose.<br />
>Somehow Geret's insane plan works, T'Kor's lunch contains just enough chemical energy that she is able to power the emergency transporter and beam a small amount of deuterium into the shuttle's reactor<br />

**Geret:** WHoo hoo!! Im so glad Starfleet(TM) academy prepared me for a real mission!<br />
>The viewscreen now begins to glow orange as the shuttle falls deeper and deeper into the moon's atmosphere<br />

*Skig sighs and puts the backup generator she stores in the closet inside the Faraday Cage for just this purpose...back into the closet.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Based on my calculations, that amount of deurium will only power the engines for 3.2 seconds<br />
**Geret:** Yep, then we are definetly out of gas.<br />
**T'Kor:** I have a drone prepared to release distress signals!<br />
*T'Kor is eager to use his custom-made drone*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, send a distress signal with information concerning the dampening field and our current situation and expected landing location. Then take us in on a glide path to safely land.<br />

*T'Kor skitters over to the other side of the shuttle, picking up what apperas to be a metal box on one of the counters. It has two slits in the top, maybe an inch wide and a few inches long. *<br />
**T'Kor:** I haven't gotten the thrusters working yet, but it should still emit successfully. It's even got some good anti-espionage defense to it!<br />

**T'Kor:** Make sure you use the tube on the front of the ship, they send out in opposite directions than expected<br />
**T'Kor:** I set up a launch chute along the bottom of the ship, maximum length for maximum velocity. Not a lot in the grand scheme of things, but enough to get it away from the shuttle. <br />
>As the shuttle falls through the atmosphere, engulfed in the re-entry flames, T'Kor keeps the engines powered down until the last moments. As they emerge from the clouds, Skig spots a safe landing patch in a clearing in the trees, and T'Kor just manages to slow the descent enough to put the shuttle down in (more of less) on piece. The landing is still rough, with the crew tossed from their seats. But thankfully, no one is injured.<br />

**Geret:** Wheee! I love away missions!<br />
**T'Kor:** Whew! We'll have to recollect the landing pads along the landing route, there should be 4 sets judging from the bounces we took there. <br />
>As the chaos of the crash-landing subsides, the crew look out the windows to find themselves in a field of burning chunks of debris, in a shallow crater. Outside it is dark, and the smoke from the burning electrical components is blocking the view of the night sky.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Geret, can you retrieve all the emergency survival kits to establish a base camp once we know what the status of things are.<br />
**Geret:** Yes Ma'am!<br />
*Geret gives a hearty salute.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The atmosphere seems to be a more-or-less safe mix of Oxygen, Nitrogen, carboniferous compounds...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless just needs the nacelle reattached and we should be able to use up 95% of the duct tape in closet C to get it spaceworthy again... however, we are completely out of deuterium and antimatter. Whatever was in the dampening field we crossed wiped out our reserves.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Radiation levels are slightly elevated, but nothing dangerous<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I hope the Lister does not hit the same thing.<br />
**T'Kor:** The duct tape in closet C or closet c? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Hopefully the Lister gets our distress call and has the sense to stay out of range of whatever hit us<br />
*Geret leaps of of Old Faithless and scouts the crash site perimiter. *<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, we can only hope commander. After taking a look at the local area from a science standpoint, can you review the logs and see what you can discern about the dampening field and what our options may be to mitigate it if we have to pass back through it?<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I didn't have time to complete the bio survey, but there was a wide variety of bio signatures<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** For better or worse, Zerra, we have some time to work on that.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It seems unlikely that it could have been naturally occurring, it was not present on sensors before we entered low orbit<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Natural phenomenon do not generally turn on and off when you approach<br />
**Geret:** Huh? Those weren't _real_ wolves?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** What? No the dampening field ensign<br />
**Geret:** interesting<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Of course the animals are natural phenomenon<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pats Geret on the head like you would a small child*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I assume you already have an elaborate plan to repair the shuttle and get out of here Commander?<br />
*T'Kor checks the beast to see if it's still alive*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Repair the shuttle? Yes. Find fuel and get out of here? Not yet.<br />

**T'Kor:** Is there a way of telling if this is a wild beast or a not-wild beast?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zerra, can you check these stunned creatures and see if they are sentient and we have just violated the Prime Directive, shot someone's dog, or these are just wild beasts?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Aye ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thank you doctor.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, I will need your help getting Old Faithless functional. Go grab the blow torches and the duct tape.<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** No sign of domestication, but there is an old, healed injury on its hind quarter. I'm reading some sort of worked metal embedded in its flesh. An arrowhead perhaps? I believe ancient humans used something similar at one point.<br />
**Geret:** Very strange!<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): My God, It has an Arrow in its ass! (I'm imagining the seen from the first Shrek movie.)</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, so we may have primitives around here, who undoubtedly saw the fiery descent of our God Chariot.<br />
**Geret:** Can we be polite, and project a holo-field around the ship so they don't investigate?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or they are the remnants of a super advanced race that collapsed on itself, but meh, depends on which trope they pulled out of the hat this week.<br />
**T'Kor:** No, no, this is Old Faithless. God Chariot was decomissioned<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti frowns and looks at her tricorder*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not a bad idea Ensign Geret, but I think you may be too late.<br />
**Geret:** But but...I don't want to hurt innocents!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'm reading 2 humanoid life-forms.. No wait, this can't be right, I'm reading them 4 meters away<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Did we call that "decommissioned" on the official register? I seem to remember that one being used as a slingshot into the bridge of a Jem'Hadar Battlecruiser.<br />

>T'Kor sees nothing in any direction, but then looks up into the trees and sees two humanoid shapes squatting on thick branches in a nearby stand of trees<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nice brachiation.<br />
>When T'Kor looks up at the shapes, one of them suddenly moves. <br />

>A loud *snap* is heard, and then a broken branch falls from the tree with a young man beside it, they land on the ground with a loud thud<br />

>The young-looking man is a little more than 2 meters tall, with pale purple skin. He is wearing a simple tunic of animal skin and fur, and holding a short bow<br />

**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** I am sorry Nanon, please have mercy on my apprentice. He meant no disrepect to you or your servants<br />
>A second alien, older and stouter than the first leaps down from the tree and kneels before T'Kor<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No disrespect was taken.<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** He is young, if you must claim a sacrifice for this intrusion, take my life and let the boy go<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man cowtows at T'Kor's feet*<br />
*Skig stands behind them and looks at T'Kor.*<br />
*Skig (whispers) Repeat after me....*<br />
**Geret ** *(un-translated)*: But...don't we worship silicon gods too?<br />
*T'Kor freezes up at the idea of being a superior to someone else*<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man pulls out a knife and holds it to his throat*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** (tell them) No offense was taken, blood does not have to be spilled here. You are welcome to the bounty of the creatures my servants knocked out.<br />
*Skig looks at Geret.*<br />
**T'Kor:** No offense was taken. Blood does not have to be spilled here. You are welcome to the bounty of the creatures my...servants knocked out. <br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** By the light of the eternal flame of Nanon, Shaper of the World's Fire... I will see you again, after the world is lost to flame<br />
*Geret: nods approvingly as the token 'charisma' character here.*<br />
*Middle-Aged Alien Man lowers his knife after T'Kor interrupts him*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(un-translated)*: Yes, I worship the metal gods who do not run into the bushes and almost get my superior officer killed.<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Thank you Nanon, I am humbled by your mercy<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Saset, run back to the village, tell Piney that Nanon has returned. The Keepers of the Flame have not forsaken us<br />
**Middle-Aged Alien Man:** Our prayers have been answered at long last<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig ** *(un-translated to Zerra)*: Can you scan these nice folks for biological purposes to begin and analysis, catalogue them for Starfleet, and make sure we aren't infecting them with a horrible plague?<br />
**Geret ** *(untranslated)*: You should give them food and request shiny rocks. Surely they know where a suitable power supply is on this planet.<br />
