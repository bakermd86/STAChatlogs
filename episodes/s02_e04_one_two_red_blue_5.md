<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I can handle this<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** While I'm working on this, how is the situation with the anomaly? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you have an oxygen mask? She's grown to large for her lungs to be effective<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** It's kind of rude to say that right in front of her<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It's indirectly her fault, in the plural<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Actually, I think this might be Zox's fault<br />
*Hailey Murry is working very deftly with her three arms and hands*<br />
**Zox ** *(Squeaky)*: What? Me? Look better to have breathing trouble than dead.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do we have a replicator up here?<br />
**Ensign T'Kor** Yes, the replicator in the briefing room should work<br />
**Zox ** *(Squeaky)*: why don't we pipe some of the air from the jungle deck? That works.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I will be happy to use a CPAP machine, they are very popular with certain medical conditions.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Here are the specifications we want, and then a second one just in case she keeps getting bigger somehow. Though in that case, we may have other problems. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Also, here's some for new clothes. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Skig, you're almost getting too big for your britches <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, worse things have happened today.<br />
*Ensign T'Kor runs off to the briefing room to replicate the masks and returns momentarily with a couple of oxygen masks for Skig and a new super stretchy lycra uniform*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Take it easy for now, Skig<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Captain, what's our situation? <br />

**Hailey Murry: [ PRESENCE  (10) +  CONN  (3)]
[Focus: Diplomacy ]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 30]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** We were on a survey assignment in the Satea sector when we suddenly became enveloped in some strange anomaly. It appeared without warning and swallowed the ship.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Interesting. We'd found it, but it had jumped onto our ship as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** Since then, we have been dead in space. We've lost contact with the rest of the ship.<br />
*Zox me shows STRONG emotions.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** That's expected. It appears to have split the Lister up by deck, each deck belonging to an alternate Lister. Each time we transition a floor through the Jefferies Tubes, we transition from one Lister to another. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The dimensional barriers between the floors interrupt electrical transmissions, though not string and cup setups<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** Do you have any ideas on how to restore communication?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** It's like a pan-dimensional rubix-ship of many Listers.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Actually, based on my scans, it is a pan-wavefunction rubix-ship<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ REASON  (9) +  SCIENCE  (4)]
[Focus: Tracking Devices ]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 22]**<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): AFK work 5 mins</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** So far, I think some form of mechanical contraption will work out best. A string, transferring sound through cups, was able to work. It seems like our overlap here is entirely mechanical, with light and electrical signals being blocked and with light passing by unaffected<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We can look from your first deck to your second deck, but if we try to travel to your second deck we get the hull breach deck<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** I have been performing analysis as we have been traversing the ship. I believe that what we are experiencing is a braid in the quantum wavefunction. When it collided with the Lister, it put the ship into some kind of stable superposition. Electromagnetic waves seem to be bound to their branch where they were produced<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** I hypothesize that only macroscopic objects are able to cross the boundaries between branches. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How do we undo it? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Our bodies have such a huge number of entangled degrees of freedom, we can't be locked into a stable superposition the way a simple photon can<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Ah, yes.. Well I have no idea<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Drive the lister away from the Anomaly?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I agree with Zox. If we fly out on the exact course we came in on, it might untangle whatever happened<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Will flying a single Lister out work for all of them? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/ensign_skig.png" alt="Ensign Skig" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Skig** Or it might tear the ship apart and leave every deck floating alone in space<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** If several Skigs cannot comprehend the physics here, no mortal can. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm going to make a strange suppositional theory.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ensign_skig.png" alt="Ensign Skig" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Skig** I have been reviewing the appropriate prototocols and I believe this qualifies as a non-normal localized spatial anomoly, meaning that the appropriate course of action is to conduct a level IV survey of the spatial geomoetry before attempting escape<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): A strange suppositional superpositional theory</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** That would take days<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** One of the decks is a Borg deck, and another seems to be infested with monsters, so I don't think we'd last that long<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So soon we will have Borg monsters. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** With lazer eyes. <br />
*Zox 's other small clones gasp at this*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** As our experience is that each Lister has a unique version of me, and the only two constants we have encountered in every option is the Lister and I. Is it possible that the anomaly is instead merging the disparate Skig together and the quantum waveform superpositioning is an unintended side effect?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So...group hug among all the skigs?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** That is a reasonble hypothesis, the knot in the wavefunction could be tangled around our own wavefunction<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Ergo, the problem is my split existence and not the Lister itself.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Thank you SciSkig.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, our mutual split existence.<br />
*Skig gestures among all the Skig.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Can you... make contact with one another?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Will that cause you to merge?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ensign_skig.png" alt="Ensign Skig" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Skig** That sounds innapropriate while on duty<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Captain Skig, would you mind shaking the hand of First Officer Skig while SciSkig monitors the waveforms to see if that merges or influences our mutual Lister waveforms?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** I suppose it's worth a try...<br />
*Captain Skig shakes Skig's hand*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** No signs of any abnormal quantum fluctuation. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Hmmm. Perhaps it only works at high speeds? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Most likely we are simply from different branches of the wave function<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** If you were to somehow merge those branches together, it would be equivalent to destroying my entire universe<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** I would object on several grounds<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Not least of which is that I'd lose my entire publication history<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** So we're back to trying to leave the anomaly. Leave it, collapse it, or push it away somehow. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I think you're all like... being too scientific<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** This really does seem like a scientific problem<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Nah man, I think you've got it all wrong. This is a... spiritual problem<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Quite possibly Windbloom.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Take a giant rip, and then tell us if we ride _into_ the anomaly or ride _away_ from it, my fine sage.<br />
*Zox 's doubles applaud this suggestion.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I think we need to understand Skig in order to understand how we got here.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** To be fair, I am not sure how we are even going to arrange to maneuver the ship given that each deck is a completely different waveform.<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Err...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** That is a rediculous nonsequitor, we need to find a way to plot a course out of here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Not go on a journey of self discovery<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Discovery! there we go!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** However, SciSkig, ponder this, how would we actually plot and maneuver a manifold waveform without the ability to communicate across decks.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Computer, begin playing record 'Discovery' from the early 21st century.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh no<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The Pakleds<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What if their effigy of Skig in the cargo bays triggered this?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** And drew the anomaly toward us?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** Effigy of Skig?<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ REASON  (9) +  SCIENCE  (4)]

Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 27]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** What kind of ship are you running on your branch of the wavefunction<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes, there were Pakleds who insisted on worshipping me as the Bringer of Electricity.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We adopted some Pakleds that were raiding people for their insulating material. They're in our cargo bay right now, and they formed a cult around electrical resistance<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The longer explanation requites Denebian Ale.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Well that isn't quite what I meant by "spiritual problem" but it kind of makes sense<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The effigy they built was subject to an immense electrical  surge<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** That actually kind of makes sense, the anomaly does couple strongly with electromagnetic fields<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Hence why photons can't pass the boundaries<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ensign_skig.png" alt="Ensign Skig" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Skig** Why would you let a bunch of Pakleds build a high-power electrical Skig effigy on your ship?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ensign_skig.png" alt="Ensign Skig" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Skig** That definitely violates at least seven protocols<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It's a better question of how to stop them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We've stopped over two dozen high power apparatuses, they keep building them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Sometimes, Ensign Skig, it is better to violate protocol than cause the Lister to explode.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Besides, the Pakleds are mostly pretty harmless<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** It's not like they did this on purpose<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): as long as they are not Mostly Harmless, we are okay.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So they _did_ to it, just not on purpose. No malice, but they are causing harm<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** All right, let's go find them, shut it down, connect it to a generator and launch it into space and see if the anomaly follows it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** The Pakleds are not malicious, but calling them harmless is a little strong<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** SciSkig, what do you think our chances of success would be.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** The distributed idea of Skig is the least terrible demi-god they could have willed into existence.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ensign_skig.png" alt="Ensign Skig" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Skig** Yes, so per protocol they should be arrested and charged with unauthorized use of ship electrical systems and reckless endangerment<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** We can't do that. In our universe, Starfleet prides itself on being altruistic, and the Pakleds were being taken advantage of. We had to give htem refuge and toys for enrichment.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Well, spacing the the thing may wiork but we need to make sure that we launch in the right direction. If the anomaly takes the wrong path on the way out there's no telling what shape we'd end up in<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** So it sounds like we're back down to the Cargo Bay to take some reads of it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** Well we have the sensor data from the anomaly already, so if we cross reference that with the precise energy readings of that effigy we should be able to figure out the proper way to eject it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I agree Hailey, let us be on our way after your excellent creation of a CPAP machine.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Let us be on our way, are you joining us Captain Skig?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/captain_skig.png" alt="Captain Skig" width="50" height="50">**Captain Skig** My place is on the bridge<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Controversial Idea: Let's use the breach and walk across the exterior.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** That's actually not a bad idea<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** We could get to the cargo bay without fighting the Cassowary monster, the Borg, Random Pathogens, A mutiny, radiation, and plasma leaks.<br />
