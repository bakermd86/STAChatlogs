>INTERIOR - Greenhouse: Ensign Ghex stands before the rest of the away team, nervously clasping and unclasping her hands as her antennae fold down behind her head.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, so yeah. Anyways, that asteroid is on its way here. Um, to the planet.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, around 14km in diameter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** How long until it impacts?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well the computer is still calculating some of the parameters of its trajectory, since it only has an initial fix given that we haven't been tracking it that long. Also it depends if that ship comes along and gives it another push, but I'd say around 8 hours.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** We should bring this to the attention of the authorities here. If we can get other ships up there, we should be able to push it back and out of the trajectory<br />
