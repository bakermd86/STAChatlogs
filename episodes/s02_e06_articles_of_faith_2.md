>The cardassian finds his legs dissapear from underneath him, and he tumbles over the table, hitting his head on the edge as he crumples into a harmless pile at Skig's feet.<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Malat grabs the Cardassian by his ankle and drags him (face-down) out of the interrogation room and back to his cell. His head painfully smacks into the deck every time Malat crosses over a door threshold.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** I guess we don't realize how interesting the crew members are if we cycle through them so fast. Or maybe that they live long enough to become the villians. <br />
**Crewman McAllister** Labeling people "villains" belies a small mind with a simplistic worldview<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What about labeling people as "44 years old"? <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Ooh ooh, Ya gotta tell me. Was it Young Hailey's alcholism that made you feel without a counselor? Or did Windbloom give you a bad trip? What made you turn?<br />

**Crewman McAllister** Ma'am, I am not authorized to tell you anything.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** I hereby invoke my article 4 right to representation by an attorney. <br />
*Darisha-Han produces a rolodex out of no where and looks for Mr. Thundercock.*<br />
**Crewman McAllister** Contact the nearest Starfleet JAG posting and request a defense council. Until then, this interrogation is over.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** That Cardassian idiot may not understand Federation legal rights, but I certainly do.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Very well, we'll get you the best in the biz!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** I don't understand how you are the brooding anti-hero though. You havent' taken a single, prolonged puff on those cigarettes, Where are your edgy one-liners? I need something to work with here! How are people supposed to understand the troubled set of events that occured here? where's the story!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** MacAllister, at this point, I'm mostly curious about some modifications you made to the botany lab. As far as I'm concerned, anything else is tangential. Rather curious, I was wondering where the collection of ideas came from? Most of them were rather brilliant.<br />

[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]
Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 10]**<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): BOOSH</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): It's obvious why he was doing botanical things, the guy is an obvious plant.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): LOL</font><br />
**Crewman McAllister** It was nothing special, just simple environmental overrides and sensor bypasses. Starship systems are very complex, but that complexity means that a small change in one area can have broader consequences downstream that can make it difficult to fully secure all ship's systems<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Indeed, I have found similar issues with sensors and internal ship systems. Quite honestly, as leaky as things are, I am surprised most starships don't spend their days having ransomware removed.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** If you want my advice as a fellow engineer: securing environmental systems against tampering is an overlooked but important aspect of ship operation. Environmental systems are seen by most security officers as low-priority, but it is the one thing keeping the entire crew alive out here.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** I would recommend that you start with O2 and CO2 concetration sensors in the environmental control system. The sensor outputs are high-speed covariant signals, so they are insecure by default. But you can secure them using a narrow-band signal encrypter without any loss of throughput<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** It did take me the better part of a day to figure out how you had cross connected the logical ciruits between atmospheric controls and the replication dispensers. Excellent work, not something that I would have guessed from your profile. Seriously, I would write you a commendation for finding loopholes in environmental systems like that.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** It would make it much more difficult for anyone to puill the same trick in the future.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Noted, I will look in that suggestion along with a couple other systems.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Did your modifications extend to comms or internal sensors to adjust those as well?<br />
**Crewman McAllister** Oh, the internal sensors were no problem. Creating a blindspot on internal sensors is quite easy, it is a relatively straightforward matter to cross-couple the output from a sensor area relay back into a neighboring area, overriding its own sensor output<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Fascinating, I've found a few of those, out of curiosity, have you helped Kolea with any of her tricks? I've found a few of hers which are mildly scary. For instance, the emergency caches that don't even register properly.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** No ma'am, whatever Kolea has done is on her<br />
**Crewman McAllister** No ma'am, whatever Kolea has done is on her<br />
*Crewman McAllister shakes Skig's hand and walks out*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Have a pleasant day MacAllister and thank you.<br />
*Skig puts down that if MacAllisters is good for a commendation along with being charged with attempted murder of multiple superior officers.*<br />
>Malat takes McAllister back to his cell, returning a short while later with Zerra (in his Krepeka suit)<br />

*Skig before Zerra-Krepeka walks in, Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** All you, I'll say something if I think it is needed. And don't do anything that causes a medical emergency, since the person who stitched him back together isn't here.<br />
*Dr. Zerra sits down at the table, looking down at his feet.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Do we know how much of "Zerra" was perserved by Kolea's piles of good dice rolls?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How're you feeling, Doctor? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Very... Breen<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): So, gooey?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I thought my movement assistance suit was uncomfortable, but this environment suit is so much worse<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We're working on getting you back into your body, so hopefully we can get you into something more comfortable soon<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Are your thoughts still in order, liquid body aside?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** As far as I know<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I am not sure I would really know if I had forgotten anything<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm glad<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** That was an eminently reckless thing to have done<br />
*Hailey Murry sighs*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What lead to this? What's going on? <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Oh you know, just facing the consequences for decisions I made a long time ago<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** There's got to be something we can do together to help out, to put a stop to this<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Maybe, maybe not. But it's out of my hands <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Though perhaps I'm getting ahead of myself. Is "this" something you even want to put a stop to?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I'll tell you what I know, for whatever that is worth.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** But it isn't as much as you might think. Sam operates on a "need to know" basis<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** And I was here on the Lister with you for most of the past year and a half<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Anything's helpful<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I only know that he wanted me to keep the captain under control, to make sure the Lister made it to certain points. To find some excuse to get Zox's mother on board, and to report to him on everything the crew did.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you recall which points we had to make it to? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Well the main thing he wanted me to accomplish was to get Zox's mother on board. To see if she was conspiring with any members of the crew. But he also wanted to make sure we diverted to Skana IV for our repairs after the hull breaches you caused, even though there were other nearer facilities.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): surprisingly intact memories.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** The research facility on Skana IV was already researching Ketracel White and, in retrospect, that must have been chosen to facilitate Jasanis' operation.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you know what their plans for the matrix were? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I am not a biochemist, but my understanding is that Dr. Malov's procedure for refining Ketracel White uses founder morphogenic matrix as a stabilizer<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** The Founders themselves apparantly use a similar method, it is why it is so hard to obtain Ketracel White from any other source.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): So Sam was organizing all this through Jasanis. It makes the scene where the Federation officers watch "fake Jasanis" (aka Browena) melted down by a long distance sniper disruptor come around as him cleaning up tracks along the way.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Okay, so potentially they were using it to produce larger amounts of Ketracel White? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** How many Jem Hadar ships do they have now...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I don't know, Sam never told me<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Any idea what that cohort of near-dead Cardassians was about?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** But I know for sure they got one from the Black Hole near Sulani IV<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Plus some from the junk yard, and some from the pacifists<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I have no idea on that one, if the Cardassians are involved with Sam he never mentioned it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Like I said, he isn't real big on sharing<br />
*Darisha-Han listens in and hopes Dr. Zerra gets a good Lawyer, and also wonders what Krepeka is going through on Earth.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I wouldn't expect him to be. The question is, where on the chess board does he sit. Any idea?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Well ma'am, if I understand your analogy: I don't think he is on the chess board, I think he is playing it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I should warn you, after they extracted me, I ended up at a facility where Sam had me continuing work that I assume Neraran must have started<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** It was some kind of biogenic weapon, I don't know what the discriminator is, but it was a highly lethal nerve agent. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** You understood the analogy perfectly, doctor.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** That's dreadful<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Also something that we need to doubly-secure the environmental systems for<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Was it airborne? <br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): Unusually cooperative.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** It wasn't yet at the stage of development that it would have a delivery mechanism, so I can't say. He had me running lab tests on various cell lines to document the effects of various different chemical architectures.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Did Sam ever specify what was so important about Ruhk?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** No, he just said she was the lynchpin of some kind of conspiracy <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** He just wanted to see if she conspired with anyone on the crew<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Seems completely plausible, we have found plenty of people who were conspiring to do something.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Who did you report she was communicating with?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** She wasn't, not that I could tell<br />
**Dr. Zerra (Comms)** Senior staff report to your duty stations, we are approaching the Pelarian system.<br />
**Captain Bachar (Comms)** Senior staff report to your duty stations, we are approaching the Pelarian system.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** On our way.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Wait, one last thing ma'am.<br />
*Skig pauses.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I don't know why, but the Lister is important to whatever Sam is planning. The whole reason he sent me back here was to keep an eye on what the Lister is up to<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** If he wanted to, he could pull some strings and get the crew all reassigned to different ships across the fleet<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** For some reason, he wants you all here, doing whatever it is you are doing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** So be careful<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I concur, the Lister is very important.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Malat, would you escort the doctor back to his cell?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yup, play time is over, back in your box Doctor<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Malat escorts Dr. Zerra back the brig, as the senior staff depart for the bridge*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Before heading to the brdige, Skig will suggest that MacAllister and or Cardassian #8 might try to eliminate Zerra on us.</font><br />

**Dr. Lázaro** Oh, wonderful, you made it<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): All we need now is to have someone use the phrase, "dangerous orgiastic reproduction frenzy of mosquitos" like the government spokesperson in Japan said when cautioning people from taking walks at sunset.</font><br />
**Dr. Lázaro** I am Doctor Lazaro, I an the lead anthropologist here studying the Pelarian civilization. We have a bit of an engineering conundrum and could really use the help of one of your Starfleet engineering wizards<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** What seems to be the issue?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm first officer Skig of the USS Lister, apologies for not including that first.<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Well, we are using a duckblind system here for our study. It has started acting up in recent weeks and the issue has been getting worse. We are worried we might cause cultural contamination if the system isn't repaired soon. If the duckblind fails, we would expose this pre-industrial civilization to alien contact. It would be a catastrophe<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** It would, indeed, be a violation of the Prime Directive. Rarely do starship captains do that.<br />

**Dr. Lázaro** Wonderful, I'm so glad you're here. Let me show you to the system.<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** We don't have any engineers on-site, just me and a few graduate students. So we were really in a pickle<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** I am so grateful for this opportunity Dr. Lazaro!<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** When did it begin to malfunction?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** A few weeks ago, around the time we excavated the viewing area for the temple<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** We thought maybe we had expanded too much, but we checked the documentation and the total area of holo coverage is well within the limits<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** That is when we decided to request Starfleet assistance<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The temple is definitely suspicious, but how does it compare with the rest of the village? Is it newer, older, different architecture?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** The temple is a relatively recent construction, based on our time here we believe that they started construction around 60 years ago<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The surrounding community is older than that?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Do similar temples exist?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** What religions have you observed? Are they monotheists or polytheists? Is this temple dedicated to a new deity or an older one?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Yes, most of the villages in the area are have existed much longer. As for other temples, they certainly have them but this one seems relatively unique<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Curious.does this village trade and communicate with other villages or are they outsiders?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Ah, their religion is fascinating. It is a polytheistic religion, and they believe that they can commune with their gods in the cave under the temple <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm....<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** The priestesses are said to go on vision quests in the caverns, we have been gradually moving closer to the temple itself to study their ritual practice in greater detail<br />
