>INTERIOR - Jeffries Tube: Geret leads Skig and the rest of the team through the Jeffries tube with her nose, tracking the mysterious primate odor all the way to a service junction near the hull. There, they see a large Gorilla-like alien carrying Dr. Malov, standing near the entrance of a boarding pod lodged in the hull.<br />

>Just as it comes into sight, Geret hears a faint *click* and feels her nose press against the trigger mechanism of a cloaked anti-personel mine attached to the floor.<br />
