>INTERIOR - Skig's Machine Shop: Commander Bachar stands in the doorway of the granny flat in a floor length, black, high slit dress and a very wide-brimmed black hat that casts long shadows over her face. She is holding a lit cigarette in a long ebony and gold cigarette holder.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I hate to interrupt, but I saw Zox dumping data from Jasanis' PADD into the Twins' program and put the pieces together.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But as I said when I came in, we now have a time limit on this little operation. The captain and I just finished a briefing with Admiral Nechayev and at least 100 other captains. They won't say what's going on, but they gave us orders to be on wartime footing when we arrive at the rendezvous in 3 days. That means all non-essential systems powered off, so we need to get the data out of the holodeck before then or it's gone.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Well, to start, that sounds rather unfortunate. But also, how long have you been in the corner there? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Not that long, it took me a while to figure out what to do with these gold rings<br />
*Cmdr Bachar points to her earrings*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Why can't you just re-classify this heist as a security op and collect full time on it, all while out of whatever fleet maneuver w've been drafted to?<br />
*Skig looks at the earrings she stabbed into her elbow and figures out that might be the wrong spot for them.*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Because then we'd have to explain *why* it's a security op<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** And we're not supposed to have some of this data<br />
*Skig looks more closely at Bachar to make sure she is not missing anything else that would be a "giveaway".*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** And I don't trust the chain of command on this one<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Argh<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Zis is no problem! Ve shall cook up a plan and be done wif zit!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** If you bunch were able to find the location of that black market from a bunch of data that also went to Starfleet Intelligence, and they didn't find it, then it means they buried it<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** There's no way they're that stupid<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** No offense <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** None taken, finding the intellgence was the intelligent part of that whole ordeal<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** If we need any help on it, bring in people that are already clued in<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** We got this joint all squared up. Itll be all smooth like.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You know you don't actually have to stay in character when it's just us together<br />
*Cmdr Bachar switches into a deep, sultry voice completely different from her normal one*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But what would be the fun in that Lieutenant?<br />
*Sam Mulloy looks deflated, apparently envious of the high culture of crooks that used to inhabit Earth.*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ze program algorithm will award us extra points no? Surely jou can lighten up a bit, mademoiselle<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In any case, we need to be moving, and I'm grateful we have Bachar here to help us stay on task.<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ze program algorithm will award us extra points no? Surely jou can lighten up a bit, mademoiselle<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Quite right Commander Skig, we have much to do if we are going to be successful<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We believe that there are five main challenges:<br />
*Skig waits patiently for the Bynar's to finish speaking before offering her synopsis.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Dealing with the guards, dealing with the surveillance, getting access to the restricted areas, activating the vault elevator, and getting access to the vault<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** While, I have a solution for the vault.<br />
*Skig gets out Industrial Skig-Vault-Terminator Pulse Drill.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Of course, it is not subtle.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Which level is the vault on? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Also not necessarily going to work, what if the safe has a glass relocker?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ey. He's what's we gonna do. We gonna get a buncha low-level street operators to make a'bunch a incidents for the security team to respond to. Nuffin big, nuffin serious, jest a little bit of...undesirable activity what's dey need to make business palatable for their sophisticated customas. Den we hatch a plan. In short, a DDOS attack.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Then I let Throk use the Vault-Terminator Pulse Drill as a hand weapon on any Security Guards who get in the way?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Aight. I mean'z if you don't mind a'bit a a mess dere<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, it will definitely make a mess.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Street violence sounds like my area of expertise<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I think you may have the right number of hooligans for the distraction, as well<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I mean, at 35,000 RPM with diamond flanges and liquid cooling to vent steam directly into the affected area, it will make a mess of anything.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Dey won't know how to respond to so many low-level crimes so quickly. Dese goons won't can't think on my level, it's what ye don't see, ye know?<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Twins &gt; Amand and Dino Cloutier</font><br />
>Malat -> Trixie McAdams<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Malat -&gt; Trixie McAdams</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Skig -&gt; Ida bauers</font><br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ayy, street violence. I like it. Keep it classy though. We dont want to 'ave the real fuzz show up. Just poke...lot's a poke. <br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Ishemok -&gt; Sam Mulloy</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Have you spent any time with them yet, McAdams? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** This biker gang? No, I was at the casino bar scoping it out<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** You should touch base with your roots, see if we've got some help there<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Will do<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Do we have anyone else we want to bring in? <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I think Throk would be a good fit with the biker goons, though they'd be a bad influence on him<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** No one suspects le chef. Ze deadliest man.<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. gasps*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Kolea would be perfect to slip into the background here! <br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** I shall be in ze kitchen, ready to...accidentally cause a short with an errant souffle!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well from the goons I met, I am pretty sure they're running a brothel from the casino basement<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Would the biker goons be a bad influence on Throk, or would Throk be a bad influence on the Biker Goons?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Inquiring Minds want to know!</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** We'll want to see if there's any overlap between the bikers and the security guards as well<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** I think a good' infuence. All dey know is da poetry a' bending people a bit. Throk'll teach em class.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** This cool, Throk not used to be well-dressed large black man with so much bling.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Drop some verses while you re-arrangin some faces, eh Ignatius?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm not gonna lie, a 7 foot tall Gorn in a leather jacket looks pretty good<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Makes ya reall think all dem synth-threads we got up in space ain't really what'cha call progress eh?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** All the polyester 'aint makin style like that!<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) slicks back hair and gives a toothy smile and a thumbs up.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** They may be less aesthetically pleasing, but Starfleet uniforms are engineered to keep the wearer comfortable in a range of temperature and environmental conditions far beyond what aged animal skin can provide<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) background music begins playing whenever Throk starts walking.*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** You'se just sucked the romance right' outta it Dino!<br />
*Sam Mulloy wildly gesticulates while talking. *<br />
*Kolea shows up in a bunny outfit.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: AFK a sec </font><br />
*Sam Mulloy Whistles*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Is it gettin hotta in here?<br />
*Sam Mulloy takes out a handkerchief and wipes sweat off his brow*<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** This is the third time today I've been asked to come to a holodeck in this outfit.<br />
*"Bubbles" Kolea turns around and looks at her back.*<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Are the seams straight on the hose?<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Also, I need to start checking the crew register, I think Lieutenant Frinkleman has had seven birthday parties this year.<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** I thought maybe it was something about his species, but he is human.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I am one bad-ass walking instrument of destruction, searching for love in the casinos of Las Vegas after deciding to turn over a new leaf following years of violent warfare in Southeast Asia.<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** He wins.<br />
*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee approvingly nods.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Yeah I can't beat that.<br />
*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee hangs up his chefs hat.*<br />
**Pennington:** I believe I may be able to provide a disruption to their power supply. If it's a general repair or controlled damage, we can cause an entire area to lose power and avoid the pointed suspicion that they may have if only their facility is hit<br />
**Pennington:** I'll investigate to see how plausible that is<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** During a minature crime wave too, right?<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Your classic entropy based warfare, gone casino heist. Power out, crime, gang activity, and a kitchen fire all at the same time!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I did notice that this era, and perhaps this program in particular, seems to have issues with our ability to use an EMP to cause that effect. Hitting a nearby substation would accomplish the same effect though.<br />
*"Bubbles" Kolea looks at blueprints.*<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** OOH!!! I call dibs on recon for these spots.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I'm really curious about why one of the mafia's legal secretaries went missing. I don't think she's the type to have taken a job working under the table at a casino...<br />
*"Bubbles" Kolea points to #9 and #10 on the map.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Taking out the power is very thematically appopriate, however our research indicates that they do have a backup generator<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So if a power outage is required, we would also need to deal with the generator in the basement<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Not if ze kitchen is sucking up all the juice!<br />
**Pennington:** The backup generator is surely not as capable as the main power. What systems do they have to compromise on? <br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** I shall cook ze worlds biggest souffle!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I believe the basement is where I store the slot machines I perform "maintenance" on, I can probably shut off the backup generator by "accident".<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Cooking in industrial kitches of this era is done with a flamable gas<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Skig! I have never heard you use airquotes before.<br />
*Skig blinks and looks at Kolea with a confused expression.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** But....zat gas is my ancestors! Zis is heresy!<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** It okay, I use airquotes whenever I say Kolea is wearing clothes.<br />
**"Bubbles" Kolea:** Not that time.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I don't think it applies that time.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Alright let's get moving, it sounds like we have some ideas but nothing concrete yet. What do we still need to figure out next?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Plan of Attack to distract security away from the Vault, and then who goes to the vault and how they get it open.<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): So Tracy is going to be looking into the missing persons again (or specifically, why they went missing; she doesn't want any broken kneecaps)</font><br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Common dollface, let's engineer the diversions while the professionals get to work (looks at Malat)<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I can't distract more than six male security guards at a time. A girl has to have some limits.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If you call me dollface again I'm going to rip yours off<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): Pennington will be looking to explore and set up the potential main power outage and make sure that'll work</font><br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ah, do not be le sour, it's a game! enjoy zis baroque earth culture!<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Do you want me to apply to work at the Casino, or get kidnapped and forced to work at the Casino? Either one is fine.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Kolea, most people are not enthusiastic about the idea of being forced into sex work.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** WAIT WAIT WAIT... Sex is work? What the Hell is wrong with you?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk feel uncomfortable and wish to turn on air conditioning.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Yeah I'm not going to order you to do that, but you want to and you can get access to the social club that way, I'm not going to order you not to<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) looks at Bachar.*<br />
*Sam Mulloy feels as though skig should not be in charge of business decisions.*<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** Oh, do you want some pointers?<br />
**Pennington:** I could use some pointers<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I mean, that looks really good overall, but I think we could really work on your highlights.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Murry, checking out this missing woman sounds dangerous based on what you said, Zox, Throk and I will come with you. We shouldn't risk "Tracy" being killed in the program<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** The backup is appreciated<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk happy to help with that. Throk also happy to be Malat's new boyfriend to meet with her associates.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Actually, if I can have Zox and Throk as guards, if you'd like to talk anyone who comes looking into me, that might prove to be an efficient way of performing some espionage on their counter-espionage<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wait, if you're coded as black in the program interpreter, that might not be a great idea<br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): *take rather than talk</font><br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think these bikers have some... issues, with black people<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Okay, Throk not want Malat to have to find work next to Kolea unless wanted.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk have standards for protection.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ishemok can come with me, these people sound like a bunch of sleaze bags, I'm sure he'll fit right in<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk also want to ride large two wheeled, environmentally destructive vehicle through glass windows while firing shotgun.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** If any part of plan can involve that, Throk happy.<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ey. No need ta get clippy. I represent the highest standards of business. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm sure I can come up with a program to let you do that Throk.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk content then. Throk go with murderous psychotic Counselor woman and collect heads of her victims.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We can assist T'Kor and Skig with the power situation<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ah ze ingredients are all together. Soon the ensemble will be complete.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** All right, sounds like we have a few plans. Bynars go with T'Kor and Skig and work out the primary and secondary power. Kolea goes and does things that are best left unsaid. Malat and Mulloy go and meet with her never-do-wells. Everyone else goes with Murry to increase the bodycount. Did I miss anyone?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Skig being me, since for some reason I decided to refer to myself in third person at some point there.<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I shall go become gainfully employed!<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) leaves to get a job doing tricks at a casino.*<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
>EXTERIOR - Office Building downtown: Tracy pulls up outside the building where Beppe Renzo it listed as having a law office. Bachar is in the passenger seat of her car, while Throk and Zox are sitting up on the rear like a couple of big, green dogs<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I PITY THE FOOL.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Don't kill anyone unless they try to kill us first<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) gets out of the vehicle while background music plays.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** And even then, just break their legs or something<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Got it, tear legs off, feed to them. Proper nutrition important.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** No. We are here to interrogate this guy, not murder him<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) sneaks on scene, hands Bachar the "water spray bottle" for Bachar, leaves scene.*<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) sneaks on scene, hands Bachar the "water spray bottle" for Throk, leaves scene.*<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Down boy<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) licks lips.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** if you have a bad additude, someone is gonna eventually call you B. A. Throk<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** That sour, anyway, Ignatius Constantine is always ready to assist those in need.<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) flexes and cracks knuckles.*<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** You ready I knock down door?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Let's wait for Tracy, pretty sure we will want to have her with us<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Given that she's the only one of us that is actually programmed with a real cover identity in this program<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Im just 'ea ta make sure no one lays a finga on tracy. <br />
*Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio continues to goon in a professional manner around our dashing detective.*<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Alright boys and Bachar, let's go have a chat with Beppe<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Throk, there are times you should not ask questions.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** What's your covername, Bachar? <br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Also, why does "hand weapon" require 6 "D" Batteries?<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Let's go<br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** It's hideous though<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Thankfully, Gorn mostly colourblind outside pastels and infrared.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Did human's have different optic nerves in this period? Why would anyone do this?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** In a few years, wait until rebellious crazy coloured shag carpeting becomes fashionable.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Dis is what youse call Earth Tones. Really was the style at one point.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** It seems quite bland, yes<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Also, I don't hear anything from inside<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Let's keep our heads on a swivel, I have a bad feeling about this<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Intended to dull sense and convince everyone that this place is unimportant, just like men's room on deck 15.<br />
*Hadija Zawadi tries to open the door finding it locked*<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** However, women's restroom on deck 16 has very many nice pastel colourings on the walls.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Let's see if we can pick this lock first<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I could imagine a bomb on the other side<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Though I'm not sure if they'd have planned for someone running through the door in that case<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** I can remove lock, so you can check it in brighter light.<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Youse want me to bend this door a bit? <br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Perhaps just lift entire door frame?<br />

>Zox tries to reach through the gap along the side of the door, but can't quite reach the other handle with his thick Voth arms, so he decides to just open the door and do it from inside<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk think it maybe have been better to rip door off hinges and move out to hallway?<br />
>As Zox pushes the door open, the wire catches on the top of the door and is pulled along, running through a couple of metal eye hooks on the ceiling and back down to the trigger of a 12 guage shotgun attached to a desk, pointed at the door<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** But Throk not have years of training as Security Chief.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Ripping the door off its hinges would have certainly--<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) feels a Disturbance in the Medical World, as if dozens of people yelled "Bingo" and she was not one of them.*<br />
>The buckshot blast hits Zox square in the chest from point-blank range, knocking him across the hall and into the drywall on the other wall, and giving him a hefty electrical zap from the holodeck's non-lethal injury simlator<br />

*Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio lets out a meek wootle.*<br />
>A forcefield pops up around him to immoblize him in order to simulate the severity of his injuries<br />

*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) gets out some police caution tape and stretches it across the door frame.*<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Well if they didn't know we were here before, they probably do now<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** They'll not have much of use in here if they left a shotgun near the door<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk convinced subtlety not strong suit of anyone here not named Bachar.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** We've got limited time<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Okay, Throk help.<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** You want all drawers open?<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Yeah, toss it<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** No point being subtle now<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) pops out handy-dandy "Gorn picklocks".*<br />
*Hadija Zawadi drags Zox into the room to administer "first aid"*<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) activates flurry of "dump everything out of everywhere into the middle of the floor" combat mode.*<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) hands Bachar a medical safety strip to protect transmission of bodily fluids.*<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 19]**<br />
*Hadija Zawadi presses some hand towels from the bathroom into the bloody, gaping, simulated wound on Zox's chest. The immobilization field releases so that Zox can move, but the holodeck keeps giving him mild electrical shocks to remind him that he is still supposed to be badly wounded*<br />
**Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio:** Aw thanks, but it might be curtains for me.<br />
>Throk begins ripping drawers full of files out of the desk, but finds that two of the drawers are locked, and for some reason his mighty Gorn strength is not sufficient to simply tear them open anyways<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Important stuff in here.<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Don't be a baby, the holodeck safety protocols are still online<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** The electric shocks are just unconfortable, not dangerous<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio): MUSCLE TIME.</font><br />
>Before anyone can react, Throk picks up the heavy wooden desk and yeets it out the window like it's a tennis ball<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Oh, y'know what Ignatius, that's a good idea. You can bring that down to --<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** It break open on impact, all good.<br />
>As the desk flies out the window, the crew all look out to see where it ends up. It flies over the sidewalk and falls down into the street parking where it lands on top of a large, black four door sedan that is just pulling up to the curb<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** See, nice vehicle break fall damage of cabinet.<br />
>Three men in black suits, and one man in a brown blazer stumble out of the car, dazed<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** No problems here.<br />
**Beppe Renzo:** What the fuck was that?<br />
*Ignatius Constantine (Throk) sticks head out window.*<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Hello, are you Beppe Renzo?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Nice lady up here has questions for you.<br />
**Beppe Renzo:** Who the fuck are you!<br />
**Beppe Renzo:** Do you have any idea who you're fuckin' with?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Stay there or I throw this desk at you.<br />
**Beppe Renzo:** Wait, is that MY desk?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk only fuck with members of same species, no fucking of you, sorry.<br />
**Beppe Renzo:** Kill that mother fucker!<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** If you need fucking, I have business card for person at casino.<br />
*Beppe Renzo the three goons with Beppe take out handguns and begin shooting up towards the smashed wall at Throk*<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk sad, they imply I engage in sex with female Gorns who have clutched eggs.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:  [d20 = 4]**<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Throk feeling deprived.<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. loads up the shotgun with extra shells*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** C'mon, let's take these sons of guns down<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Ignatius Constantine (Throk)): Bachar meanwhile is going, "Where did I go so wrong in my life?"</font><br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** We can bring Ida the new car later and get it patched up<br />
>[ROUND 1]<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** We leave Beppe alive, Throk, but I think the other goons you can go to town on<br />
>[TURN] Mobster 1<br />

>[TURN] Mobster 2<br />

>[TURN] Mobster 3<br />

>Two of the goons hit Throk with their small arms fire, dealing some damage but nothing he can't handle.<br />

**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** Wait, ultra-violent Ship Counselor say it okay for Throk to tear holographic projections limb from limb?<br />
**Ignatius Constantine (Throk):** This best day ever!<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. tosses her pistol towards Zox*<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. Here's some spare ammo as well*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Here's some spare ammo as well<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. tosses an extra set of ammo*<br />
**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** No no, do not shoot Throk, you will only make him mad.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Sorry, I have to drop a cliffhanger</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Franklin woke up coughing and crying, I am holding him now but I have to go deal with him</font><br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): Good timing</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Ignatius Constantine (Throk)): No problem.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">BayushiKazemi (Tracy Dixon, P.I.): Awww, I hope he feels better soon</font><br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Guido 'Knuckes' Puzio): same</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: And yeah Brad, I forgot Throk just took a talent that gives him resistance, so that is actually just 1 damage total</font><br />
>As the goons peper the side of the building and the front of Throk with bullets, the damage from throwing a large mahogony desk through the wall finally takes its toll on the structural integrity of the shoddy, 1970s office building.<br />

>As Murry reloads Beppe's shotgun and tosses her pistol to Zox, the floor gives way beneath the team's feet, sending them tumbling out the side of the fourth floor office and down into the street below<br />
