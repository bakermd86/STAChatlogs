>Counselor's Log - The diplomatic mission to Supplemental Planet Osala is proving to be deeper than anticipated. It's been nearly 48 hours since a third of our crew vanished, including Captain Balas, and they weren't even in an Away team this time. 
The primary clues to their location came from an interview with Ambassador Talis of the Central Republic, data from a planet-side facility, and the Traveler we found in stasis within that facility. The Traveler was certainly involuntarily involved with the warp fields which took our crew members, and it appears a number of geosynchronous satellites from hundreds of years ago may have been involved as well. 
While I would love the opportunity to question the Traveler and get to the bottom of this directly, it appears he is greatly distressed at the circumstances. He has been fading in and out of reality for several minutes now and is becoming less and less responsive. I've requested assistance, hopefully a change of staff can draw him back to our reality.<br />

>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Commander Murry called Skig and Zox back to sickbay, as the Traveller began ominously phasing in and out of reality. Fortunately, the ship hasn't exploded. Yet.<br />

**Dr. Zerra:** His vital signs are all over the place. Although... I don't really have any idea what "normal" is for his species<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I think it's safe to say it isn't this<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SCIENCE  (3)]

[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]

![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I wonder if this is a physics problem more than a biology problem...<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Me thinks this poor traveller is trapped in a bubbly human seltzer of scrombled warp bubbles.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Perhaps there is a way to fuse these bubbles.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Is he still trapped, despite all appearances? <br />
**Dr. Zerra:** His neurotransmitter levels are off the scale, this could be his version of a "fight or flight" response<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** I am sorry Dr. Zerra, but this perhaps may be a case left to Skig.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Perhaps the answer is in the satellite network. <br />
*Traveller opens his eyes and looks at Zox*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** It very well might be, but I think first we should see if we could get our guest something to calm him down while we work on that<br />
**Traveller:** Inside... yes...<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Insight what? <br />
**Traveller:** Me!<br />
*Traveller cries out in pain and a bright flash of light washes over sickbay*<br />
*Skig arrives in MedBay while holding several pieces of a disassembled Osalan satellite.*<br />
>When the light subsides, the traveller is gone<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** It appears that a significant number of entities are trapped in a warp bubble that was...<br />
*Skig looked annoyed.*<br />
*Skig looks annoyed.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** hrm?<br />
*Skig ...manifested by a combination of the Traveller's natural abilities and this collection of relay satellites.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** ...manifested by a combination of the Traveller's natural abilities and this collection of relay satellites.<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (Comms):** 11 to Skig. Sir, what is going on down there? Something... unusual has happened<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Define "unusual"?<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** For reference, very little "usual" has happened in the last 48 hours.<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Sensors were knocked offline momentarily, and when they came back... Well, we are not sure how to say this...<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But, the entire universe seems to be a toroid, 400,000 km in diameter<br />
*Zox looks contemplative.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** That is...not very large<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Sir, I am reading commbadge signals on the planet's surface<br />
*Zox begins to wonder what plants he ate.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Where are they at, Lieutenant? <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I would say we have been teleported into an alternate pocket dimension where the crew and who knows how many other creatures have been sent via Warp Transference by the Traveler and the Osalan technology over the past 100 years.<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Centered around the Rolvak valley<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** How many total lifesigns from the Rolvak Valley are you reading?<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Approximately 25,000<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Let me amend that, "Total lifesigns of sentient creatures we would need to figure out how to evacuate from their prison."<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Thank you for understanding my ambiguity and providing the information I requested, Lt Malat.<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Wait, so they're not rescued, we've been captured? <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Right, that is my working hypothesis at this point.<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** It seems that way ma'am<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Your first command has been a rousing success thus far commander.<br />
*Zox flushes a dark, crimson red.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** No prison can contain the prime directive! We will break free!<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Bynars, can you scan for the sector of space where the satellites were clustered by the deflector dish and see if that is a valid egress point for the warp bubble if we can generate the inverse warp bubble we posited earlier?<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 (Comms):** Yes commander, we will begin right away<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** I'm glad we've got you around, Skig<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, you're doing an admirable job under difficult circumstances sir. <br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** A commanding officer is only as good as the crew who supports her.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Now that we are here though, let's see about finding the missing crew. Lt Malat are you able to locate the CO or XO and raise them on comms?<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 19]**<br />
*Zox claws furiously at a panel on the wall.*<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Commander Bachar's comm badge is reading loud and clear, the captain's is a weaker signal.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Let's raise Commander Bachar and determine how the missing crew is doing. Dr. Zerra, hopefully we will not need your services too much, but I imagine we will have some people who will need medical attention.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Skig, may I suggest the use of pattern enhancers to lock onto our crew and beam them aboard as a first measure?<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Lister to Bachar, do you copy?<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Sorry Zox, they do not quite work that way.<br />
**Commander Bachar (Comms):** Malat? How did you... Nevermind that, who's in command? Tell me it isn't you...<br />
**Lt. Malat (Comms):** Your last transmission was unclear. Perhaps we need to take the comms offline to see if we can fix that...<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Commander Bachar, I have assumed command of the Lister until you and/or the Captain return to the ship. Are you with the Captain?  His comm badge is not responding properly.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Negative. The captain was captured. Is Zox up there? If so, I need him to assemble a security detail and get down here<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Captured?<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Well, this is an added complication<br />
![](../images/murry.png) **Hailey Murry:** Are the diplomats still on board? <br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Full security detail, transporter room 1.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** Captured by what would be a good question.<br />
*Zox leaves for the transporter room.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** This place is a warzone, the Osalans in here have been fighting for over a century. We have been attacked a dozen times in the past 2 days<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
>♫♫♫Dramatic Music String♫♫♫<br />

![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** I was hoping for the phrase, "Captured by a traveling group of Kolea clones"<br />
>---------CUT TO COMMERCIAL-------<br />

**Hailey Murry:  [d6 = 2]**<br />
*Kolea joins Zox in the transporter room.*<br />
*Kolea has full kit of medical gear for emergency medical treatment of injured people.*<br />
*Kolea stopped in her quarters to apply some nice perfume that would be pleasant for herbivorous dinosaurs.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Excellent Kolea, I hope you can keep some of them alive for questioning.<br />
>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: Commander Zox beams down with an away team and some pattern enhancers. He finds himself in the ruins of a city. A river is running through the ruins nearby, and in the distance he sees a handful of officers huddled around a fire in a ruined building<br />

**Kolea:** Well, and also treating any injured Starfleet personnel, but my job is to treat the injured.<br />
*Commander Bachar pops her head out from behind a barricade at the sound of the transporters*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Commander, over here!<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Commander!<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** What a relief. We have found you!<br />
*Kolea heads over and looks for injured who need treatment and/or immediate evacuation.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Christ am I glad to see you. I hope Skig has a plan for getting out of this... whatever the hell this is<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** It appears so.<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** (over comms) Dr Zerra, prepare to receive injured in Transporter Room 2 (because we will Story Declaration that is the one closest to Sick Bay)<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** First, we must secure a spot for these pattern enhancers.<br />
*Commander Bachar looks haggard and exhausted, her hair and uniform unkempt*<br />
*Commander Bachar points to three crewmen sitting around a fire*<br />
*Kolea looks at Zox.*<br />
**Kurij:** What on earth has happened to you, Commander? <br />
**Commander Bachar:** You, you, you set up the pattern enhancers and help Nurse Kolea get the wounded back to the Lister<br />
**Kolea:** Sir, I believe you brought all those extra phasers down here to arm any capable crew members to assist in the defense of the area. Don't forget to hand them out.<br />
*Zox nods*<br />
**Kolea:** That was some amazing forward thinking of you as a Security Chief, I am in awe of your tactical planning.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I hope so, we were unarmed when we got here. The Osalans' energy weapons died long ago, they fight with spears and bows and arrows<br />
*Kolea resumes regularly scheduled Nurse duties of triaging injured and determining who needs to go back to the ship first.*<br />
**Kurij:** Why are they so aggressive towards you? <br />
*Zox begins organizing a defensive position around the pattern enhancers, using whatever crew, im-promtu barricades, etc.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** We stumbled into one of their little spats when we arrived, the Northern Front thought we were aiding the Central republic, and the Republic accused us of being Northern Front spies<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 10]**<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Most of the crew were captured by one side or the other. But a security team with phasers should even the odds a great deal<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Our first obligation is to get you back to the ship and secure a reliable way off planet. <br />
**Commander Bachar:** We're not leaving without the captain<br />
**Commander Bachar:** And I suspect he won't leave without the rest of the crew<br />
**Kurij:** Which one took the Captain?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Hard to say, the first few hours were chaos<br />
*Skig contemplates working with Malat to turn the phaser arrays into a giant wide area beam that they just sweep over most of the Rolvak Valley to knock out everyone once they have the non-captured crew rescued.*<br />
*Zox begins intently smelling the air*<br />

![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Kurji, can you locate faint badge signals better from down here?<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Whichever side took the captain, both of them have our crew. Suggestions: how can we get them back with a minimum of casualties?<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Take prisoners from one side and offer them in exchange.<br />
**Kurij:** Let me see what I can get set up here, sir<br />
**Kolea:** The Stun setting does wonders for reducing casualties.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I like your thinking Zox<br />
**Kurij: [ CONTROL  (11) +  ENGINEERING  (2)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 24]**<br />
**Kurij:** We could also opt to trade some weapons to one side or the other<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** If they are tearing each other to shreds, there probably wouldn't be any left if they had phasers.<br />
**Kolea:** I'm relatively certain that would be a violation of some Directive somewhere.<br />
**Kurij:** We've got two large clusters of comm badges. There's one 2km to the north, and the other a little closer to the south. Maybe a kilometer and a half<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I don't like the idea of giving weapons to a bunch of people fighting an endless war<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Well, it certainly would reach an end faster.<br />
**Kurij:** Ah, but do directives apply in alternate universes? <br />
*Zox looks rather devilish.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Always.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Then we go for the closer one.<br />
**Crewman Burkett (Hushed):** Ma'am! Another patrol coming<br />
**Kurij:** Do you think these Osalans still identify as members of their original nations? <br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Kurji, now is the time to set Phasers to stun and shoot.<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Unless you want to find out how they treat aliens.<br />
**Kolea:** I treat aliens very well.<br />
**Kolea:** In multiple meanings of that word.<br />
*Kolea gets out some small candy bars.*<br />
**Kolea:** Maybe they want these treats?<br />
*Kolea looks at nearby crewman who turned bright red.*<br />
**Kurij:** I bet they'll respond better to this one<br />
*Kurij holds up a phaser*<br />
**Kolea:** Were you thinking of something else?<br />
![](../images/zox.png) **Zox:** Candy bars! Now there's a thinking-species' weapon. <br />
**Kolea:** Right, I cannot abide violence, so, I'm going to take cover and encourage you to stun people in spots where they don't fall to their deaths or drown.<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): In before there's a 'fuzzy handcuffs' setting on the phaser.</font><br />
>[ROUND 1]<br />

>[TURN] Commander Bachar<br />

*Kolea sets her phaser to, "Debilitating Autoeroticism"*<br />
**Kurij:** Stunning barely counts as violence, though<br />

**Osalan Soldier:** Up there, in that tree! What is that?<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** It looks like... some sort of monster, probably a Central Republic plot to win the war!<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** Kill it!<br />
*Osalan Soldier runs foward, wading through the river, and throws a spear at Zox, but it glances harmlessly off the trunk of the tree*<br />
*Kolea makes a note to ask Kolea if Kolea can get a "fuzzy handcuffs" setting on her phaser.*<br />

<font color="##005500">indarien (Skig): Wow.. that is weird, I typed "Skig" and it changed the name to Kolea on that action.</font><br />
**Kurij:** I wouldn't recommend that! It's just going to make him angry<br />
*Kurij takes a defensive position, ready to stun anyone who's about to make it to the far side of the river*<br />
*Osalan Soldier moves to flank Zox and fires his bow and arrow*<br />
![](../images/skig.png) **Skig:** By the Hammer, why does that happen so randomly to people who wear red shirts in this galaxy?<br />
*Osalan Soldier The arrow flies through the tree and graze Zox's thigh*<br />
>The arrow flies through the tree and graze Zox's thigh<br />

**Osalan Soldier:** Damn lizard men!<br />
*Skig makes a mental note to continue to wear the new-style grey and red mixed shirt which provides some protection against random death due to clothing.*<br />
<font color="##005500">Masakari (Zox): Having a tie-dyed shirt is the ultimate defense, they don't know your rank or discipline.</font><br />
*Commander Bachar adjusts her phaser as she charges towards the river. She fires a wide beam into the river at a high setting, hoping to create a cloud of steam and force the Osalans into a bottleneck*<br />
>Sadly, the commander's phaser was at much too high a setting, the river begins to boil, causing agonizing screams from the Osalan in the water<br />

**Osalan Soldier:** AGHGHGHAH!<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** It burns me privates!<br />
**Kolea:** That sounds like a problem best solved with an application of a soft, supple hand rubbing aloe on them.<br />
*Crewman McAllister fires his phaser at one of the Osalans*<br />
>The Osalan stumbles, but immediately retaliates by charging McAllister with a spear<br />
