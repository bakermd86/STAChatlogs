>INTERIOR - Captain's Ready Room: The Captain has the lights turned down and has swiveled a lamp to point into Gra'lan's face. Two security officers stand guard over Gra'lan, and the captain has a number of PADDs arranged in front of him.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Mr. Gra'lan, after your dereliction of duty I had security search your quarters and they found this... <br />
*Captain Baras drops an isolinear chip onto the table*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Forged transporter records. Care to explain what you were doing with this?<br />
>[TURN] Gra'lan<br />

**Gra'lan:** I was trying to spoof whomever had deleted a record before hand!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Why didn't you report this deleted record?<br />
**Gra'lan:** I first noticed a missing entry on the transporter logs<br />
>[TURN] T'kor<br />

>[TURN] Throk<br />

**Throk:** There is a deleted record? Tell Throk who did it and Throk beat information from that treacherous person!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Violence is not the answer! A starship crew is a family, it is built on trust and mutual cooperation. Someone deleted that transporter record, you have been snooping around for the past 2 days. If you didn't delete it, then what were you doing?<br />
>[TURN] Gra'lan<br />

**Gra'lan:** I was trying to catch the varmit without clumbsy security tripped them off! We don't have our security chef here, so someone has to step up!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I find that unlikely in light of other information. Let's go back to Stardate 61489.4. Nurse Kolea requisitioned a runabout to go to Vulcan, but on the way she dropped off several crewmembers on Bajor less than a kilometer from the site of a nuclear reactor explosion a few hours later. What were they doing there?<br />
>[TURN] Ishemok<br />

**Gra'lan:** Clearly they wanted to play Parieses Squares, not by nerfed federation rules. <br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Starfleet intelligence reports indicate that the explosion was caused by intentional sabotage of a nuclear reactor belonging to a former parises suares professional. But if the crew were there, why did they not file a report on this overload?<br />
>[TURN] Geret<br />

**Geret:** What? I was here studying starfleet procols!<br />

*Captain Baras narrows his eyes*<br />
*Geret stumbles with words and is generally nervous*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I see from the communicator location logs that you've been spending a lot of time with Lt. Malat lately. She purchased a small transport a few hours after the explosion, any idea why?<br />
>[TURN] Gra'lan<br />

**Geret:** The heck should I know? If I was there, I'd get that craft to take data on that explosion! Antique devices have some of the most adorable pexplosion signatures...<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** You don't seem to be taking this seriously. Do you know what the penalty is for mutineers during wartime?<br />
>[TURN] Throk<br />

**Throk:** In Mighty Gorn Confederation, to the cafeteria with you!<br />
**Throk:** Starfleet probably give foot massage and head pats.<br />
**Throk:** Throk happy to act as Ship Counselor and Security Chef if needed to address mutiny situation.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Gra'lan): (when memes collide...)</font><br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** This isn't the Gorn confederacy, we give people trials. But if you don't start giving me some straight answers you could spend the rest of your life in a Starfleet penal colony. Now I want to know: Where did this away team go in Lt. Malat's transport on Stardate 61490?<br />
>[TURN] T'kor<br />

**T'kor:** I'm afraid I'm not able to say, sir. <br />
*Throk gets out measuring stick.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk not sure what size penis colony would mighty Gorn need to go to.<br />
**T'kor: [ PRESENCE  (7) +  COMMAND  (2)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 1]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 28]**<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** That isn't good enough damnit! We are at war, the future of the alpha quadrant is at stake! Maybe some time in the brig will change your mind....<br />
*Captain Baras gestures for a security officer to throw T'Kor in the brig*<br />
**T'kor:** Who are we at war with, sir? <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What kind of question is that! The Dominion!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Take him away<br />
**T'kor: [ PRESENCE  (7) +  COMMAND  (2)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 23]**<br />
**T'kor:** I was under the impression that the war with the Dominion was treatied out. If I recall correctly, there was an incident recently where we even parlayed with their troops. <br />
**T'kor:** A lost scout ship in a black hole's gravitational field<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Stop trying to confuse me, what are you trying to achieve. Take him away!<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** Come with me please sir, captain's orders<br />
*Crewman McAllister drags T'Kor to the bridge*<br />
**T'kor:** Crewman McAllister! It's a pleasure to see you're alive still, it's been quite some time since we saw you down in the shuttle bays<br />
**T'kor:** Your hair's grown back, quite nice<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Now to get back to the matter at hand: I want to know where you went in Lt. Malat's transport. I know it wasn't a leisure trip!<br />
>[TURN] Throk<br />

**Throk:** Zox took us all on most excellent shopping trip for Voth delicacies.<br />
**Throk:** Throk remember some claw-to-cuffs happening, but mostly forgot due to tasty food.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What Voth delicacies? What on earth can both an herbivorous Voth and a Gorn eat and enjoy?<br />
>[TURN] Ishemok<br />

**Ishemok:** Um...um....I got it! As long as it's covered in spices, they won't know! That's how I'd scam them!<br />
**Ishemok: [ PRESENCE  (9) +  COMMAND  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 22]**<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Starfleet officers don't run scams! What scams have you been running while you've been on my crew?<br />
>[TURN] Geret<br />

**Geret:** Scam? I couldn't even think of that! Starfleet is the best home I've ever had and a sancutary of pure thoughts...mostly..<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** And what about your scam of claiming to be human? I pulled your starfleet records, and your birth records are not found. What sort of scam have you been running trying to infiltrate my crew?<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (T'kor): From the audience's point of view, this is kinda funny. But from Star Fleet's point of view, this is pretty dark because I don't think these are all chronological canonically</font><br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Who really is "Geret"?<br />
>[TURN] Kolea<br />

*Geret is visibly uncomfortable at the idea that she is not 'Starfleet(TM)'*<br />
**Kolea:** She is a shapeshifter from a relatively unknown Federation member species who spends a lot of time fantasizing longingly about being a "real" member of the crew and wondering what life is like for people outside her species.<br />
**Kolea:** Are you okay Captain? You seem to be under a lot of stress.<br />
**Kolea: [ PRESENCE  (9) +  MEDICINE  (4)]

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I'm fine! I'm stressed about the shapeshifter imposters I have infiltrating my crew.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** How many other changeling infilitrators are there among the crew?<br />
>[TURN] Geret<br />

**Geret:** At least one more confirmed.<br />
*Captain Baras spit takes his coffee*<br />
**Geret:** Also I am not a changeling. ^_^;;;<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What do you mean? Who is this confirmed changeling?<br />
>[TURN] Ishemok<br />

**Ishemok:** Commander Bachar, as the real Bachar was slain the line of duty many years ago.<br />

>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Captain Baras summons the senior staff to sickbay where he is recovering from heart surgery. Several security guards are present at the doors and around his bed<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Thank you all for coming, I know these are difficult times<br />
*Captain Baras produces a small sample container full of shiny, golden fluid*<br />
*Kolea props the Captain up on pillows and scans him for irregularities.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** This is why we had to ask those questions<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** While investigaing the transporters, a technician scraped this out of the bio filters. <br />
**Geret:** It looks like part of Captain Bachar, no?<br />
**Geret:** Im so glad I don't shed. =D<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I don't know who all was consipiring with Commander Bachar, but we have a serious problem on board<br />
**Throk:** Throk can check, Throk remembers the taste of Bachar<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** That is why I ordered our diversion to Starbase 34. Under standard changeling infiltration protocol: we are returning to the nearst location equipped to do a full changeling sweep of the ship<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** But now it seems we also have an unknown number of conspirators on board who are working with this changeling infiltrator<br />
**Kolea:** Or we can just scan it for morphogenic matrix. Starfleet is not entirely unprepared for changelings these days.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** The changeling is suddenly the least of our problems, at least 2 of the crew are traitors: conspiring knowingly with this changeling infiltrator against Starfleet<br />
**Throk:** Throk wonders if ex-Counselor's research would help<br />
**Kolea:** Captain, perhaps they do not know she is a changeling?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I also can't rule out that there could be more than one changeling aboard, as we also have some other unrelated sort of shapeshifter <br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Throk): Yo wait, is Jasanis on board?!</font><br />
**Geret:** Bachar sensei isn't a traitor! <br />
**Geret:** Now, there definitely is another one on board, but it's not Bachar. <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What are you talking about<br />
**Geret:** Um....Errrrr<br />
*Kolea looks at Geret.*<br />
**Kolea:** Yes, what are you talking about?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Are you working with the changling too?<br />
**Geret:** No.<br />
*Captain Baras narrows his eyes at Geret*<br />

>Geret suddenly shapeshifts into Commander Bachar as Captain Baras' mind is filled with memories of his executive officer<br />

**Kolea:** Umm....<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** These damned shapeshifters! We can't trust any of them!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Guards, lock her up too!<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** How many changeling infiltrators are on this ship?<br />
**Kolea:** Captain please calm down, your heart can only handle simple things.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** For the remainder of this journey to Starbase 34, I am instituting a buddy system<br />
**Throk:** Throk would like to know who else is working with the changelings<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Every member of the senior staff will have a security officer to follow them around the ship<br />
**Kolea:** Captain, at least twenty members of the security staff are going to want to be my booty partner.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Well they are going to have to conduct some sort of a draw then<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Because we are only assigning 1 security officer to each of you<br />
**Throk:** What if the security officer is the changeling?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** And I am ordering a sweep for changelings. The only crewmembers that I can be certain aren't changelings are Ishemok and the Twins, and Ishemok is apparently conspiring with a changeling so the Twins will have to conduct that<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggests that we test each of them. One bite per officer. <br />
*Krepeka spooky breathing noises intensify*<br />
**Throk:** Small nibbles<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I already ordered the Twins to come up with a way to test the entire crew, what do you two have<br />
**Throk:** Throk has extensive list of new fears from them. Throk has been preparing them. <br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 step forward and look to the medical storage room, where several small tracked medical sample collection robots roll out from storage*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We believe that using these sample collection robots, we can effectively screen the entire crew over the next 2 days. We have also taken the liberty of equipping each with a small holo-emitter<br />
>Each of the robots flickers a hologram into existance around itself of the twins. You now see see several holographic copies of the twins walk slowly towards the door<br />

**Kolea:** Or we could just have everyone cycle in a transporter and screen for morpogenic matter?<br />
**Kolea:** Theoretically we could trap a changeling in the transporter buffer that way, correct?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** The transporters are still locked down due to the sabotage<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Until we determine the cause of the away team's body switching, no one can use them<br />
**Kolea:** Did that effect all the transporter rooms or just transporter room 3?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We have no way of knowing for sure, but I am not going to risk it<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Much safer to follow standard protocol until we can rendezvous with the seventh fleet at Starbase 34<br />
**Throk:** If only Skig were here, Throk knows she could find out for sure<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Admiral Kayokra can then assume command and conduct a full investigation<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** In the meantime: Throk will assemble security teams to sweep the ship for any other evidence of changelings<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I am pretty sure he is not smart enough to be conspiring against us<br />
*Krepeka emits strange green vapors and looks over charts in med bay in the background.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk appreciates the trust!<br />
>One of the holographic medical bots starts having issues navigating the doorway, and you see a holographic representation of the twins back up and then walk into a door frame several times while making comical whirring sounds<br />

**Kolea:** Captain, I am entirely certain that Throk lacks the ability to conspire against anyone who has control of the food replicators.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Now I know these are difficult times, but we need to all stay focused and remember our training. Something bad is happening on this ship, but I will not let a Dominion infiltrator use us for nefarious purposes<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We will root out these traitors and do our duty. Dismissed<br />
*Kolea scans the captain's brain patterns.*<br />
**Kolea:** Captain, you really need to rest/<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Agreed, the rest of you get to work<br />
*Krepeka continues to ominously emit wintergreen vapors.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Brig: A security officer tosses Lt. Malat into the cell with Geret, Gra'Lan, T'Kor and a small standalone computer terminal containing Ishemok<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So what are you guys in for?<br />
**T'kor:** Telling the Captain that we're not at war with the Dominion<br />
**Gra'lan:** Absolutely nothing. In Soviet Starfleet that gets you 15 years.<br />
**Geret:** I just got nervous. I can't control it...well.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** At least I actually did something to deserve it<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It is weird for all of you to be thrown in here<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well, maybe not Ishemok<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But the rest of you<br />
**Ishemok:** Being enterprising, rather than on the enterprise.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** None of us will ever serve on a ship like The Enterprise<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** They have standards<br />
**Gra'lan:** What are you in for?<br />
*Gra'lan marks another white line on the cell.*<br />
**T'kor:** The Captain appears to be exceptionally paranoid about Dominion infiltrators. I imagine anyone who sets him off will get sent down here<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Some security officer showed up at my quarters and insisted on searching them. I told him not to touch my model ships, but he broke one, so I put his face through the glass door to my sonic shower<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Apparently now I'm "a threat to the federation"<br />
**Ishemok:** Well, I think you are in the right, what that officer did was not model behavior.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Is that a promotion?<br />
*Lt. Malat high fives Ishemok's computer monitor*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Being a threat to the Federation seems like a big step up from assault.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm sure it'll blow over, captain seems to be off his meds<br />
**T'kor:** As someone who has lost many ships, you have my sympathies<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** By the time we get to Starbase 34 there's a decent chance he won't remember who we are<br />
**Gra'lan:** What makes you say that?<br />
*Gra'lan gets out tin cup and rattles it against the bars.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** He thinks we're still at war with The Dominion<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** He was ranting about changling infiltrators and mutineers<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Good thing the XO isn't here, captain seems pretty hell-bent on finding a changeling infiltrator<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She would be in real danger of getting found out if she was still on-board<br />
**T'kor:** It's a good thing that the Captain doesn't know she's a Changeling<br />
**Geret:** Maybe she's a changeling, but not a traitor....We need a traitor changeling?<br />
**Geret:** but I don't think the traitor is a changeling?<br />
*Geret appears to be stuck in a loop at the shock of being in the brig*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think ship can handle a third shapeshifter<br />
*Geret Stares at Lt. Malat.*<br />
**Geret:** Some of you change shape better than I could ever.<br />
**Geret:** The fact that we can't find the _real_ traitor here verfies that.<br />

**Gra'lan:** You know, we could just have T'Kor vent his suit towards those faulty overhead panels where the EPS conduits run to the main controls.<br />
**Gra'lan:** If it works, power shorts to the entire brig system.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well we need to do something drastic, if we get to Starbase 34 whoever the traitor is will definitely make a break for it<br />
**Gra'lan:** If it fails, we all explode like vacuum tubes on a Tuesday in August.<br />
**Gra'lan:** I mean, what's life if not full of risk, right?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Also: even if it does work, you're pretty likely to electrocute us. But I like it, drastic times call for drastic measures<br />
**Gra'lan:** Geret, can you turn into a large lead shield for the rest of us to hide behind?<br />
**Ishemok:** Why not just have Gra'lan fake a heart attack and ambush the med crew as it comes to the rescue?<br />
**Gra'lan:** How about a Horta?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Can you turn into one of those?<br />
**Gra'lan:** for instance, I was dating a Horta in Starfleet Academy.<br />
**Gra'lan:** She totally had hot and cold days.<br />
**Geret:** I uh...Um....Errrr<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Whoa, I don't think I want to hear any more details<br />
**Geret:** Im not sure I can really....synchronize...with that on an emotional level.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Ever. About anything from your past.<br />

*Gra'lan checks notes.*<br />
>Geret is enveloped in the hot, high pressure plasma and blasted across the room. The silica matrix of her shape-shifted horta form is partially melted and fuses with the borosilicate alloys in the far wall. Geret is unable to free herself or change her shape, stuck in a wall panel in horta form, in horrible pain<br />

**Gra'lan:** Nooo!!!!<br />
**Gra'lan:** We have a medical emergency here. We should get some medical people down here to assist the rock creature that suddenly appeared.<br />
>T'Kor leaps into action though, grabbing the dislodged panel and using it to redirect the plasma flow into a weak spot on the floor. He quickly starts burning a hole through the tritanium alloy, opening a gap through which to escape<br />

>As the hole opens up though, the alarm klaxxon starts blaring and security guards from the control room outside start pouring into the room<br />

**Crewman McAllister:** Stop right there! <br />
**Crewman McAllister:** We have a prisoner escape in progress!<br />
**Gra'lan:** Yes, you should stop right there!<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** We need backup, I can't tackle a laval monster spewing plasma!<br />
**Gra'lan:** It is very dangerous in here, stay back for your safety!<br />
**Crewman McAllister:** No shit, I agree<br />
**Gra'lan:** In fact, I recommend being at least three to four decks away.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Some of these people have been trained by Hailey Murray!<br />
*Gra'lan grabs Ishemok's Tandy 1000SX and slings it on his back.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** You remind me of my first visit to Radio Shack!<br />

**T'kor:** Yes ma'am, almost there<br />

**T'kor:** Crewman McAllister! You need to go to panel K5-34668 in hallway P12-2, there's a large red valve that you should be able to twist CLOCKWISE. If you do it counterclockwise, it'll come off and blast you with plasma. Go fast, or your fellow crewmen may not make it!<br />

**Gra'lan:** You can do it! Think buttery thoughts!<br />

**Crewman McAllister:** Grab it! Her! It? I don't know if Horta have gender<br />
