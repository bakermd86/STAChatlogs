>INTERIOR - USS Excaliber lounge: An older man with gray hair and a salt-and-pepper beard sits down opposite the away team and points a 23rd century style phaser at Throk under the table.<br />

**Unknown Lt.:** Oh your Gorn friend was certainly using his time. Whether it was useful remains to be seen.<br />
**Throk:** Throk like old fashioned weapons.<br />
*Throk sits down at the table.*<br />
**Throk:** You have very dignified look with facial antennae sprouts of varied colors.<br />
**Unknown Lt.:** I have a fondness for antiques myself, but what I don't like so much is when 2.5 meter tall Gorn show up and start asking people where my quarters are and where I eat<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I assure you Throkk means no ill will. This is merely the vaunted laconic Gorn communication style.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Listen, I believe there is just some level of misunderstanding, Lt ??<br />
*Unknown Lt. holds up a PADD with his free hand*<br />
*Zox extends a hand to greet the unkown lt.*<br />
**Unknown Lt.:** I already checked the duty roster, and saw Commander Zox was listed as on leave<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Negative sir. A real security officer is never on leave.<br />
**Unknown Lt.:** So I suspected you of submitting a falsified report, but now I'm thinking your impersonating a superior officer<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: you're*</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, there's no doubt that Voth are superior officers.<br />

**Throk:** Hmm... Throk understand, at certain point in cosmic scheme of things, it is time to explain carefully.<br />
**Unknown Lt.:** A Gorn, a Voth and a Tholian walk into a bar...<br />
**Unknown Lt.:** I forget the rest of the joke, but the punchline is you start telling me the truth or I throw you in the brig<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Lieutenant, here is my com badge. You clearly know what it takes to tamper with these and get away with it, and you clearly know no one could take it against a Voth's will. Check it.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Admiral Nacho, the new restaurant.</font><br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Admiral Nechayev</font><br />
**Throk:** I can certainly state that I mean no ill-will towards the Admiral Nechayev or esteemed Lt Haggarty, nor the Excalibur or any member of the crew. I am used to being on the Lister, which is made up of a rather eclectic and unusual crew of, shall I say, misfits, myself included.<br />
**Throk:** As a result of this, I was curious about the operations of an actual Starfleet vessel that would be comparable to the vessels of the Gorn, rather than something which was mothballed in the time of Kirk.<br />
**Throk:** I am sure my Tholian friend quite agrees, as we are both outsiders to the Federation.<br />
**Throk:** My apologies if my curiousity about what an actual Starfleet admiral does would cause you alarm.<br />
*Lt. Haggarty squints suspiciously at Throk*<br />
**Throk:** Now, if you don't mind, Throk done monologuing, as it is difficult and makes him feel uneasy.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Well, you're clearly all still lying, but not for the reason I thought<br />
*Throk begins looking hungrily at the nearest food replicator and wondering if it can generate a live cow.*<br />
*Lt. Haggarty puts his phaser away*<br />
*Throk lies down on ground.*<br />
**T'kor:** It is quite a difference in in setting from what we're used to<br />
**Throk:** Now Throk definitely lying!<br />
**Throk:** Throk think English is hard!<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I guess it was inevitable that someone on the Lister would get suspicious and start poking around, but I can't have you over here blundering around like a pack of idiots<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You should see them on the Lister! This is good behavior!<br />
*Throk raises hand to validate location of idiot for Lt. Haggarty.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Look, this poor Gorn needs a steak or something. Let's see what the replicators can make here...<br />

**Lt. Haggarty:** Sure, feed the Gorn. But on a deeper level: you all are jeapordizing the security of the Federation by being here.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We had to deliever the message by hand and in doing so have contributed to saving human homeworld? That's a bad thing?<br />
**T'kor:** That definitely sounds serious. What makes our presence so dangerous? <br />

**Throk:** Throk think this better than mother used to kill and throw on table when Throk was little lizard.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Someone on the Lister is a traitor to the Federation. And they are part of a conspiracy of highly connected, very supiscious people<br />
*Throk eats roast carefully with cutlery instead of claws.*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** You four blindly blundering around, drawing all the attention in the world, is going to spook our quarry and spoil months of work<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Keep those Targ Tusks for toothpicks, they are not consumable!<br />
*Throk chews on the Targ Tusks thoughtfully.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay, now you are making all the sense I knew you had Lt. So that's what this gimmick is. <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** None of you are on the suspect list, and you're all probably too incompetent to have escaped detection for this long anyways<br />
**Throk:** Throk good at blindly blundering around. Nice man who is smart and well connected but strangely only a Lt. rank for his age have any suggestions where Throk can blindly blunder next?<br />
*Throk would be mildly annoyed to not be on the suspect list, if he understood what he was being suspected of.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, with all respect, I believe we are equally incompetent. I sort of knew something was goofy, but had been unable to pin it to one crew member, due process and all. So we are at about the same stage; intuition.<br />
*Throk resists urge to "hide" behind sprig of parsley to prove that he can escape detection.*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Well I can't arrest you all and throw you in the brig without alerting our prey, and I can't have you stumbling around doing whatever you're doing now<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** So I may as well use you<br />
**Throk:** Can I interest crew members of Excalibur in Pareesi Squares game? That good way to pass time and Zox very good at breaking limbs.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If we all acted like the sort of actors they have in Federation training videos, they would know we are from a different ship. This is the best cover that is.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I suppose the safest thing is for you lot to continue doing whatever insanity you normally get up to, but direct it at my suspect list instead<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Will you not point phasers at us if we do?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Commander Bachar, Commander Zox, Commanders 11 and 10, Dr. Zerra, Commander Murry, Commander Viraseti<br />
**T'kor:** I'm glad that Commander Skig is not on that list<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** One of them is a traitor to the Federation, and you may as well help flush them out, since you've stumbled dick first into this<br />
**Throk:** Technically, none of us have dicks.<br />
**T'kor:** It may help to know the circumstances of the suspicions. Why do you suspct that one of them is a traitor? <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** No, Commander Skig is there for mission purposes. The only ship I could requisition for this was the Lister and I wasn't sure anyone else could keep it running<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): That is the most praise I think Skig would ever expect from anyone in Starfleet, good thing she is not here to hear it.</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** HRM. What have I ever done to be suspect?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** A little over a year ago, there was a failed assassination attempt against President Inyo. Our prime suspect died mysteriously while in custody on Earth<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** For the last time: I know you aren't Zox, you're clearly a telepath<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I'm half Betazed, how do you think you are going to get that one over on me?<br />
**Throk:** I can guarantee this Zox tastes nothing like Voth when bitten.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay, what has the vaunted Security Chief ever done that would make it suspicious?<br />
**Throk:** Throk have answer for that, but Throk prefer to use inside voice for it.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Our suspect list was everyone on Earth at the time who either: had access to the prisoner; had security clearance to Inyo's whereabouts and security arrangements; or had technical knowledge sufficient to gain access<br />
**T'kor:** And when you narrowed it down to only a few left, you transferred them to the Lister?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Precisely<br />
**Zox: [ FITNESS  (10) +  SCIENCE  (3)]
[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]
Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 10]**<br />
**T'kor:** Who was the victim?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** The suspect was a Starfleet security officer, who had been reassigned to the Inyo security detail a week before the assassination attempt<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well this is all very concerning.<br />
**T'kor:** Hm. Do you happen to have a dossier detailing each of the suspects whereabouts and the method of assistance they would have provided?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I can't give you any written record, we don't know how high this goes<br />
*Throk scribbles down notes to find out more information about Inyo assassination attempt.*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I can tell you what landed your crewmates on my list, if you like<br />
**Throk:** Throk think that great idea.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ooh! tell me all about them!<br />
**Throk:** Much like sunbathing belly side up after overeating.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Commander Bachar is an old friend, we used to work together. Until one day she suddenly put in for a transfer out of Starfleet intelligence, and never spoke to any of her old friends of colleagues again<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Highly unusual<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Viraseti has a dubious grasp on notions of "right" and "wrong." She has been run op the chain of command several times for submitting obviously unethical research proposals. Like her request to artificially exhaust the hydrogen supply of a main sequence star in order to study its effect on planetary geology. In an inhabited star system.<br />
*T'kor mentally makes notes of all this*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Dr. Zerra has been on my radar since the latter days of the Dominion war, his research at Starfleet Medical bore an eery similarity to the bio weapon that Section 31 developed to infect the Founders.<br />
*Throk scribbles down, "Viraseti and Neraran were roommates at the academy?"*<br />
*Throk scribbles down, "Viraseti, Zerra, and Neraran in a threesome?"*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Your Bynars are an interesting conundrum: they aren't quite who they claim to be. They aren't a natural Bynar pair, their original complementary units are either dead, or missing. A careful technical analysis shows that their network communications are not within normal Bynar parameters<br />
*Throk scribbles down, "Stop shaking Bynars and rubbing them on shag carpeting to generate electric charge, might be interfering with their implants.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Now that's interesting but that's where i can help! If you have someone that can train me on Bynar telepathy, I can pose as one and find out! <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Zox's Psychological profile from his last medical clearance indicates a high degree of unresolved anger over his lack of direct combat involvement during the war, and a tendency toward agression as a result. It is a profile which makes one susceptible to manipulation, and his previous post at Starfleet Security gave him direct personal access to the suspect, both before and after the attack<br />
*Throk hands Lt Haggarty picture of Captain Picard doing a facepalm when listening to Zox talk at a gathering of Starfleet officers.*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** And Counselor Murry was the sole survivor of mutiny under extremely dubious circumstances. Along with a long record of... questionable applications of force. Destuction, death, etc.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Although, after debriefing Lt. Elin, I am less suspicious of her<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What a boggle!<br />
**Throk:** Throk quite certain Murry only saws off heads of Jem'Hadar, Denobulans, Ferengi, and Humans with pocket knife on days ending in "y" on Starfleet calendar.<br />
**Throk:** For instance, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And I totally get why the Lister is the best tree house for a bad actor. <br />
**T'kor:** And the traitorous activity they performed was in eliminating the suspect before they could be thoroughly questioned, thus hiding the original culprit who planted them on that duty?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** You must be the smart one<br />
**Throk:** He definitely is.<br />
**Throk:** Throk know T'Kor feign death with help of Skig for years. That take good effort for Tholian.<br />
**T'kor:** Have you been personally leading most of the investigation, Lieutenant? <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Yes<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Under direct orders from Admiral Nechayev<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I'm taking a big risk involving you lot, but it's either that or arrest you and risk exposing the entire operation<br />
**Throk:** Throk want to know if assassination attempt direct result of President Inyo making the slogan, "MFGA" being so hard to pronounce.<br />
**T'kor:** Excellent. Please do not take offense to this question, then: were you in a position to have eliminated the culprit? <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** If I were involved, Inyo would have been dead and there wouldn't be a suspect<br />
**T'kor:** Why was the assassination attempt a failure? <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** The suspect used a device to rewire a replicator into a point-to-point transporter, and attempted to use it to beam a small explosive into President Inyo's transport while on a tour of a new Starfleet Medical facility on Earth<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** But Inyo's security team had to pull him from the transport at the last minute due to a scheduling conflict<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** They didn't have time to update his itinerary, so the attacker went through with their plan, and destroyed the transport, killing the pilot aboard<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** It was sheer dumb luck<br />
**T'kor:** You were on his security detail, then? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** How do we know it's only ONE Lister crew member?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** No, I wasn't even on Earth<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Good point, there could be more than one person involved<br />
**T'kor:** Oh, I see, you intended to say that you could have killed the president successfully where others have failed. I thought you'd have been involved in the event which pulled the president from the transporter. <br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** But I am certain that whoever killed our suspect is on your senior staff, there is no one else who had the opportunity, capability and availability to have done it<br />
**Throk:** How was suspect killed?<br />
**Throk:** Like disintegrator or poison or ingestion?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Poison<br />
**T'kor:** Were any of the other admirals present for that? Nechayev in particular, as he's your commanding officer.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The only thing I can do is remember this conversation never happened. But if you have a Bynar that could teach me their language, I can remove one point source of amibguity here.<br />
**Throk:** Which poison and how was it administered?<br />
**Throk:** And source of origin?<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I believe President Inyo was accompanied by Admiral Orlana of Starfleet Medical<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Unknown, it was a rapidly decaying toxin, only tiny traces were able to detected, not enough to identify it<br />
**Throk:** Err. Throk sorry, English hard, origin of poison.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** Whoever synthesized it knew what they were doing<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That sounds like something a Doctor would do!<br />
*Throk goes back to doodling threesome with Viraseti, Zerra, and Neraran.*<br />
*Lt. Haggarty checks his PADD*<br />
*Throk 's version of Threesome involves them being hogtied and slow roasted over open fire while being coated with a nice honey glaze. Were you expecting something else?*<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** I have a briefing to get to, now get off my ship<br />
*Lt. Haggarty turns off his device, allowing the sounds of the lounge to return to the table, and leaves abruptly*<br />
**Throk:** Okie dokie!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have one question. If there were no traces of the poison, what about the mechanism of action? What cellular damage occured?<br />
**Throk:** Throk excited to leave ship behind.<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** The toxin caused resprirtory failure by blocking neurological signals to the lungs<br />
**Lt. Haggarty:** He suffocated in his sleep<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Subtle.<br />
*Lt. Haggarty leaves the lounge*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, time to vamoose!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah at least we can leave without being court marshalled<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: martialed*</font><br />
**T'kor:** You were quite quiet there, Lt<br />
**Throk:** Throk happy to be Court Marshall, that mean like Bailiff or Sheriff, right?<br />
**Throk:** Much better than Court Marital or Court Martial.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If there's anything I have learned about being suspected of having committed crimes, it's: don't talk to cops<br />
**T'kor:** But we were explicitly not suspected<br />
**Throk:** Throk think T'Kor oblivious when cute.<br />
**Throk:** Or Cute when Oblivious.<br />
**Throk:** Throk doing too much thinking today.<br />
*Throk looks at T'Kor.*<br />
**Throk:** Can we use venting on your suit to cook some meat for trip back on shuttlecraft?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You just had a whole Targ!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I could go for a steak honestly<br />
**Throk:** Excellent, tonight we dine in Valhalla!<br />

**K'Tat Denellan:** Well we lost tracking when the power went out, but based on the last known position... not more than an hour<br />
**Dr. Malov:** That gives us enough time to secure the ketracel white before she arrives<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We may need to get the power up, but unless we manage to hose down the inside of the ship via the cargo bay, that might be difficult<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Yah maybe it is a daffy plan.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Whatever you plan to do, do it quickly. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Why not just deliver a bunch of reactive chemicals rather than the white?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** It would accomplish the same thing without having to outwit shields?<br />
**Kolea:** I agree with the Ferengi, also, I doubt your "spray the ship with a sticky white substance" is very plausible.<br />
*Zoxar smirks.*<br />
**Kolea:** I say this as someone who occasionally gets sprayed with sticky white substances. It does not work on Orion women the way you think it would.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** I appreciate your dedication to civilized negotiation, but Jasanis is a crazed and violent criminal.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Doctor, what if Jasanis is *not* willing to discuss terms? <br />
**Kolea:** In any case, we need to be moving, restore power, contain the morphlings, and secure the ketracel white in short order.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** T'kat, where is the ketracel shipment?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Then we destroy her shipment, show her we mean business<br />
**Kolea:** Which we are not accomplishing by discussing...<br />
*Kolea stops.*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** This way<br />
*K'Tat Denellan gestures for Zox to follow him*<br />
*Zoxar Follows*<br />
*K'Tat Denellan points to a large opn space in the center of the level, containing six large containment units *<br />
*Kolea follows along behind, with her medical tricoder out to provide advance warning of an attack.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, these little amorphous monstrosities aren't able to reproduce, are they? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Okay Doc, how do we put something in here that will detonate upon transport?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Not to the best of our knowledge, we cloned them ourselves<br />
*Dr. Malov squints at Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** They transport it up, boom.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I am not an explosives expert<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** but you are a chemist!<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Also, that wouldn't work as leverage for negotiation<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** We aren't negotiated with an insane orion<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I am not your subordinate<br />
**Dr. Malov:** You can't order me around<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** You are not, you are free to do as you wish<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** However, Starfleet can find a home for the people you care about<br />
**Dr. Malov:** If you evacuate the workers, the Orions will just bring in new ones<br />
**Dr. Malov:** And they will be working under the same conditions as we find today<br />
*Hailey Murry raises her hand*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm an explosives expert<br />
**Dr. Malov:** The only solution is to force management to negotiate, and the only leverage we have to do that is the Ketracel White<br />
*Zoxar Hugs Hailey*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, Dr Malov, we may need to take you into protective custody after this<br />

**Kolea:** You do also have the knowledge of how to make it, Dr. Malov, this is an imperfect solution but we have to think about alternative plans in case Jasanis is as unreasonable as we expect.<br />
**Kolea:** Perhaps you can offer some insight into Murry's plan as a way to put her on the ground and you to have, literally, equal footing.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Yes, by filling her ship with foam, she will be forced to land and negotiate<br />
**Dr. Malov:** And I can offer her a chemical solvent to remove the foam<br />
*Kolea made a pun and did not realize it.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** in exchange for meeting the union's demands<br />

>Zox patrols the cargo bay smelling for shapeshifters, while Murry and Malov finish up their trap. Not long after they finish rigging it, the cargo doors attempt to open, but lock up due to the power outage<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Should we ring up Jasanis? <br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Shit, that must be Jasanis<br />
*K'Tat Denellan runs and hides in a box*<br />

*Jasanis checks her chronometer*<br />
**Jasanis:** I have a FUCKING SCHEDULE to keep<br />

**Dr. Malov:** Not so fast Jasanis! I have sabotaged the shipment, and I will not fix it unless you meet our demands<br />
*Dr. Malov triumphantly reveals himself from cover *<br />
**Jasanis:** You fuckin' disgusting old worm!<br />
*Hailey Murry is recording this*<br />
**Kolea ** *(whispers)*: He has not been FUCKING anyone, I hvae a FUCKING schedule to keep. Sheesh.<br />
**Jasanis:** You want to negotiate? How's this for negotiating? I will rip out your fingernairs and feed them to you until you undo whatever you did to my shipment<br />
*Jasanis gestures to her men to go grab Malov*<br />
**Jasanis:** I am THIS close to retiring, and you are not fucking it up for me <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What about us? <br />
**Dr. Malov:** If you simply meet our demands, then you can be back on your way. Do you think you can torture me FASTER than you can agree to my demands?<br />

**Jasanis:** As the foam expands, most of the crew is able to take cover before they are hit, but Zox misjudges the distance to a nearby bulkhead and dives face first into it, further complicating his life by dislocating his shoulder<br />
