>INTERIOR - Aldazed Drug Lab: As the screams of workes echo through the halls outside, Dr. Malov seals the door and vents of the room and shrinks into his seat in terror.<br />

**Dr. Malov:** This is not an ideal outcome, the last time we had a containment breach we had several deaths, and that was just from one unit breaking containment<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Shall we leave out the window?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can you state if this is a chemical or biological hazard?<br />
**Kolea:** True?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I can't leave the rest of the workers to fend for themselves, we need to remain united and not bend to pressure from management<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): This stuff is semi-sentient?</font><br />
**Dr. Malov:** Well, the refinement of ketracel white requires some very unstable chemical compounds to react at a controlled rate. The only way to stablize the reaction is with a reagent than can alter its own molecular structure in response to the chemical reaction: changeling morphogenic matrix<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it's safe to say that management isn't about to cause the current pressure<br />
**Dr. Malov:** This is no different than any other strike breaking effort. Don't you know the history of your own planet? When the west Virginia cola miner's went on strike, management send in the Baldwin-Felts detective agency to kill them. This is no different<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Jasanis thinks she can break the strike by releasing the changling matrices<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This is significantly different. For example, what happens if those things break out of the facility and get into the city?<br />
*Kolea is quite impressed with Dr Malov's understand of Earther History.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Help me out here doc. Do you want to decrease the temperature, swap the atmosphere with inert gas?<br />
*Kolea is quite impressed with Dr Malov's understanding of Earther History.*<br />

**Kolea:** We just need to expose it to something that causes it to either retreat from the area or become docile/inert.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** The last time we had a containment breach, we had to repair the containment generators and trap it back inside containment<br />
**Kolea:** If it is not a sentient creature capable of negotation, it will operate at a basic instinctual level.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can we trap it in a transporter buffer?<br />
*Kolea check "overused cliche meter" for season.*<br />
**Kolea:** Those might not work.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is it a sentient creature, Doc?<br />
>As the crew discuss their options, the lights cut out and they are plunged into darkness. A few moments later, the emergency lighting kicks in<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I can think of quite a few sentient creatures here that only operate at the instinctual level....<br />
**Dr. Malov:** It is unclear how intelligent it is, I suggested to Jasanis that we conduct some research on it<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I suspect that it has at least a basic level of cognition, but changeling physiology is not well studied<br />
*Kolea is not sure how the Ferengi managed to end up curled up in her arms during the brief period of lights out, and is surprised he could move that fast.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What do they look like, and how many are there? I can't help but note that you sealed the vents<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Well the last time, it used the ventilation to move around<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And how did they attack?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** They are ambush predators, they can take the form of objects and surfaces, although they seem to be unable to immitate humanoids<br />
**Kolea:** So the flying chopstick is lethal, got it.<br />
*Kolea makes sure to hide all prophylactics, because, well, that would be bad.*<br />

**Dr. Malov:** We don't have time to fully sweep the lab and contain all of them before Jasanis arrives though<br />
**Kolea:  [Total: 0] [Effects: 0] [dChallenge = 0]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What would you say if I told you that we could use your help to get Jasanis completely replaced?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** How so?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Not that I doubt your sincerity, but I do doubt your capabilities<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did you not hear her on the vid feed? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** She is *not* liking our interactions very much<br />
**Kolea:** High stun settings on phasers should be able to incapacitate the monsters, if we want to setup some overlapping fields of fire and spray the area with a wide beam over any inanimate objects we see, it should allow us to stun them.<br />
*Kolea looks at Dr Malov.*<br />
**Kolea:** When you "trapped them" last time, how did you do so?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Jasanis used some of her men as bait to lure the changeling into a containment field emitter<br />
**Dr. Malov:** She does not take workplace safety very seriously<br />
**Kolea:** She does not take any sort of safety seriously, her own includ.ed.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Malov, isn't there some way to free the proud workers of Ilitz Prime, while also not torturing some barely sentient goo that might not like being farmed?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I don't make the decisions here, I was kidnapped by Jasanis and forced to work here or she would kill my family<br />
**Kolea:** Right, so do we have phasers to stun it, and people are dying, so we need to act sooner rather than later.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** But conditions in this factory are terrible, and we collectively decided to rise up in solidarity<br />
*Kolea adopts dynamic side profile action pose with pouty look.*<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): I love the fact that Jasanis kidnapped Dr Malov, not realizing and not counting on the fact that he also has a PhD in the developments of unioniziation</font><br />
**Dr. Malov:** Yes, we must make our way to the top floor. That is where we store the Ketracel White, Jasanis will bring her ship down to pick up the cargo from the roof<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How many floors?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** 2 floors above us<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So....we ambush her? That's the plan?<br />
**Kolea:** Can we feed her to the changeling matrix?<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, I'm not opposed to this particular approach.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Ambush? I don't know anything about that, but if she gets the white then we lose our only bargaining chip<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I want to secure it so we can extract some concessions out of her<br />
**Kolea:** It is easy to get concessions out of her while she is being dissolved into an acidic vat.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How easy would it be to repurpose the facility to produce other types of product? <br />
**Dr. Malov:** It is a robust chemical processing plant, it could produce all manner of other chemical compounds<br />
**Kolea:** They can make some great cosmetics.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I vote Kolea bran ...that<br />
**Kolea:** I imagine they can do wonders with a nice face scrub and body cleanser.<br />

**Kolea:** Especially something that can be rubbed luxuriously over someone's entire body, slowly and carefully while they are sprayed with a soft foamy water.<br />
**Throk:** Throk, at times, feels he is not old enough to be on this show.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Skig, at times, knows she is too old to be on this show.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay team, let's take up a defensive perimiter around the 'negotiating' roof.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Malov, can you point the way?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Naturally. Say, none of you are a changelingby any chance? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We can debate the color and scent of cosmetics in due time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nope! Solids.<br />
*Zox flexes impressive Saurian musculature.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I presume a changeling here would be quite upset with the treatment it's fellow species member is experiencing.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I once read an Earth novel where dinosaurs were put in an amusment park. Those humans! Grrr!<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Yes.. well, I shall do my best to lead us to the maintenance causeway<br />

>As Dr. Malov opens the door and begins to lead the team out of his quarters, they can see the floors smeared with blood, shattered equipment, broken glass, and severed ODN lines.<br />

>The dimly lit corridors take on a misshapen, unnatural appearance in the dim glow of the emergency lights, and an ominous silence fills the air, the screams having since faded.<br />

>INTERIOR - Shuttle Bay 2: T'Kor and Malat are preparing Ol' Faithless to launch into the highly dangerous radiation shadow of the fleet. As they work, Commander Bachar arrives with Zox and Throk.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I hope you know what you're doing taking that deathtrap <br />
**T'kor:** She's a perfectly serviceable vessel. The unorthodoxy simply adds flavor to the voyage.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think it's rather a matter of perspective. T'kor, you do not fear a few ions and such eh?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe it feels like a warm shower on a cold day?<br />
**Throk:** Throk know that all manner of life and death is faced in pursuit of Starfleet's noblest goal, which is to recklessly endanger life in the pursuit of poor merchandising to live studio audience.<br />
*Zox suddenly looks concerned.*<br />
*Commander Bachar pulls out a Klingon Mk'Leth and with a practiced swing, severs Zox's hand*<br />
*Throk picks up hand and starts chewing on it.*<br />
**Throk:** It seems to be made mostly of Voth.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hay now, those don't regrow very easily!<br />
>Before Throk can enjoy the hand, it begins to undergo some sort of strange fluctuations, changing its molecular structure and shape at random<br />

**Throk:** No, this not Voth.<br />
*Throk spits out hand.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Not a founder either<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Who the hell are you?<br />
**T'kor:** Is that not usual? <br />
**Throk:** No, usually Voth taste more like bony green vegetable.<br />
**T'kor:** But surely they are made of meat?<br />
*Throk sniffs the air.*<br />
**T'kor:** Or... are Voth part plant?<br />
**Zox: [ FITNESS  (10) +  SECURITY  (2)]

Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 20]**<br />
*Throk looks at "Zox".*<br />
*Zox Lets' out the wootle of re-uninting*<br />
**Throk:** You taste like Ensign Geret.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But clearly I am Zox, Crusher of Enemies of the Federation!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Except that Skig has a live surveillance feed from Zox and he left the Lister more than a day ago<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Computer, present location of Ensign Geret?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You trust Skig that much?<br />
**Computer Voice:** Ensign Geret is in Shuttle Bay 2<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Bawwww. Computers are the worst!~<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Impersonating a superior officer is a court marshallable offence<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But that's table stakes for service aboard the lister!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Who put you up to this? Nacheyev? Ross?<br />
**Throk:** Throk is incapable of acting superior at all times, never has to fear this superior officer idea.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Who are you working for?<br />
**Throk:** Throk tries to be inferior officer, much safer to follow orders.<br />
*Commander Bachar tosses Throk a Gorn treat*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Good boy<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I did it entirely of my own volition to test my crewmates! with all these spurious rumors of changelings I wanted to know how good everyone was at finding the bad ones.<br />
*Throk looks at Geret.*<br />
*Commander Bachar raises an eyebrow suspiciously at Geret*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I guess it was hard. I thought I had the wootles down. Maybe there's more to being a Voth.<br />
**T'kor:** Commander, I don't think there is anything that Nacheyev nor Ross would have to gain from such a ruse<br />
**T'kor:** They could, and would, take routes other than using Ensign Geret<br />
**Throk:** Creating excess paranoia is always a good plan.<br />
*Commander Bachar sighs*<br />
**Throk:** Throk use that to keep others alert. For instance, if you eat one enlisted per week, others more motivated to not be last to mess hall clean up tasks.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Bachar to Skig, you can stand down on the stasis field. False alarm. Also: after this mission I am reassigning Ensign Geret to latrine maintenance for 2 weeks<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Understood commander.<br />
**Geret:** Bawww. Ah well.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Against my better judgement, I am going to keep you on this mission<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That would be the methane toilets with the broken sumps on deck 17?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** You already know too much, and you could actually be useful <br />
**Throk:** They have good tasting bacteria.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Affirmative Commander Skig<br />
*Skig sighs, through the comm-link.*<br />
*Throk was not sighing at Bachar.*<br />
*Skig was not sighing at Bachar.*<br />
**Geret:** What would you have done if I was the real skig and there was blood all over?<br />
**Geret:** Or the real zox?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Oh please, like that idiot doesn't sever his own limbs twice a week<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Dr. Zerra wouldn't even notice when he came in to reattach it<br />
**Geret:** Oh. Most here seem pretty protective of their limbs. <br />
**Throk:** Nonsense, you are clearly not real Skig, you made scratch on floor of shuttle bay with spiky Voth boot.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** SHE WHAT?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can I space her?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Throk, if Geret tries to sabotage this mission, you have my permission to eat her<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Or him, or it?<br />
**Throk:** Throk would hug Commander Bachar, but she not like hugs.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I have no idea how your species' biology works, but Throk will still eat you<br />
**T'kor:** Them, I believe, is the appropriate term<br />
**Throk:** This best orders Throk been given in weeks.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Is that understood, Ensign?<br />
**Geret:** Yes commander....<br />
**Geret:** I'll play nice.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Good. Now since you're not actually Lt. Commander Zox, I suppose that leaves Lt. Malat in command of this mission<br />
**Throk:** Your bone things are quite springy and go well with ketchup.<br />
*Throk nudges Geret.*<br />
**Throk:** Can I pull off limbs and chew on?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Try not to sound so dissapointed ma'am<br />
*Throk gets Sriracha from replicator for this trip.*<br />
**Geret:** Sorry Throk not now.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Well now that we have dealt with Ensign Geret's lack of good judgement, I have 2 reports for your to deliver<br />
*Commander Bachar hands a pair of PADDs to T'Kor*<br />
**T'kor:** Yes, Commander. <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** One is Skig's engineering readiness report to be delivered to main engineering on the Excalibur, the other is a requisition for more radiation meds for the Bellerephon<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Once you are on-board, do your best to dig for any evidence about why Ross and Nechayev are so interested in the Lister<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I want to know what the hell is going on here<br />
**T'kor:** Understood. Which ships areNacheyev and Ross are aboard?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Nechayev's flagship is the Excaliber, Ross' is the Bellerephon<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Do NOT get caught<br />
*Geret ponders deeply which to visit first, only to get lost in arcane and esoteric thoughts of protocols and regulations.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I would say "use your best judgement" but I don't have a lot of faith in that, so use MY best judgement. If things go south, get out before you're found out<br />
**Throk:** Throk certain he not stick out like giant solitary Gorn among hundreds of pasty white humans.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Never underestimate the value of a good distraction<br />
**Geret:** Well, I promise not to get caught, but can you fix this badge? <br />
**Throk:** Throk have very good judgment, for instance, Throk determine eating Tholian is bad for dental health.<br />
**Throk:** Throk excellent distraction creator.<br />
*Commander Bachar pulls Geret's commbadge off her uniform and holds it up to her tricorder, tapping in a few keys*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Congratulations, you're Commander Zox again for today<br />
**Geret:** Yahoooo!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** You turn that back in to me at the end of this mission or I will eat you myself<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Is everyone clear?<br />
**Geret:** Yes Commander....<br />
*Throk offers bottle of Sriracha sauce to Bachar.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Aye ma'am<br />
**Geret:** Goofy species needs computers and sensors and all sorts of things to know anything....<br />
**Throk:** Geret taste much better with this.<br />
*Commander Bachar turns and walks out of the shuttle bay*<br />
*Throk looks at self.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk more green than clear.<br />
**Geret:** Today we are BOTH green friend!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** XO is certainly in a mood today<br />
**Throk:** Nonsense, this is her time of decade.<br />
*Geret wootles the tune of joy*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So, who's ready to go commit some light espionage against our own flag officers?<br />
**Throk:** I read about it in book that Murry keeps on desk of waiting room called, "Penthouse".<br />
**Kolea:** That's mine, I knew I left it somewhere.<br />
**Geret:** Is espionage more fun when the computer doesn't rat you out?<br />
**Throk:** Throk excited about this plan, Throk very familiar with looking for imposing figure standing on rock with flag attached to back.<br />
**Throk:** Flag officer like sergeant with power sword.<br />
**Geret:** Oh oh! And no helmet on!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Where to first: Nechayev or Ross?<br />
**Throk:** Also, susceptible to having head torn off by Tyranids.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): WOW. EPIC!</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): I bow to your ability to destroy our chances for success.</font><br />
**Geret:** Nechyaev sounds like more of a fun name!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Good a reason as any. Next stop: USS Excaliber<br />
*Lt. Malat lets out a resigned sigh*<br />
**Geret:** What could go wrong!!?! Wheee another Starship!<br />
**Throk:** Do not be resigned Malat, this lead to few opportunities for resignation, far more likely to be shot by firing squad.<br />
**Geret:** And goodey, tingly radiation!<br />
**Throk:** I suggest exasperated sigh, much more appropriate with less chance of misunderstanding.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I've only been out of the brig for 8 months, I was hoping to get at least a year before getting court marshalled again<br />
**Geret:** You've always got a home on the lister!<br />
**Geret:** dino hugs Lt. Malat<br />
*Geret dino hugs Lt. Malat*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we get caught I am saying you ordered me to do it<br />
**T'kor:** What are the best locations to look for the information we need? I don't think we can get either commander's personal PDA. <br />
**Geret:** Wait, this badge says Lt. Commander.....<br />
**Geret:** Look at me. I'm the captain now!<br />
**Throk:** I think T'Kor, as engineering staff, should go check out shiny engineering area and ask questions about recent places they visited and chat with other engineers.<br />
*Lt. Malat ponders T'Kor's questions*<br />
**Throk:** I will engage in competitive poetry competition while sparring with security officers in holodeck.<br />
**Throk:** Malat will drown sorrows in ship lounge and look for drunks.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well, Starship computers are highly internetworked so any files on the ship computer itself would be accessible from any terminal<br />
**Throk:** Ensign Tastes-like-Zox will do things that are best not known by rest so we aren't responsible for its death.<br />
**Throk:** That is best idea dumb lizard has.<br />
*Throk gets into shuttle craft and secures four-point harness.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But if we are talking about secret files, surely she would keep them somewhere more secure: like her quarters or her ready room<br />
**Geret:** As commander of this mission, it is an order that everyone acts your role, so you have to act like the group w bench from the lister - otherwise you will attract attention.<br />
**Geret:** You can't act too formal and too sophisticated; no one will believe you are from the Lister.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** To be clear: I am in command of this mission<br />
**Geret:** awwww<br />
**Geret:** but but but<br />
**Throk:** Mostly likely she keeps them on secret notePADD under keyboard.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You can't just impersonate a high ranking officer and gain the privileges of their rank<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not after you're discovered, at least<br />
**T'kor:** Not after you're discovered, at least<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You may look like a big sexy dinosaur, but you are still an ensign <br />
*Throk raises hand.*<br />
**Throk:** Question.<br />
**Geret:** Well... I have a question.<br />
*Geret waits patiently for Throk's question*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm not Bachar, you don't have to raise your hand<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't keep a spray bottle on hand either<br />
**Throk:** Can Ensign Tastes-Like-Zox just impersonate admirals and request data.<br />
**Throk:** I just like raising hand to air out armpits?<br />
**Throk:** This has actual meaning?<br />
**T'kor:** You do have a phaser, though<br />
*Throk raises both hands like he is on rollercoaster.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Risky, but it might get us access to restricted areas<br />
**T'kor:** I think we should avoid that. It would be ill-advised. A lesser officer, though, potentially. That sort of discrepancy, especially with surveilance outside such quarters, can raise a lot of questions and put all ships on high alert. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Reasonable<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Alright then, next stop: USS Excaliber<br />
**Geret:** But....if you no longer trust my badge, or my face, why do you trust the brass is who they say?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I should have gone with real Zox...<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): Because that is what stuns changelings enough to give everyone a chance to escape.</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** When the matrices burst free, are either of the maintenance causeways closer to that area? <br />
**Dr. Malov:** They are both similarly distant from the morphogenic containment chamber<br />
**Kolea:** Are all the morphengenic substances stored in the same location?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Ordinarly yes, the containment system is tied directly to the facility generator<br />
**Dr. Malov:** To reduce the likelihood of them losing power<br />
**Kolea:** Realistically, Jasanis just turned off the generator but did not damage it. She would want to be able to re-enable the power to be able to resume Ketracel White production once the current worker-management dispute is resolved.<br />

**Dr. Malov:** We should get out of here before it comes back<br />
**Kolea:** I concur, let us not waste more time here.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Zox is not allowed to be by himself anymore<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I feel great! <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, if we spot anyone you know, Doctor, keep in mind that they might be a changeling matrix instead<br />
**Kolea:** But what happens when his needs some little dino time by himself?<br />
**Kolea:** Right, so stun first, cuddle second!<br />
**Kolea:** Just like my middle school days!<br />
>The rest of the walk to causeway A is uneventful, with Murry laying a careful blanket of protective wide-band disruptor fire<br />

>As Zox leads the team into the causway, they begin to climb the narrow ladder up towards the next deck. Before they have reached level 2, they hear a *whoosh* from beneath them, and a blast door seals off ahead, just beyond the hatch to level 2<br />

**Dr. Malov:** Uh oh, that's a bad sign<br />
**Kolea:** I want you to know, that if anything happens to Zox, Murry is the mother of his children and needs to be kept safe.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I am NOT! That was never something that went through, I swear Kolea<br />
>From beneath them, deep in the belly of the facility, a roiling bubbling mass of burning, reacting chemicals begins to churn up from underneath, filling the causeway as it belches and foams with heat<br />

**Dr. Malov:** With the power down, the chemical containment must have also failed. Causeway A is used as an emergency vent for chemical byproducts<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I recommend we exit the causeway<br />
