>INTERIOR - Romulan Science Vessel: The crew all take places at their stations. Viraseti and V'Lor have made their calculations, Zox has programmed the deflector, the course is set. All that is lef now is to activate the sequence, and hope for the best.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Alright, everyone take positions. Let's hope this insane plan doesn't go horribly wrong<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Zox, at your discretion<br />

*Skig blinks uncomfortably.*<br />
*Commander Bachar checks the chronometer*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Around 4 minutes<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** since we activated the nav program<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We should be dropping out of warp in the vicinity of the Lister any second<br />
*Skig suspects this might be some sort of situation where people who any sort of capacity for empathy should probably do the talking.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh! I didn't think humans were poikilotherms! Get her a blanket!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's been... been years<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti takes out a tricorder and scans Murry*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Decades<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I tried to get back, to figure out a way<br />
*Skig wonders if now is a good time to ask if Murry knows any winning lottery numbers from the future.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Did you just go full innner light?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But I couldn't raise too much attention for it without risking the timeline<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It looks like she's aged about 20 years in the last few minutes<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** See if you can reverse teleomeric damage! <br />
*Skig gets out tricoder and scans Murry for any cool cybernetics or implants.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes good idea, I'll just cure aging <br />
*Hailey Murry does not have any cool cybernetics nor implants*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I appreciate that this is a damned odd situation, but you are still a Starfleet officer and dealing with difficult situations is part of the job. There will time to process this later, but right now we still need to focus on the mission<br />
*Skig is disappointed and makes sure we are where we expected the ship to be and the location of the Lister.*<br />
*Hailey Murry wipes her eyes and takes a deep breath, getting up and giving a salute to Bachar*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ready to report for duty!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Welcome back Lt. Commander<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Everyone, that Klingon Bird of Prey we hit with the transdimensional being... is currently attacking the Lister.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Of course<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would expect nothing less.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We will need to get back on board, transporters won't be an option with their shields up. Any ideas?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That little attack frigate stands no chance against a Galaxy Class vessel! Our crew will deal with it!<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Did you also spend 20 years in another time?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Umm... the Lister is a refit Constitution?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh...Um...<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Errrr<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Even I knew that<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I seem to have left some knowledge in the previous universe?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We'll all get full brain scans from Dr. Zerra when we are out of danger, who knows what that body swapping nonsense did to us<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Additionally, the Lister transwarp shielding array is modulated to skip the 110192.457Uhz range, which would allow us to transport to the bridge using the emergency bypass command authorization code, which you should be able to transmit, assuming that the Captain has not specifically blocked your codes for that purpose.<br />
*Zox wootles the wootle of ingenuity to appreciate Skig's idea*<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [2d20 = 3]**<br />
>Alright, let's give it a try<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Alright, let's give it a try<br />
*Skig is grateful Bachar doesn't ask WHY Skig would know this information.*<br />
*Commander Bachar enters her command codes over the comms, but nothing happens*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Not a good sign, if the captain locked out my command codes there is no telling what is going on over there<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Any other ideas?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We could remodulate the scan interface on the Romulan vessel to disable the Klingon's main thruster array by triggering their fuel system to cut all power through the cross-warp impulse feed that rides the exterior paneling.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That would require Zox to figure out how to engage in a tight beam pulse at these three specific locations.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm....<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I bet Gra'lan left the back hatch open in engineering, so if we had suits, we could just teleport near it and walk in. Bless that man<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The Lister has a backdoor code, it was installed by a contingent of engineers during its initial construction and should still be hardcoded into the frame. Send B77-885-S5S-K12-1866 along with our relative coordinates to the central computer and it'll bring us into the lower engineering bays. <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If this works, you will have to explain to me someday how you know that.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh... uh... change those last four digits to 6618.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I didn't know who knew that, so I changed it.<br />
*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />

*Skig is rather impressed with Old Murry and kind of likes her.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Alright, the computer says the captain is in Sickbay, the comms log indicates a mutiny is in progress and a security bulletin says Neraran is trying to kill everyone<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Typical Monday<br />
*Zox wootles for retribution*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will head for Engineering to secure it and get you whatever you need from there.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Zox, get to the bridge and take command to deal with the Klingons<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If Neraran is on board, we should probably switch to an alternate comm badge channel.<br />
