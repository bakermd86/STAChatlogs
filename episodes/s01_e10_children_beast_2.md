*Kolea looks at Zox's cover ID for her.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah yes, I had to find <Hailey> to get the right contraband drugs to help <Kolea>'s rare endangered Tholian Lava-Horse.<br />
**Kolea:** Isn't this what I already do?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Easy.<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, this is like you took my Starfleet record, redacted my name out, and then gave it to me.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And this is definetly a place where a drug-dealer could get the right stuff to save our animal.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** 'Acting'<br />
*Zox smiles at Kolea *<br />
**Kolea:** Especially this part here about fornicating with an entire village of lust crazed cephaloods. That was like, four episodes ago.<br />
>The comms light up as the border control post hails the shuttle.<br />

**Kolea:** Someone who is good at communicating should do something about that.<br />
**Breen Border Control:** Zeppalite vessel, transmit your identity documents now<br />

**Kolea:** How do they manage to have an entire three-dimensional sensor array around their entire claimed space?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Documents submitted.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It is a mystery. Even years after the war they are still enigmatic.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commander Zox was remarkably restrained in his choices of cover identities. No travelling circus of Jem'Hadar clones<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commander Bachar would not be overly dissapointed in him <br />
*Kolea shrugs.*<br />
**Breen Border Control:** What is the purpose of your visit to Breen territory<br />
*Kolea is waiting for Zox to say, "Prisoner Transport to Cellblock AA-123".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** We are on a mission of mercy, seeking the botanical wisdom of several systems to cure the terrible hoof-fungus plaguing tholian lava horses. <br />
*Kolea blinks.*<br />
**Breen Border Control:** Your entry visa indicates you have a prisoner in your care<br />
**Breen Border Control:** Why do you need a prisoner for a botanical research mission?<br />
*Kolea considers exactly how she would fornicate with a Tholian Lava Horse and live to talk about it.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** It does. This prisoner, while a wiley and tilted individual, is second to none when it comes to exbotany. <br />
*Kolea starts research project on super heavy duty heat-resistant lube.*<br />

*Candles touches up her eyeliner.*<br />
>INTERIOR - Main Engineering: Skig and T'Kor are hard at work preparing the Lister for its dangerous mission. With so much of the crew transfered back to Earth, the engine room is unusually silent save for the hum of the warp core. The silence of the two socially challenged engineers is interrupted when Commander Bachar slips out of the turbolift accompanied by Zox.<br />

*Commander Bachar checks a PADD in her hand*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** It looks like you and T'Kor finished prepping the Lister with time to spare<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes ma'am.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: And no complications to create life-threatening danger later</font><br />
*Zox makes wootling noises of joy*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I am so glad my amicable crewmates finally get the solace to enjoy practicing their talents.<br />
*Commander Bachar looks around and checks engineering is empy before sealing the door and turbolift on a control panel*<br />
**T'kor:** Good cycle, commander Bachar<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I assume by now you've reviewed the mission briefing, and you know that comms will be impacted by the radiation<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We have to manually relay communications via shuttle to and from the flagships<br />
**T'kor:** That sounds like a fine opportunity for trouble to arise<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** What it sounds like, ensign, is an opportunity for us to figure out what is going on<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, although I question why they are asking the communications crews to relay via shuttle instead of using the hyperlink photonic relays built into the ships to transmit morse code via the interpolation of the rear nacelle tracking light and the forward array disks.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** But sure, we can stick people in shuttle craft.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Well be glad that they lack your outside-the-box thinking Commander<br />
*Skig mostly does not want Old Faithless to get damaged.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Because it gives us an excuse to be on Nechayev and Ross' flagships<br />
*T'kor: is confident that even if Old Faithless gets damaged, he can fix it*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** They led the captain's command competency review, one or both of them are up to something<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm.....<br />
*Zox lets out the wootle of being care-free and not suspect.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I can't justify putting myself on a comms team, so Commander Zox will lead the away team<br />

*Skig looks suspiciously at Zox.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hello.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm....<br />
*Skig shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I stand ready to play relay messenger.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** As I understand it, it is an ancient earth sport based on even more ancient warfare.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** My cold-dino heart appreciates this efficiency.<br />

*Commander Bachar pats Zox on the head*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** That's nice<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Just don't get caught<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** You're committing a crime that could get you all courts marshalled<br />
*Skig gets out engineering tricoder, waves it in Zox's general direction, checks to see if that matches Zox's normal medical readings.*<br />
*T'kor registers this behavior and makes mental note that this is apparently an appropriate way to talk to and act to your subordinates (if he ever gets any)*<br />
*Skig looks at Bachar.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You all?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Relax, I know better than to think I could pry you away from engineering while the ship is in danger<br />
*Zox seems oblivious and innocent*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Commander, are you clear on the mission?<br />
*Commander Bachar glares at Zox*<br />
**T'kor:** Configuration of the other Star Fleet vessels is identical to that of the Lister, yes? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Right, I shall do my best to ensure the Lister exceeds the expectations for a ship stuck in slot 275.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I understand that information security is also part of the job!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And that relaying messages from the vanguard of the fleet is no laughing matter, and certainly interacting with admirals is only for qualified personnel.<br />
*Commander Bachar nods knowingly*<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: Zox and his team beam down onto the outskirts of a large industrial plant on Ilitz Prime, following the coordinates from Dr. Malov's email<br />

>As they approach the facility, they see a large crowd of people carrying signs in a variety of alien languages with slogans like: "12 hour workday", "End slavery", "Don't kill our families", "We want dental", and other such sloganeering<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Hrm interesting. I think we can use this to our advantage.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let's do a bit of reconnoiting and see if we can figure out what's going on here. <br />
*Hailey Murry: Hailey's immediate instinct is to order everyone to split up, but then looks at the group and gives it a second thought.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Well, you need a name first. Then whatever that name is, you are the scab chemist that will fill these jobs using your advanced chemistry. Then we can get what we need here, which is whatever is inside there.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** ...I mean, unless you have a better plan.<br />

**Candles:** It's workers demanding a decent work-life balance and proper care for providing labor. How noble and wonderful.<br />
>Murry starts mingling with the crowd and a plant worker approaches her carrying an armful of disruptor rifles, offering one to her<br />

**Plant Worker:** Are you here to stand on the picket line brothers and sisters?<br />
*Candles gets out dental supplies to offer free dental checkups.*<br />
**Candles:** No no, I'm a lover, not a fighter.<br />
**Candles:** Specifically a lover of teeth.<br />
*Candles looks at his teeth.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I am thinking about it, but most picket lines don't have disrupter rifles being passed out. What's happening here?<br />
**Plant Worker:** We're on strike<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And the, uh...<br />
*Zoxar hangs his dino-head in shame. Turning down free disruptor rifles...yeesh.*<br />
*Hailey Murry gestures at the disrupter rifles*<br />
**Plant Worker:** Oh, perfect timing. Dr. Malov is about to speak<br />
*Plant Worker shushes Murry*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** If I could have everyone's attention please: The votes have been tallied, and we are prepared to submit the Union's demands to management. As we have discussed and agreed, we have four demands we will be transmitting to Jasanis:<br />
**Dr. Malov:** First: Whereas 30% of the current workforce of the refinery is slave labor, we demand that the slaves are freed<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Second: Whereas 40% of the current workforce, myself included, are being controlled through threats against our families, we demand that our families are released and the Orions stop threatening to kill them<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Third: For all workers, we demand an immediate 12% pay increase, along with future pay increases each year in line with cost of living.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Fourth: Whereas this is a highly dangerous facility: we demand that we be provided with healthcare coverage, and that safety concerns like unshielded radiation sources, and prior fatal containment breaches, be properly addressed.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** It may sound crazy now, but every labor movement has had to overcome recalcitrant management. Jasanis is desparate: Her erratic behavior and refusal to accept even minor delays makes it clear that she needs this ketracel white to be delivered tomorrow.<br />
*Candles gets ready for emergency beam out and looks for the nearest photon bomb shelter.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** That gives us leverage, with the guards here out of the way, we control that ketracel white, and if she wants to leave with it, she will have to negotiate with us on our demands.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** We must be strong, unified, and unwavering if we are going to be successful. But if we act as one, we can build a better future for ourselves.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** I think I like this guy.<br />
**Candles:** I think everyone here is about to die.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We concur Nurse Kolea. Surely Jasanis will not negotiate<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(to the group)*: Well, I think we have someone to talk to now. Though we're going to have to get to him before Jasanis's hitman does.<br />
**Plant Worker:** Where it is going is that we are going to get some concessions from management<br />
**Plant Worker:** You need to have faith brothers and sisters in labor<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Who's supplying the disrupter rifles? <br />
**Throk:** Throk not in this scene, but Throk do like Concession Stand food. Good luck getting Concessions, look like line might be pretty long.<br />
**Plant Worker:** They were generously supplied by the guards we overpowered, and their weapons locker<br />
**Candles:** Well done. Have you considered moving inside near the manufacturing facility and sensitive equipment so the risk of collateral damage is much higher to Jasanis' operations, because right now this crowd is just waiting to be hit with an orbital strike.<br />
**Plant Worker:** Jasanis will not arrive until tomorrow, but we will retreat to the plant before she does<br />
**Candles:** Oh, and replace all the regulators and life support equipment, because there is a very large chance that is rigged to poison everyone.<br />
**Plant Worker:** She cannot dare strike the plant from orbit or she would destroy her ketracel white<br />
>[TURN] Hadija Zawadi<br />

>[ROUND 3]<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This is really well organized. Is that Dr Malov fellow the one organizing everything?<br />
**Candles:** Also purge the memory banks on any food replicators and reload them from defaults because those will also generate low level addictive toxins.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** have you considered buffering the plant or the storage area against transportation, such that you retain the bargaining chips?<br />
**Plant Worker:** I am just handing out disruptor rifles, I am not sure what the plan is<br />
**Candles:** Good call, shields would be handy, I think an engineer I know would suggest changing the modulator frequencies every Cube root of 27 + rand int divided by 2 minutes.<br />
**Plant Worker:** You would need to talk to Dr. Malov on that one<br />
*Candles takes notes.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you for the assistance<br />
**Candles:** We will do so, carry on. Also, try to chew evenly, you are showing a little too much wear on your right side compared to your left.<br />
*Plant Worker self consciously rubs his jaw as he leaves*<br />
**Candles:** Do any of you know this Dr. Malov guy? I was busy giving the Captain massages for most of that episode so I never met him before. Hopefully he is not one of those people who think all Orion women look the same.<br />
*Candles directs her question to the Away team.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I watched Jasanis shoot him in front of us. Disintegrated him. Which means this is pretty suspcious. Kolea? He would probably remember me and Zox, we were there when he was abducted or killed. Can you arrange for a meeting with him?<br />

**Dr. Malov:** It was clear to me that Jasanis needed the white exactly on-time when she threatened to kill my entire family after I asked for a 2 day extension<br />
**Dr. Malov:** So I decided that gave us leverage to make some demands<br />
*Dr. Malov shrugs*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Worst case scenario: she kills us all<br />

**Dr. Malov:** Jasanis kidnapped me from Skana-IV and faked my death<br />
**Candles:** Jasanis has been trying to replicate ketracell white for years?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** She used a disruptor rigged to fire transporter tags to kidnap me and make it look like I'd been killed<br />
**Candles:** Ah yes, that was in the report I read.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zoxar): the only cannon use of it is for Jem'Hadar.</font><br />
**Candles:** It was in footnote 14 of the report, underneath the comment about dirt being in the door relays leading to your lab and its detrimental effect on the door opening.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Well I don't know all the details, but at some point during the war, when Starfleet mined the wormhole, the Founders needed production facilities in the alpha quadrant<br />
*Candles obviously was reading a report written by Skig.*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Somehow, they ended up contracting with the Aldazed cartel to refine it here<br />
**Dr. Malov:** But Jasanis only knew how to perform the final refining step, my research on Skana-IV had worked out how to produce the chemical precursors<br />
>As Murry, Kolea and Dr. Malov chat, a fight breaks out in the crowd between a pair of Miradorn and a Klingon woman<br />

**K'Tat Denellan:** Why am I not surprised to see you people here<br />
**Kolea:** Why am I surprised to always get interrupted or have an audience?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Because this is a PG-13 rated show on a 9:00 PM timeslot, they can't show gratuitous sex scenes or it would upset sponsors<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Don't you know anything about business?<br />

**K'Tat Denellan:** Don't you federation types believe in rights!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Rights are for citizens, not criminals.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Innocent until proven guilty!<br />
*Kolea looks at Dr. Malov.*<br />
**Kolea:** Don't worry Doctor, you will get plenty of penetration opportunities shortly.<br />

**Kolea:** No kidding, that type of rubber is known to cause a horrible allergic reaction to Ferengi intestinal tracts.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps the chef's hat is cutting of circulation to his head<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** He does seem to go a bit crazy whenever we are under cover<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Maybe you are right, but there's no Federation personnel here. <br />
*Zoxar winks*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I'm actually a Federation citizen<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, he will probably develop nasty rectal hemmorhaging combined with the inability to consume any form of animal based protein for a couple weeks.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** And I am gathering from context that you are all Starfleet officers, although apparently not very good ones<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Are you here to rescue me?<br />
**Kolea:** Right, we need to get you out of here doctor.<br />
**Kolea:** Come with me if you want to live.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** I can't leave until we secure labor rights for the workers here<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Including K'Tat<br />
**Dr. Malov:** He is a victim of Jasanis as much as I am <br />
**Kolea:** Very noble of you doctor.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Even though he is less sympathetic<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** K'Tat, what was the problem you mentioned?<br />
**Kolea:** I feel you deserve extra shagging for that nobility of spirit.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Get this big lizard off me and maybe I'll tell you<br />
**Kolea:** But not while everyone else is in the room.<br />
**Kolea:** Off or out?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** BOTH<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Fair.<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, are you okay with that allergen coated glove where it is?<br />
*Kolea gets out pencil and paper.*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** We can worry about that later<br />
**Kolea:** Describe your inetractions wit your father.<br />
*K'Tat Denellan stands up and pulls his pants back up while glaring angrily at Zox*<br />
**Kolea:** Describe your interactions with your father.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** As I was saying before I was violently assaulted by this brute, Jasanis received our demands and I don't think she took it well<br />
**Kolea:** As problems go, that would be 100% expected.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh, she most definitely would not have<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Her ship changed course to come straight here at high warp, and she has been hailing continuously for the past several minutes<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Lace the white with something and appear to yield.<br />
**Kolea:** I like white lacy things.<br />
**Dr. Malov:** The white is our only bargaining chip, if you contaminate it she would have no reason not to kill us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh? Just a few minutes ago? <br />
*K'Tat Denellan holds up a PADD flashing with a hailing indication from Jasanis*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I don't want to talk to her<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Dr. Malov, you are an expert; surely you can concoct some subtle way to tamper with it that will not be discovered before it is too late, and everyone here cab be evacuated?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** To what end? I don't care what she does with the ketracel white, I want to try to improve the working conditions for the people in this facility<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Should I answer her?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** You're a surprisingly wholesome person, Doctor<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think you should, she turned around only minutes ago, not hours, is that right K'Tat?<br />
**Kolea:** Also, we are NOT here.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Yes, she changed course directly here as soon as the Dr. transmitted our demands<br />
**Dr. Malov:** points the camera to avoid the crew and answers teh call<br />
*Dr. Malov points the camera to avoid the crew and answers teh call*<br />
>Before he can say anything, Jasanis starts screaming at him<br />

**Jasanis:** You snivelling little shit bag Federation trash !<br />
*Kolea turns on "record" on her tricoder.*<br />
**Jasanis:** I don't even have time to come kill you properly! Do you have any idea what you are doing to my timeline right now you fucking living garbage dump?<br />
*Jasanis screams incoherently*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** We just have some basic demands for...<br />
**Jasanis:** DEMANDS!<br />
*Kolea mouths the words, "requests"*<br />
*Jasanis laughs maniacally*<br />
**Jasanis:** I DEMAND that you are dead before I get there, so you don't FUCK UP my schedule<br />
*Jasanis starts angrily tapping away on a console while muttering under her breath*<br />
**Jasanis:** Good luck doctor<br />
*Jasanis terminates the channel*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** It doesn't sound like she is in the mood to negotiate<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Management never is, but every labor movement has had challenges<br />
*Kolea waits for Zox to shoot the PADD with a phasor set to disintegrate before it can self-destruct.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Most management won't threaten to kill you so openly<br />
*Kolea hands Murry a book about Labor Movements in the US in the 1890s and early 1900s.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Tamper with the KW shipment so it destroys Jasanis' ship in a way that looks like an accident with volitile compounts, then change this operation to a cosmetics factory?<br />
>As the crew discuss Jasanis' message, they hear the rising crescendo of distant screams of agony, howls of pain, and cries of terror, echoing through the facility. <br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** She also definitely has a sniper on hire, someone who's willing to do things the subtle and dirty way or the obvious and dirty way<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What's... what's that sound?<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Oh no<br />
**Kolea:** Contingency Plan C.<br />
*Dr. Malov checks his terminal*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** She shut down the containment field<br />
*Dr. Malov locks the doors to his quarters*<br />
**Dr. Malov:** This is not good, really, really not good<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Perhaps now would be a good time to take you up on the offer to leave<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What's out there?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Dr Malov, what is out there?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Why do you need a containment field?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): Cue fade to black for commercial break!</font><br />
**Dr. Malov:** Well, it turns out that the final refinement of Ketracel White requires a fairly exotic substance to stabilize the reaction<br />
**Dr. Malov:** Changeling morphogenic matrix<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Uhuh? <br />
**Dr. Malov:** The trouble is containing the stuff, since it's highly intelligent and doesn't like it<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Ketracel White is People?! <br />
