>INTERIOR - Cardassian Medical Ship: T'Kor stares at the room full of Cardiassians in medical stasis tubes, unsure whether they would be considered legal salvage. Down the hall, Skig ponders the forcefield blocking her path as she follows the path of the ODN line that T'Kor severed. Meanwhile, a few meters away Tal'oran realizes that she is beginning to "trip balls" as the unknown substance that Windbloom gave her begins to take effect.<br />

**Zox:  [2d20 = 32]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm... T'Kor, have you seen Windbloom or Tal'oran? I am not reaching them on comms. Also, have you found anything there? Here there is some sort of forcefield.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor** Do medical stasis tubes count as salvage if they still have occupants? Or would they be considered the property of the occupants?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor** Also, I don't see Windbloom or Tal'oran, but let me go check on them. If their comms aren't working, that may indicate an issue with reception. I might advise we both check together, in case force fields are separating us. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I think we should take them and their occupants back to the Lister, it is a somewhat grey area given jurisdiction and circumstances, but whoever they are might have useful information. Or might wonder why they have been in a junkyard for very long time.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I agree, there is definitely a problem with reception. The desk here is marked, "wait here, out for lunch" but it is covered in a thick layer of dust.<br />
**Tal'oran ** *(severely_winded)*: Hey team, sorry, had a run in. All better <cough> now, headed to your position<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor** What sort of run-in?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Can you make sure he comes with you and we will meet with T'kor and the popcisles.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** ... popsicles?<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Bachar assembles the senior staff for a briefing to review the evidence they have gathered regarding the murder of Kolaakor and the attack on Kolea. Murry pulled transporter records, Zox downloaded Kolaakor's ledge of transactions and the security footage from around the site of the escape pod, and Viraseti ran a sensor sweep for nearby ion trails or warp signatures<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** My scans were negative, no other vessels have been in the vicinity since we arrived. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** The assailant came from the Lister, using an escape pod from near MedBay. Then someone else re-sealed the escape pod hatch from on the Lister to hide the fact it had launched from here.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Which would imply that someone else might be the one tampering with the logs if they launched Krepeka over and then remained here to cover her tracks.<br />

This ship's command structure is kind of confusing if I'm honest. Anyways, um... It isn't quite right that you have to reseal the escape pod hatches externally. You may have forgotten taking your evacuation procedures exam from whenever you were at the academy, but I took mine not that long ago, and I scored second in my class. Um, but anyways the pod has a hatch override control which can be used from inside the launch chamber to reseal the hatch from the inside.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I wonder if it's possible that Krepeka was replaced with Zerra at some point...<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm not sure. It's also possible that Krepeka got something else mixed up when fused with them. Or... potentially if it can be triggered remotely...?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** The strings work like remote forwarding. When two minds are linked, each brain operates as normal in its original body, and the string links the sensory and motor cortex. So if two people are linked by a cosmic string, their minds are operating in their original bodies and it is just the sensory and motor systems that are being "forwarded" across space<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** It is a fascinating technology, when this is all done I plan to write a research paper on it.<br />
