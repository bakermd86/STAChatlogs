>Captains Log, Stardate 61857.6: It still feels strange to be recording these... We are still awaiting our next assignment at Starbase 34. Murry is heading up the investigation in the meantime. Our situation is currently.. complicated.

> Nurse Krepeka's body is in the brig, under the control of a crazed Vulcan bio-terrorist. Her mind is stuck in Dr. Zerra's body, who is still MIA. The Twins launched themselves towards Earth in a Type-8 probe, without permission or explanation.

> I guess it would be too much to ask for to take it easy in my first week as a starship captain. Hopefully Murry and her team find a thread we can pull on, I don't want to spend any longer docked at the Starbase than necessary.<br />

>INTERIOR - Conference Room: Murry has converted one of the diplomatic conference rooms on Deck 4 into an investigation center. PADDs containing all the various documents and findings of the investigation are scattered about the table, and Malat has 2 security guards posted at the door to ensure the room remains secure. <br />

*Skig walks in covered in "Star Trek Engine Grease" and looking annoyed, muttering something about "What do they teach Chief Engineers these days".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** So, what do we think of the Twins? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I can't believe they were in on it too.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** They know everything we know, we need to track them down<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** And break their tiny little knees<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure if they were<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Neraran didn't rely on them, and they seemed just as caught by the chemicals as the rest of us<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Then again, she is nuts<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** They went AWOL in the middle of a crisis hidden in a probe, hardly innocent behavior<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It is quite possible they believe there is an imminent threat to Starfleet and as they might not have had faith in the Lister being able to relay or deal with the situation decided to foresake the Lister in favor of warning Starfleet.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Very much that.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Well I still way we track them down and rough them up a little<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Also, it's possible one of them might not agree on a course of action, but they exist as a team. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think they deserve some roughing up at least, they could've left a more comprehensive set of notes<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We have a nice blob of Breen in the Brig you are welcome to punch whenever you feel the urge Lt Commander Malat.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** In any case, Ms Murry, what have you discovered that we can act on?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart:** Wow, why all the harsh words shipmates. No need to be so violent<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** You have a lot of work ahead of you Windbloom.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, we've got a few things of note. T'kor reported that he found a device from the twins, and that he'd been monitoring their navigation-based comms<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I hate to be coldblooded, but violence has been a way of life here.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Neraran nuked Zerra's office. Were we able to recover anything from the wreckage?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart:** Violence is a poison man, you've got to detox your soul<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Well, Kolea put the fire out pretty quickly. But the only thing Neraran torched was a supply closet full of bacteria<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** I don't know that a bunch of petri dishes of bacteria are worth anything to begin with<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Geret may know more about this stuff. She was sneaking around pretty effectively.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** They would be amazingly useful to a bioweapons expert plotting to create all sorts of nefarious things to disable or kill a mixed crew like ours.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Whole thing seemed fairly...baroque? Why bother to engineer bacteria when there's replicators. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** At least, that's my guess from my "well-rounded cadet courses" in biology that I had to take.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** If we can have someone look into the resources that were put into Zerra's research, especially recently, that would be great. Any digital logs as well. I'm hoping we can reverse engineer this, because Zerra is stil lout there, and I do believe he was involved in a biological weapons scandal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Probably because replicators cannot generate bioweapons, but you can grow them if you know what you are doing?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I mean, they do have safety protocols on them, at least, usually.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pokes her head through the door*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I hope I'm not interrupting<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Not at all, come on in<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Something very odd happened this morning when I went to replicate my breakfast<br />
*Skig looks annoyed that engineering has another issue which has not been corrected.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** There was a pattern lodged in the buffer, and it materialized this inside my breakfast<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Oh that's horrifying<br />
*Skig wonders if we should all don hazmat suits.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** This seems like a security issue.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti places a glass of Mango Lassi on the table, inside the glass is a flip-up notepad with "Tell Zox what you told Zerra" written on it*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): "im okay with this"</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Huh<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I assume it must have been the Twins<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know who else could manually program such a precise replicator pattern directly into the output buffer<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Kolea really wants to know why someone wants Viraseti to have "pillow talk" with Zox and if this will make Murry jealous.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Was this directed at you? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It must be, it was in the replicator in my quarters<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Zox and I can take a look at the replicator for other issues on a security/engineering standpoint. We can also pull the logs for the replicator to see how it was applied to the output buffer.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think we just replace the entire replicator set while we are here. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** How often to do you use it? And has your salad been more fibrous than normal?<br />
*Skig wonders how many copies of the note Viraseti ate before she noticed it.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I usually eat in the mess, this was the first thing I replicated in my quarters since we got back to Starbase<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We could upgrade her to one of those new RFG-9000s like we put in Throk's room. The one that can replicate a whole smoked targ.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** We have a few dozen in storage for some reason.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Adds to the olde timey feel, much like starship captains raising grapes, for some reason.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I am not sure what the note is referring to, but if I had to guess it is probably about the warp signature. Which means that the Twins were spying on us when we... Those little perverts<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti turns red with some mix of anger and embarassment*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I think that is because they had to use a VPN to get around the age limitation on PornHub and routed it through Zerra's room.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, at the very least it sounds like the Twins weren't on the same page as Zerra and Neraran <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think one of them was<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** And one of them wasn't<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** but it's impossible to defect against your twin.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Conceiveable, since they are a "re-forged pair" since they both lost their original matched Bynar.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat:** Only way to find out is to track them down and break their legs<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** We do not have to break their legs, Malat<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Save that for Zerra<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Is it safe to say that we've sent out a warning for someone bearing Neraran's description? </font><br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Or have we not done that yet?</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know what it has to do with anything, but the only thing I can think that the note would be referring to would be the warp signature from the blackhole near the Sulani cluster<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Ah, that anomaly? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Please elaborate<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, when we encountered the Jem'Hadar there, they gave us sensor records of a Starfleet warp signature they had detected absconding with one of their vessels just before we arrived<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The warp signature clearly looked like a Starfleet vessel, but it didn't match any current Starfleet ships<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I eventually found that while the primary signature looked like a Starfleet vessel, the secondary and tertiary harmonics didn't match<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Did they match other patterns?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Meaning that the primary warp signature was a fake, broadcast over the real signature to disguise it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I couldn't find a match, they won't have the halmark energy signature Starfleet warp signatures<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They could be Klingon, Cardassian, Breen... Just about any other fleet that uses laser-induced fusion injectors<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pulls out a PADD*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The red portion is the primary signature, which I believe is falsified. And the higher order harmonics appear to be legitimate<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't know what this has to do with anything though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** This would definitely be a way to make someone think that a Star Fleet vessel has just warped into their area though, wouldn't it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, anyone reading this warp signature would certainly believe it belonged to a Starfleet vessel<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Look on the bright side: at least your density no longer fluctuates with temperature. How do you replicate clothes that fit if your size relative to your mass changes every day based on the environmental controls? <br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): I think we should do a scan of the rest of the crew, just in case. We can pass it off as being just routine post-Neraran check to make sure they didn't get infected with a biological weapon</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Curious, I mean, it would be interesting to extract it for further examination, but I'm not entirely sure what that would do to people, as we are not entirely sure what it is.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Don't be silly, standard operating procedure under the Starfleet manual of ship operations is to set environmental controls between 17 and 25 C depending on local environmental conditions if in orbit of a planet. So even when environmental controls are working normally, there is (in fact) a significant range of available temperatures available to the operations officer to set. <br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): With that ETC check, Kolea is asserting dominance of, "Yes, I run this Sickbay with extreme efficiency, even when wearing bunny slippers and skin tight clothing."</font><br />
>Over the course of a few hours, Kolea and Krepeka rotate the entire crew through Sickbay to run brain scans on all 400 of them. People are confused why Dr. Zerra is assisting Nurse Kolea instead of the other way around, but by converting several med bays into neurological scanners, they are able to complete the process very quickly<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I am even less confused about how transporters work with brain structures. I'd say my brain is jelly after today, but that'd just be nostalgic.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** ...but this is still confusing.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Well Lt Cmdr Murry and Captain Bachar, as you asked to have this scan performed and it is relevant, I believe it is important to report that everyone who went through the body swapping process has this strange nodule, including the Captain, which seems to be in a semi-solid state in your otherwise fluidic body, captain.<br />
*Kolea is telling this specifically to Murry and Captain Bachar, by themselves, in a faraday sealed room, FYI.*<br />
<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): Are the nodules in Zerra and Krepeka the same size as the rest of ours? </font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Also, can we get Chief Engineer T'Kor to figure out why the D-Batteries I get from my replicator only last about 30 minutes? You know, for reasons.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Not really relevant, but I just thought of it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** No, I would rather he figure out whether that device he discovered in the transporters could have caused these <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** No problem, it can wait.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I think that would be a good avenue of investigation after this.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Dr. Zerra's official report on Murry's condition from back then says: "The mechanism by which the cosmic string caused Lt.

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Given his actions, I wonder now if he is being entirely honest there<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** This guy is just sloppy, overwhemled by the gravity of the whole situation.<br />

*T'kor skitters into the room with a pile of reports*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I've finished that report for you, sir<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I suspect some method other than the cosmic string would be the resultant factor - which leads me to suspect we might want to unseal and further research the events of that particular situation if Murrey concurs.<br />
*T'kor hands Kolea a pile of reports labeled "D-Crisis"*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Goddamnit T'Kor, did you really think that was important enough to work on right now?<br />
*Kolea looks at reports and is annoyed to discover that her Orion Syndicate "Stress Relievers" are too powerful for wimpy Starfleet D-Batteries.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I guess I should have bought one of the gas powered pull start options on Empok Nor.<br />

*Dr. Zerra is puzzled at using primitive chemistry to produce a current.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I think a censor just fell over dead, and I was not even specific. This new time slot is interesting.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I was told it was of top importance. Also, I have recommendations on a variety of methods for alternative power sources and diagrams for how to modify the device for up to three times as much output<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Don' do it! We need a nurse!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Excellent. I would hug you if it would not be lethal to both of us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I'll be looking into this device next, it's quite curious<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Now that this, ahem, mostly unimportant situation is resolved, the Captain was curious about your investigations into the strange device located in the Transporter Room.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Please say it's fixed and you can get me back to normal!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Wait, I mean get ME back to normal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** T'Kor, put investigation on Kolea's "devices" on hold and see what you can find out about the device you found in the transporter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** At a minimum: I would like to find a way to put Krepeka back into her own body<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** To be honest, keeping Neraran in a bowl of semi-frozen lime jello is the best way to keep her under control.<br />
*Zox Walks in...*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Having reviewed her personnel file, her not having arms or legs seems beneficial to the rest of us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, at the very least we have a way of checking if someone has been body swapped<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Imma have to say, no, we need to subject Neraran to....interrogation.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Well speaking of Neraran... Her attorney filed a motion for her charges to be handled by JAG on Earth, rather than here on the Lister. So when we get back, we are going to have to remand custody<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** What? That's not good!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** They can't be trusted with this.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I am curious how she was assigned an attorney at all, given that she has not had access to any sort of communication equipment, or even a head, since I trapped her goo form in a refrigerator.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Can't we just keep Neraran's mind in some strange body and hand over a fake?<br />
*Kolea looks at Dr Zerra.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Under regulations, even she is entitled to a fair trial. Her attorney argued that she can't get an impartial judgement in a field hearing overseen by a captain who she tried to kill barely a week earlier<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** No offense to your normal state of existence of course.<br />
*Captain Bachar narrows her eyes at Zox*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** I don't think Krepeka would be OK with facing charges on her behal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** So T'kor, can you get me back?<br />
*Kolea smiles politely to Bachar.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I think I meant to put Neraran's mind into like, the pet cat, and then hand over a husk of Zerra with a cat-brain in it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I can... I can try, but it would have to be in place of looking into the device I found<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** I can... I can try, but it would have to be in place of looking into the device I found<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** That one is easy Kolea, we were docked at a Starbase undergoing repairs and we had someone in custody in the brig. I had no choice but to file criminal charges in order to explain the detention<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I see. Did you state that Neraran or Dr Zerra was in the Brig?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Starfleet is very pendactic in their application of laws.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** I said there are "inexplicable circumstances" surrounding the accused<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Strangely there is a checkbox on the form to indicate that the body and mind are different individuals<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: Regarding Zox's suggestion: I think Zox and T'kor will have to make opposing Presence checks to see which use of T'Kor's time Bachar thinks is better</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Curious, well, then if we want to interrogate her, we need to put her back, which I believe will require an understanding of the machine T'Kor needs to look into.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Ah, I believe this is related to Hailey's experiences. It looks like the device has dozens of cosmic strings that are quantum bonded together. It's partnered with a pattern interferometer <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So they are using the cosmic strings to mic up brain patterns? I guess that explains why we ended up back in our own bodies when we slingshotted the blackhole<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** That seems a terribly circuitous way to do so.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Exactly. Though I believe that Hailey's experience of being thrown back in time is a more novel one. I believe that sort of report is one which may add more to our understanding of these strings. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** But why does it cause the strange anomaly in the brain pattern that seems to apply across all species exposed to it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Is the string applying some sort of temporal effect that marks people exposed to it across their brain patterns on a permanent basis?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well, I don't know what exact it is we are detecting in the brain, but a cosmic string is not just going to attach itself to your brain of its own accord. They must be anchoring it somehow<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** How did Hailey get hers? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Let me see these scans.....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Per Dr Zerra's notes, it was caused by her and her crewmate being exposed to the cosmic string, perhaps in a way "fusing" them together.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** As in, perhaps this is some sort of "anchor"?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Whatever they experienced was a 1 in a million random chance. For a cosmic string to get stuck on their brain tissue is possible, but extremely unlucky<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Based on Kolea's scans, this device seems to be an attempt to controllably replicate what happened, but in a more complete way<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Koron must have been involved in this, he researched Murry's brain scans after her incident<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** He claimed that the findings were "inconclusive"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Well we should speak to this Koron and find out what he and Zerra discovered<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Well based on what you're telling me: this device doesn't have an undo function. How do we put Krepeka back into her own body?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** And you'll need to come up with something soon, we will be back at earth in less than a day<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** Barbarically? We get Gra'lan to go find a punch card backup of Krepeka, filter the brain patterns out of it, then use a Vulcan mind transference ritual to move the consciousness from Dr. Zerra's body to the blank one, leaving Dr Zerra's body in a vegetative state.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Well, we could loop near a black hole<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Actually, that would be disasterous. That would almost certainly loop Neraran back into her own body. We'd gain Zerra, but lose the chemical warfare specialist<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar:** Yeah I don't love the idea of releasing Neraran back into the wild in her own body again<br />

<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor:** Could we not simply have them teleport together? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We could try, but it would be highly dangerous and experimental. The device would probably attach a second cosmic string, resulting in an unpredictable outcome<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea:** I mean, there is a Shanat Korr device that rends brain patterns from people and displaces them into a transient form that results in them experiencing constant neural fire to nonexistent nerve endings until they can be projected back into a suitable host corpse for furhter interrogation. But I doubt we would have access to that, since it is outlawed every where except for suspected traitors of the Tal'Shiar.<br />

>INTERIOR - Ol' Faithless: Ghex pilots the dubiously space-worthy shuttle out of of orbit, taking care not to incinerate the now dubiously air-worthy shuttle in the transition to atmospheric flight. Skig, Zox and Oakadan man the shuttle's other stations as they begin search operations over North Africa<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Wow, this shuttle has a lot more warning lights illuminated than I am used to. Is it going to explode? I am not really comfortable with vessels I am piloting exploding. It's never happened before.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Well, actually that's not quite true. It's happened once before, but that wasn't my fault and even my instructor said so. She said that the tech manual figure for the pressure tolerance of a type-9 shuttle craft was written given in absolute pressure, but the shuttle display defaults to gauge pressure, which is OBVIOUSLY a lot lower since the shuttle is pressurized. So I didn't even lose points on my shuttle classification exam.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Although I did get docked on my engineering competency score, because I didn't know the difference between aboslute pressure and gauge pressure. But you'd think that they would at least make sure that the display matched the text book?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex:** Sorry, am I talking too much? People tell me sometimes I talk too much, especially when I'm nervous like when I am put on an away mission with the First Officer and the scary officer on my first day piloting a not-at-all standard shuttle through an atmostpheric reentry to some unfamiliar planet. I'll shut up now.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Wait...who is scary here?<br />

**GM:** That is basically a retcon, which we have treated as a determination spend + a roll to set up a scene trait. So you can attempt, but it will cost 1 determination and then require a successful fitness/command from Geret to get the message to her, and a fitness/conn from Viraseti to get back up to the 104th floor before the Trill woman leaps from the building<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: After both away teams had returned to the Lister (and Kolea had returned some of her organs and blood to her abdomen), they briefed Captain Bachar and the other senior staff about the events at Starfleet Medical and in Marakesh. Zox is still holding Cache in his lap, having not had time to put him away somewhere more suitable before the briefing.<br />

>After listening to the reports, Captain Bachar picks up the sample collection vial and turns it over in her hand for a moment before speaking.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Yeah, that is super weird and creepy, I wouldn't do it either. I mean: why does this Cardassian even want your blood? I can't imagine it is anything good. Do you think it's some weird sexual thing? I bet that...<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Juan.png" alt="Juan Toby" width="50" height="50">**Juan Toby** We believe you have misunderstood. Our appearance as Juan Toby must be due to tampering by the crew, this device is supposed to use a holographic representation of ourselves<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Juan.png" alt="Juan Toby" width="50" height="50">**Juan Toby** Actually, that is part of why we are contacting you. We will be leaving shortly and would like to collect Cache now that we have the opportunity. When we are finished here, please place him into the replicator so that we can use its pattern scanner to lock onto him<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** To be fair, trust is a quantity in low supply around here.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Murry, Zox, here's your chance, ask questions while I buy you all time.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Who're you working with? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** What exactly is so dangerous about these mundane bacteria and novelty proteins that merited a covert purge?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Sam Haggarty, some of your crewmates have met him, not sure who and how many are working for him<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** But he is still getting active intel from the Lister, so I couldn't risk speaking out in the open<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** He is the only one that can supply my serum, for now<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I will see what I can do about that.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** As for these bacteria, I have no idea. I am not a scientist, all I know is they are using it for communcation somehow<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh, that is fantatic!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Is Sam with Dr Zerra?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** My orders were just to wait until you all had entered deck 103.5, destroy the sequences and the clomputer, and then get out <br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Sam is on a mission on Antin IV<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I don't know what he is doing there, but your doctor is probably with the other scientists<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What other scientists?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** A dozen or so others from the morphophage project, they evactuated the facility at Starfleet medical a few days ago<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** The facility on level 103.5?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Yeah. Sam figured you were going to find it, so he transfered them somewhere else and left me behind to make sure you found the facility, but destroy all the biological materials<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Any idea what the purpose of the morphophage project is?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Was. We created the virus that nearly exterminated the Founders during the war<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** The project ended when the war did, but Sam started running some new op a couple years ago, recruited a bunch of us to be involved<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** And blackmailed you into it? <br />
*Trill Female sighs*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I got myself into this mess. I felt guilty about having attempted genocide, turned myself in to the authorities on Trill<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** The Symbiosis Commission didn't want a scandal, so instead of a trial and conviction they just removed my symbiote, blocked his memories of me, and put me on a transport to die slowly of organ failure somewhere else<br />
*Kolea feels way more empathy than is easily explainable without plot exposition.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** And Sam found you and had a serum that would keep you going?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Sam found me, offered me a deal. I have no idea where he gets that serum, but it keeps me from dying of organ failure so I do what he tells me.<br />
*Trill Female nods*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Fair<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you know anything about Jem Hadar weapons? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Yeah, I orchestrated the deal with Jasanis and those peacenic Jem'Hadar to get the particle canisters<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I don't know what they're for, but probably nothing good<br />
*Kolea nods as the puzzle pieces fit together.*<br />
*Kolea checks her medical tricoder for signs that security is snooping around.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Any idea on what the Twins are on about? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I don't know, they aren't the type that Sam would want to work with<br />

<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Yes, actually.. She was an asset we developed in the Obsidian order during the war. She was on the outs with the leadership at the time because of some internal political bullshit<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** That I have no idea ma'am<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: After both away teams had returned to the Lister (and Kolea had returned some of her organs and blood to her abdomen), they briefed Captain Bachar and the other senior staff about the events at Starfleet Medical and in Marakesh. Zox is still holding Cache in his lap, having not had time to put him away somewhere more suitable before the briefing.<br />

>After listening to the reports, Captain Bachar picks up the sample collection vial and turns it over in her hand for a moment before speaking.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I think it goes without saying that I'm not giving this Cardassian any biological samples.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Yeah, that is super weird and creepy, I wouldn't do it either. I mean: why does this Cardassian even want your blood? I can't imagine it is anything good. Do you think it's some weird sexual thing? I bet that...<br />

*Kolea has to take notes, because Skig sure does not.*<br />
*Skig has no idea what Kolea is talking about, she has just finished filling out some updated procurement forms for additional supplies needed for engineering, now what is the purpose of this meeting again?*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Someone really likes partially broken characters. A doctor missing a brother, a binar missing a twin, a trill missing a symbiote.....<br />
