>INTERIOR - Solidarity Brig: Four Nausicaans shove the Lister officers into a brig which appears to be a converted torture room, and activate the forcefield locking the prisoners inside. The torture equipment has been removed from the cell and is haphazardly piled into a closet nearby. A small low-pile rug has been placed over the residue of a disintigrated body which has been burned into the deck, and a disruptor burn on the wall has been partially hidden by a motivational poster of a cat hanging from a branch taped over it.<br />

**Kolea:** You've got this Kitty!<br />
**Kolea:** Hey, when does Dr Malov get his conjugal visits?<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** The kitty represents the struggle of the oppressed working class<br />
*Nausicaan Brute activates the forcefield*<br />
**Kolea:** He can come any time.<br />
**Kolea:** I meant that multiple ways.<br />
*Nausicaan Brute is too stupid to understand the joke and stares blanky at Kolea*<br />
*Zox is disgusted at mammals in general.*<br />
**Kolea:** This is an annoying turn of events.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, here we are. <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed, this is not an ideal situation<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So I do still have a holdout disrupter, if we can get out of here. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Man, I got these big dinosaur muscles and no work to use them with. If only I could join the working class and become a pirate on the space seas!<br />

*Kolea is impressed by Murry's "prison pocket" and promises to not tell anyone where Murry keeps it, after shielding her from view of the others.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** All I ever wanted was an honest day's work and some non-gmo palm trees to nibble on.<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** We are not "pirates" reptile, we have something called a "private parts charter" from the Cardassians<br />
**Kolea:** Ooh, I love those!<br />
**Nausicaan Brute:** This is a legitimate union, enforcing Cardassian law in Cardassian space<br />
**Kolea:** Can I see if? Can we sign up and join the working class struggle?<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, this is a great thing.<br />

**Nausicaan Brute:** Hmm, maybe you are right. I will go talk to Dr. Malov, you wait here<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, this gets me out of dealing with all those Starfleet regulations and I can use laser saws again.<br />
*Nausicaan Brute is too stupid to resist 4 successes of presence and leaves the brig unattended*<br />
**Kolea:** Okay, any other ideas than joining the working class struggle?<br />
*Zox hulks out and does pushups, pull ups, and tail ups in the cell, flexing his unbelievable physical prowess that clearly belongs in the union.*<br />
**Kolea:** I'm fine with that, by the way.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Impressive, but were you planning to flex your way through the forcefield?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The forcefield is just a metaphor for worker exploitation - ephemeral and illusory, yet confining.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Metaphorical interpretations notwithstanding, it still prevents us from escaping<br />
**Kolea:** I was expecting him to try and burst through it and cause it to short out from voltage overload because this style of forcefield will overcharge itself cause a feedback loop when it begins conducting through a Voth's above average acidic copper sulphate blood levels.<br />
**Kolea:** But by suggesting that, I'm probably going to cause some bingo cards to get scratched off.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We will stand back before Commander Zox attempts anything of the sort<br />

*Zox lets out the wootle of 'computer not doing thing!'*<br />
>While the crew are considering their options, an alert klaxon blares out, and then the comms crackles to life<br />

**Dr. Malov:** All hands: the class traitors have escaped the brig! A small kaiju appeared in the bridge and told us they intend to take over the union!<br />
**Dr. Malov:** We must recapture them immediately!<br />
**Kolea:** Wait...<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Thanks!<br />
*Hailey Murry pockets the good disrupter pistol and looks at the bad ones in distaste*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We've gotta find K'tat before we go, we need those financing records<br />

**Kolea:** How convenient!<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I went to find you in your cells but you escaped<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Which is, helpful I guess<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I Wasn't sure how I was going to overpower the guard<br />
**Kolea:** Your quick wits and large lobes would have worked wonders.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Come, escape this ship with us!<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Yes! You gotta get me out of here<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** They formed a... Union!<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I had to play along so they wouldn't kill me<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** But they want to... redistribute wealth<br />
*K'Tat Denellan shudders*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do you have the financing details for Jasanis's account?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Some of them, not all<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How do we get all?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** But I know more than most<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Or, rather, the most recent stuff<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** The only person who knew anything on her new Nyberite accounts was Brovena<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** She closed out most of the Orion accounts after she paid off Paletor<br />
**Kolea:** We need to find Brovena then, fortunately we have her home address.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we can get there first. C'mon, we'll get you out of here and talk more<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Well, sadly she got disintigrated<br />
**Kolea:** But first we need to get out of here, we must practice premature ejection in warp.<br />
>As the crew discuss complex financial records, they come around a corner just outside the shuttle bay and run into several Nausicaans guarding the entrance<br />

*Kolea sighs.*<br />
**Kolea:** Great, Brovena gets disintegrated AND we have several Nausicans in our way.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Umm... Look! I captured them! I'm a hero to the working class!<br />
*K'Tat Denellan dives for cover*<br />
*Kolea throws herself to the ground.*<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps we should limit the counselor's access to weapons<br />

**K'Tat Denellan:** Malov didn't want to run afoul of the law, so the Solidarity applied for and recieved a Cardassian privateer charter<br />
**Kolea:** I have to admit, sex when artifical gravity is disabled is not nearly as exciting as it might sound.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Technically, by the letter of Cardassian law, they were operating legally under their charter to arrest you for violating Cardassian sovereign space<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is that why they arrested us?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ....okay.<br />
**Kolea:** Dr Malov is such a well prepared and intelligent union organizer.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Fine.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Now, if it isn't too much trouble, I'd like to be dropped at the nearest open port before you lot go back to your ship. Your federation is almost as bad as that... union<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** A little bit of information and that pays for your rescue, friend.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Fine, you want to know about Jasanis' accounts?<br />

*K'Tat Denellan pulls out a PADD and taps a few keys, then hands it over to Zox*<br />

*Zox carefully reviews the data K'tat is providing for authenticity.*<br />
**Kolea:** Who is the owner of the account everything was transferred to?<br />
*Kolea suspects K'Tat emptied all of Jasanis' accounts into one of his own after she was killed.*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** That would be Paletor, Jasanis paid off her debts and bought out her franchise<br />
**Kolea:** Hmm...<br />
*Kolea thinks to herself, "Why would a dead woman care whether her franchise was paid off or not?"*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And probably a front<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Even I don't know where her new accounts are, I just know that they are Nyberrite <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Very well, is there any place you prefer to be dropped off at?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Anywhere far from wherever you're going<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** With a spaceport<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I need to book passage back to Fenginar, explain to the FCA that I was forced to join the Union and did everything in my power to escape<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Before they discommend me for joining a union<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How would they know you joined a union?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Never underestimate the FCA<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, as I see it, you've paid for the rescue, but we might need a little bit more info to pay for extended travel<br />
**Kolea:** Ferengi can telepathically detect communism from a distance of 3 Light Years and the mere presence of it alters their DNA if they are subjected to membership of a union or a commune.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** What more do you want? I don't know where Jasanis is.<br />
**Kolea:** The Orions use it as a form of banishment torture on Ferengi who cross us.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** And good riddance, she shot me! And then ammended my health insurance policy not to cover my surgery!<br />
**Kolea:** A medical scan will show changes in K'Tat's brainwaves symptomatic of "close contact with anathema".<br />
*Kolea looks at K'Tat.*<br />
**Kolea:** You very specifically just did not refer to her in the past tense. Which means you know she is still alive, right?<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Of course, I saw her leave for Kazor Klan myself<br />
**Kolea:** Thanks.<br />
*Kolea whispers, "Good luck out there, sister".*<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** I don't know what happened after that, but I wouldn't put my money on her dying <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hm<br />
**Kolea:** So who was distintegrated at the payoff?<br />
**Kolea:** After I reconfigured the changeling suit to replicate Jasansi.<br />
**K'Tat Denellan:** Well Jasanis plays her cards pretty close to the vest, but I assume it was Brovena<br />
**Kolea:** Makes sense, fills in a few gaps. Thanks.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** You know<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Judging from this thing<br />
*Hailey Murry holds out the holdout pistol she got from Jasanis*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That might have just been a teleporter<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, this confirms a lot of suspicions.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We will drop you off at the closest neutral space port.<br />
**Kolea:** No, I'd guess she convinced Brovena to do the exchange somehow, and used the reconfigured changeling suit to cover her tracks.<br />
*K'Tat Denellan breathes a sigh of relief*<br />
**Kolea:** Dr Malov did say that Jasanis was being unnaturally pleasant after the left us on the planet and before the exchange we saw.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Clever move<br />
*Zox is appreciative that two people here can pick up on subtle emotions, rather than being reptiles.*<br />
**Kolea:** Given Jasanis, I wouldn't be surprised if neither of the people we saw in the video were responsible, but Jasanis ordering a hit on "herself" to give herself a clean getaway.<br />
**Kolea:** After all, I might have done the same thing in a previous life.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is a reasonable inference<br />
>The crew drop K'Tat off, and set course back to the Lister<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Course plotted, ETA 16 hours<br />
>INTERIOR - Orlana Conservation Research: Gra'lan, Oakadan, Viraseti and Dr. Gallego return from their assignments to meet back up in Atrium as agreed, but Skig is nowhere to be seen. Gra'lan and Viraseti are sweating from the exertion of their walk around the campus. Dr. Zerra can be seen flitting about in the distance, administering nausea meds to counteract the effects of the Ethyl Bromide that the researchers have been breathing.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Where is Lt. Commander Skig? We need to fill her in<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Computer: what the location of Lt. Commander Skig?<br />
**Computer Voice:** Lt. Commander Skig is in the residential wing, section 141<br />
**Oakadan:** Residential?<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti storms off impatiently to the location given by the computer, and hits the door chime on the quarters located there*<br />
>Yalak answers the door wearing a silk shirt with the top button undone, and Skig is seated at the dining table in the room behind him, having a glass of wine and picking at a charcuterie board<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** This is what you are doing while we were hiking through the woods taking scans?<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes. What did you find?<br />
**Oakadan:** Quite a lot of Tribbles<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You.. insufferable!<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti leaps over the table and tackles Skig to the deck in rage*<br />
