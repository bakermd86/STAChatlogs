>INTERIOR - Taganite Freighter: Kurij is dragging the unconsious Lt. Malat up the cliff face away from the torrent of oncoming water as Skig is carried away by the current. Kurij is pretty sure she saw Commander Bachar turn into a bird, but she is also pretty sure she is trying to avoid drowning in a hallucination.<br />

**Kurij:** How does this evEN MAKE SENSE?!<br />
*Cmdr Bachar runs over and helps Kurij drag Malat to safety*<br />
**Kurij:** You didn't just turn into a bird, did you?<br />
**Kurij:** Dumb question, I know, but dumb situations call for those sometimes<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** What the hell kind of a question is that? Skig is getting carried away by the water. Suggestions!<br />
*Ishemok glugging intensifies*<br />
**Kurij:** Does she even float? <br />
*Ishemok coughing intensifies*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar pulls out some smelling salts to wake Ishemok up*<br />

>MEANWHILE.... INTERIOR - Sickbay: Zox and Murry are escorted to Sickbay by Nurse Kolea to recieve medical care after their near death experience in the briefing room. Dr. Zerra is examining the patients brought over from the Taganite frieghter<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** My tail hurts<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well lets get you on the scanner and see what ails you<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Thank you, Dr Zerra<br />
*Dr. Zerra guides Zox onto a medical bed*<br />
**Kolea:** Hello Doctor. Zox seems to have developed several boo-boos and Counselor Murry's frontal lobe damage from her rampant alcoholism seems to have triggered some violent neurosis.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** What happened anyways? Nurse Kolea reported you all suffered from oxygen deprivation?<br />
**Kolea:** Oh, that also.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig broke my arm<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): I doubt anyone would believe that, but maybe...</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Zox has given me multiple concussions<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, Zox appears to have broken 2 bones in his arm, fractured his clavicle and his skull and ruptured one of his kidneys<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I can see why the entire crew of the other ship wound up dead<br />
*Dr. Zerra begins administering care to Zox and gets his arm set in a bone regenerator*<br />
*Kolea gets out the "chart of Zox injuries" that they keep on the inner board of the daily check sheet for Physician on Duty and checks off any new boxes.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Whew.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That should only take 10-15 minutes to set, but try not to break it again today<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): (BINGO!)</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's okay, the paleo diet keeps me healthy!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Nurse, make sure to note down the ruptured kidney. That's a new one.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And check if anyone has BINGO yet<br />
**Kolea:** Nurse Yulari has a bingo for kidney rupturing, I believe she gets the decorative floral arrangement.<br />
*Hailey Murry overlooks the clear conflict of interest in the medical bay having bets for injuries that people sustain*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Now, as for you Counselor. What is this about your frontal lobe?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I've been seeing things since earlier today, so I'd like to have that looked into. I thought it was just a migraine<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(quietly)*: It caused me to suplexed Kolea, so she's holding a grudge<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And Nurse Kolea mentioned alchoholism? You know, we do have a certified substance abuse counselor on board<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes, that would be me<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Let me check, her name is... Murry... Oh, right. Nevermind<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That's alright. It's not the alcohol, it's the grudge<br />
**Kolea:** I only hold grudges against slavers and women who steal my bedmates.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well if you're having headaches and hallucinations, we should probably have a look<br />
**Kolea:** And... well... you don't qualify for the second, so unless you are the first, we should be good. I'm just going off what the tricoder tells me.<br />
*Zox Suddenlty is grateful there aren't many other Orion on the lister.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Nurse Kolea, can you get out the Neural Scanner please<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Counselor Murry, have you had any prior brain surgery that isn't in your official medical file?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do recent concussions count? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Because otherwise, not that I'm aware of<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** No, this is old scar tissue.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** At least a few years, possibly 10-12 <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is difficult to know exactly when, but you have a lot of scarring along your prefrontal lobe<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that sounds pretty terrifying<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, it must have been here for a long time<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is so subtle it would have never been picked up in a standard physical<br />
*Dr. Zerra walks over to his computer*<br />
*Kolea notes on medical record, "Subject of brain experimentation she doesn't remember."*<br />
*Zox makes a note in his 'understand humans' journal on the origin of the phrase 'scared for life'.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Interesting, looking at your physical from when you came on board, there is a small shadown on the scan here. It isn't large enough to have been flagged at the time, but it is in the exact same location. So this scarring doesn't appear to be new.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But I don't see any evidence of incisions, or other scarring around the area<br />
*Hailey Murry is secretly quite relieved it's not some sort of recently developed brain-scarring*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I don't know how this scarring could have been caused, it would have required something to interact with your brain without having gone through your skull or surrounding tissues<br />
*Zox goes into hibernation.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Strange, then<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 enter sickbay looking rather perplexed*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commander Zox, we attempted to call you but comms appear to be offline<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** According to section 12.15, starfleet equipment may be used for non-intended purposes when the situation demands.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As you say. Notwithstanding... that... We noticed that someone overrode the security lockouts on the climate controls for the briefing room<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think Skig replaced all the batteries with cheap ones she got from Radio Shack. That's the reason it broke!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were attempting to report it as a potential security breach<br />
**Kolea:** Doctor, do you suppose it was performed via some sort of advanced inter-cranial operation via nanomachines fed into her via her nasal passages, which is the shortest route to the human brain and a cause of why Orion women can cause human females to behave violently due to our pheromone signature?<br />
*Zox immediately acts more professional.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That is a suspicously specific theory Nurse<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I must check out this problem immediately! Thank you for the update Cmdrs!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did they say the comms were offline as well?<br />

**Kolea:** When one is a slave working in the medical malpractice division of the Orion Syndicate, one does learn a few things.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well, I am afraid that is a little outside my area of expertise. All I can say is that whatever did this didn't cut through her skull to do it. It's as if it materialized in there<br />
**Kolea:** Interesting, pinpoint beaming of brain matter in and out via transporter has also been discussed; however, every medical journal I have seen on the matter has suggested it does not work to rehabilitate violent criminals without reducing them to a vegetative state.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, a transporter lobotomy would have probably caused some more noticeable side-effects in the Counselor<br />
**Kolea:** To be fair, those medical journals were also part of the Orion Syndicate Medical Professional Journal of "How To Deal With Federation Officers".<br />
*Kolea scratches head.*<br />
**Kolea:** Curious how we consider the Federation to be violent criminals.<br />
*Kolea shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps not a transporter then, there are many ways to pass solid objects through one another: phasic cloaks, spacial folding, subspace transit, transwarp tunnels, wormholes<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Although a wormhole in the Counselors brain seems unlikely<br />
**Kolea:** Good point. Perhaps vivisection is the best way to evaluate further. I'll prep the anesthetic.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I was going to say, those sound like they also have notable side effects<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think not right now, not when we've had sabotage happen so recently and have a ship we need to recover<br />

**Kolea:** Hmm... good point. I sometimes get overzealous in my pursuit of medical knowledge.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Nurse, let's run the same neural scan on our other two patients<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That response does not fill us with confidence Commander<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Even if it was only briefly, exposure to alien pathogens is always a risk<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** When did the glitch happen, Zox? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Unfortunately, I cannot give a precise time either<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Did it happen right when we were all in the room together, or was it something that happened earlier and had been gathering up? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Because the door also glitched out<br />

**Kolea:** Shouldn't Commander Bachar and the others be back by now?<br />
**Kolea:** They do seem to be taking a long time to transport back and forth from ships. I wonder if they decided to EVA instead?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I bet that no good Iskemok tried to sell them time-share property, or stole all their stuff. That rascal!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That seems like a reckless assumption<br />
**Kolea:** Zox, that is anunflattering thing to say about a fellow Starfleet officer. I'm sure he has done nothing worse than the normal 80-90 things that result in him spending time in the brig.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** I concur with the Counselor, we should try to raise the away team on comms<br />
**Kolea:** I believe this is covered in Ferengi Rules of Acquisition 1-115, excluding 8, 42, and 69.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we access the other ship's communications? <br />
**Kolea:** Maybe 13 also, but I get that confused with the Orion rules of courtship.<br />

**Kolea:** It's a little known fact that if you softly caress the back of a Bynar along their spine for 5 seconds, they will enter into a neural shutdown state where their cognitive abilities are not impacted and they will shut down gently during processing and we can come back later to retrieve them, as the Neurozine won't cause any sort of permanent damage.<br />
