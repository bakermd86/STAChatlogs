![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The tachyon pulse must have knocked some material into the black hole and triggered a gamma ray burst. My sensors are completely overloaded.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I have no control. Impulse engines offline, warp engines are not responding. We're falling into the gravity well!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Actually Lieutenant, that is a common misconception. It is not the gravity well itself that is the problem until you are nearly inside the event horizon. At this distance, the rotating black hole actually pulls on the spacet...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Not the right time Viraseti!<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** How long do we have until we fall into the black hole?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** At this rate, 12 minutes<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If we take into account the increasing time dilation as we continue on our current trajectory, we will measure it as 12 minutes but an outside observer would actually say we have 60-80 years<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long until we start accruing significant time dilation? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** At this rate of descent, our proper time won't dip below 10% for 8 minutes<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Our current proper time is 91%<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Captain, the gamma ray burst overloaded the primary and most of the secondary EPS conduits, power is still online but unable to transit from the warp core or generators to the engines.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So we've got about 8min to fix that<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I can reroute it via the remaining EPS conduits, as well as the tertiary control system from secondary engineering.<br />
*Skig gets up and heads off to due her normal miracle working things.*<br />
*Hailey Murry is concerned that this is going to be a very embarrassing situation if she gets time dilated for 10 years after rescuing Elin from her 10 year stasis*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What do you need us to do?<br />
*Zox looks for something to do.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Zox, I will need an emergency override of turbolift systems 4 and 7.<br />

Success with 2 momentum [3d20 = 30]**<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Impule and warp engines are back online<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Get us out of here Lieutenant<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm trying sir! Impulse engines are not strong enough, and I can't form a stable warp field this close to the black hole<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We're still being pulled in<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But more slowly, Skig's bought us at least a couple of hours<br />
*Skig frowns.*<br />
*Captain Baras shuts off the red alert klaxon*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** In that case, we have some time to figure things out<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Suggestions?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we tell how close the other ships are within the gravitational fields? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What if we overclock the warp computer and figure out a variance stabilizing algorithm so we can form stable warp bubbes even with a massive black hole pulling on it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will see if I can modulate the warp field on the Lister to account for the gravitic waves from the event horizon so we can form a warp bubble properly.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I liked Zox's idea also.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Forming a stable warp field in spacetime geometry this curved is incredibly difficult. It would be computationally infeasable to brute-force the necessary equations in the time remaining<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We would need a pre-computed warp field modulation<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It is time for a mixed-markov approach!<br />
*Zox puts on glasses contoured for a reptilian head.*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, can you get me a synopsis of the Boseman-Liteman hypothesis with a triangulated repeat of Scott's transwarp field modulation?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Twins, can you overlay a subset of existing pre-computed modulations based on Viraseti's results?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I'll see what I can do sir<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We would be pleased to try<br />
*Skig drinks some Earl Grey tea, as it is currently not time to panic.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We are approaching the Jem'Hadar Ships an the Crazy Horse at high...no relativistic speeds!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Relativistic speeds relative to them, or to the black hole?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ishemok, whatcha got for contraband electronics that can accelerate a solution to all this math they are groking?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Both, relatively speaking.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti and the twins get to work computing a warp field geometry and solving the relevant equations to allow Skig to produce it. After 20-30 tense minutes, they return*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have "taken our best shot" as the humans say<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Skig, prepare to power the warp bubble. Malat, on Skig's orders<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes captain.<br />

*Skig completes the calculations and adjusts the modulation of the warp field to account for the gravitic effect of the black hole and the event horizon, feeds that into the systems and activates the warp field as Malat puts "pedal to the metal".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Math saves the day again! Remember kids, you too could need big data one day!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Warp bubble is stable, I can't engage warp engines while in this configuration, but impulse control is back now<br />
