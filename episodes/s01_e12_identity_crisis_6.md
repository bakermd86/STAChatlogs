>First Officer's log, Stardate 61799.2: If we can't get out of here soon, this away mission may have no survivors. Voth scales are (apparently) incredibly itchy, and I am not sure how much more of this body I can take before I completely lose it.

>In the meantime, Skig insists that she has to remain slightly buzzed at all times in order to keep Murry's body functioning, even though that sounds absurd on its face. Regardless, she has gotten paranoid about running out of Romulan ale.

>And as if that wasn't bad enough:

>Viraseti has modified a laser welding drone into a hair removal robot to trim Skig's beard as it grows in real-time, which seems highly dangerous; 
> Murry is... well, let's call that one a private problem;
> And Zox somehow lost Viraseti's uniform pants;

>Honestly I have no idea how he did that, this is a small ship. It is truly a fool's errand to try to keep that man fully dressed for an entire mission.

>In summary: situation normal.<br />

>INTERIOR - Romulan Research Vessel: Lt. Commander Viraseti and Dr. V'Lora are hard at work programming their course into the makeshift navigation system that Zox and Skig rigged up. Commander Bachar has pulled Zox, Skig and Murry into a quiet corner to discuss their plans after they intercept the Lister.<br />

*Zox Sneezes while attempting to wootle the wootle of happiness at solving the Math Puzzle(TM).*<br />
*Zox begins gnawing at anything green.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Alright, Viraseti tells me she and Dr. V'lora will be ready to execute this insane plan in half an hour<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Alright, Viraseti tells me she and Dr. V'lora will be ready to execute this insane plan in half an hour<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Any suggestions on what we are planning to do when we intercept the Lister?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I suggest we ask the nice Romulans to stay cloaked and perform Orient, Observe, Decide, Action loops. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If only this were a warship with a cloaking device<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Good news, I have figured out how to adjust the Romulan replicators to generate a high enough grade of fermented soybeans that each of these 100g bars contains seven times the legal maximum of alcohol found in Romulan Ale. I can finally get this annoying buzz out of my head AND stop the hand shaking.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Skig, if you poison my body to death while you're inside of it, nobody will be left to care for the Lister<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Fermented? Oh wow. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Zerra can clone you a new liver when we get back<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** The hand shaking is entirely psychosomatic, and the buzz is tinitus<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Assuming we get back<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well, we still do not know how to unscromble our neural engrams. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And for that matter, there is no gaurantee that the Lister will even respond to our hails. We don't know why they abandoned us in the first place<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** The easiest way to unscramble them would just be using the Lister's teleporters, so hopefully this can solve itself when we reunite<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I assume that T'Kor and Gra'lan will have dissected the transporter room by now and have a good situation report of what happened and a remedy.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Honestly, I'm mostly worried about the fact that the more times Tellerite hair is cut, the faster and thicker it grows.<br />
>Suddenly, Subcommander Tekal pokes his head through the door<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I had not shaved in 15 years...<br />
*Subcommander Tekal looks at the hair on Murry's head*<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Yes, your hair seems quite long<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** You all may want to come to the bridge, we have something of a situation<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It grows due to the consumption of fermented beverages.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Please stop making things up about human biology<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yes subcommander, let's see what is going on.<br />
*Hailey Murry ignores fake Bachar and heads to the bridge.*<br />
*Subcommander Tekal pulls up a sensor display showing a vessel several light years away on an intercept course*<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** We detected them a few minutes ago, the warp signature suggests a B'Rel class Bird of Prey<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** How long until they reach us?<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Perhaps 10 minutes<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Possibly less, if they accelerate <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We should leave in about 8.5 minutes then.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** In this universe, are the Klingons sophisticated masters of poetry and culture, and settle disputes with complicated and lengthy debates?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps they just want verbal jousting and to learn the wisdom of our ways?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Records indicate they are brutal slavemasters who formed an alliance with the Cardassians to conquer the Terran Empire<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Dang. <br />
**Skig: [ REA(10) + SCI (5)]

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We're not ready to go over here yet, we're going to need at least 25 minutes before we execute or there's no telling where we end up<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Suggestions<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We need to buy her some time<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Launch a drone with our signature at Warp 5 in an oblique direction, then cloak and rig for silent running by powering down everything except the bare minimums.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We don't have a cloak, do we?<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** Correct, this is a research vessel<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay... skip the cloak, drop the Z-plane by 20km, and rig for no signature emissions.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** If they find us, we have to pretend to be locals<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Do we have any shelter nearby?<br />
**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti: Zox has used a point of Determination to add a natural one to the dice pool.**<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok, good thinking Zox<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Im loving our non-Euclidean friends more and more!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Get set up with your 4D trap, when the Klingons arrive: how do we get them to stop long enough for you to fire the deflector at them?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If they cloak and just start making attack runs, they could cripple us before we can even turn the deflector on<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** We're pretty clearly crippled, they're most likely going to reach out diplomatically first to see if we're an ally in need of help or an enemy<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I don't share your optimism, having read prior mission reports from this universe<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree! I believe an earth species of bird uses a 'broken wing display' to decieve its enemies. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They want to gloat about their superior ability to dispense violence at a galactic scale!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, our wings are pretty comprehensively broken<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Perhaps we could offer them the replicator recipe for these delicious 100g fermented soy bars?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** ...I don't think Klingon and Soy go together...in any universe...<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Even in the mirror universe, the Klingons like a good drink.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Of course they do, after all, SOYlent green is made of humans.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** WHAT?! It's made of humans?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Only if you get it from Throk<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti is now scared of eating processed green things.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** He was told to stop that<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Whatever, distract them as you will, they'll never see this coming!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok Skig, I guess we're going with your plan to confuse and or distract them with officers of fermented soy bars<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: offers*</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** No problem, I'll just adjust this to "beefy mega chewy raw flesh" flavor.<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Awesome... a pair of 19s! It cannot be bad.</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's too bad you're not klingon, you might be able to give them a bit more pause than a Human female trying to sell them soy bars<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Did someone mention grass-fed Targ?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Oh right, back to 4D weaponry...<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** How much time is this thing going to buy us?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Parley badly for 3 mins<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That's your stretch goal.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Just hit them as soon as you can<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Is that an order?<br />
**Subcommander Tekal:** The Klingon vessel has cloaked<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If you need it to be<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ok Skig, hail the klingons and see what you can do<br />
*Zox looks at the console where Zox and Murry are working*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We don't need you to buy much time, just get them to uncloak<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Murry and Zox should be able to hit them as soon as we can see them<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Wait... you are asking the autistic, unlikable Tellerite to handle negotiations?</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): This can't end badly...</font><br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hello there, we know you are out there. We are but a simple merchants looking to offer you some fine and exciting new culinary delights!<br />
**Klingon Captain:** Our sensors indicate no cargo bays on your vessel<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And you are so right! Because we are a research vessel looking into new and exciting culinary ventues!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Could I interest you in some delicious highly fermented beef sticks made from 100% authentic humans?<br />

**Klingon Captain:** You eat humans?<br />
**Klingon Captain:** How do they taste?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Kind of like Porg, but you really need to check the quality. You don't want the super flabby ones or they roast very poorly and are best used in our line of stew bases.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What I'm offering you is some more prime and free-range humans.<br />
**Klingon Captain:** Hmm, I will try this human meat for myself. Lower your shields and prepare to be boarded<br />
>As the Klingon ship drops its cloak, Zox activates the deflector array. The crew sits in silent anticipation, watching the viewscreen as nothing happens for a few long moments<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Uh.....<br />
>Just as it starts to seem like the plan isn't working, several small shapes appear near the Klingons, and moments later the ship is flung violently through space and vanishes from the sensors<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Wow, I genuinely can't believe that worked<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Please do not tell Rhuk about this. This was a very cowardly way of not smashing cranial plates.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** That is going to lead to some very confused reporting later<br />

>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Throk carries Kolea through the doors of Sickbay and sets her in a medbed near the Captain. As she begins to assess the damage to her body from the chemical weapon attack, a security guard brings Dr. Zerra through the sickbay doors at gunpoint<br />

**Throk:** Throk should eat your arms right now, Dr Zerra. If that is your real name<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra ** *(Laconic)*: It's not.<br />
**Redshirt:** I found him on Deck 8<br />
**Redshirt:** I decided to bring him here to check with the captain what he wants to do<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** When Kepeka jumped on the Dr, the transporter cross spliced the signals.<br />
**Kolea:** Really?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What does that mean?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Why are you referring to yourself in the third person?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It means I am Krepeka and the Dr is in my jello body.<br />
*Kolea looks at the display on the medical scanner which is providing her with a prognosis of her condition.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What? How would that be possible?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** That isn't how transporters work<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Yes, but there was that irregularity which you sent the technical team to resolve.<br />
**Throk:** Hmmm. Throk think you should tell us something only Lt Krepeka would know. <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Surely a wiley antagonist would use many escapes<br />
**Kolea:** Well, if you are Krepeka, what is the cross paralllel diagnostic transit value for a Breen when compared to 8 molar plastogenic transverse acids?<br />
*Kolea begins pushing buttons on her medical tablet.*<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It's true, I am, or was made of Ecto-Cooler.<br />
**Kolea:** What is Viraseti's favorite color of underwear?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Lavender.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): Great... now we need a random dice roll to see if that is right entirely by accident.</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Kolea, you are smarter than this. Running a neural net engram scan will show discordant encoding due to a fluid being transmigrated into a solid body. <br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Just as an engineer might find it impossible to bend a square into a circle, it is impossible to perfectly translate an engram stored in fluid physiology to a solid.<br />
**Kolea:** Sure, but I could also know that Viraseti's favorite color of underwear is black AND the real Dr. Zerra would not only know that, but likely would have reacted entirely different to that question.<br />
*Kolea hides the neural net engram scan results from the medical scanner screen.*<br />
