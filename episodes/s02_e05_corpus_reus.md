>Captains Log, Stardate 62133.7: Our resupply mission to Lasos III was uneventful, but before we set course for the stellar survey in the Omanite Reach, Lt. Commander Malat has asked me to assemble the senior staff for a briefing. She was a little vague as to why.<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: The senior staff assembles around the briefing table as Malat nervously checks the contents of a PADD.<br />

*Hailey Murry leans over to see if she can catch a glimpse*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Surely, no challenge should intimidate our intrepid and youthful Lt. Cmdr? What could be so concerning?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well if you'll recall, a few weeks ago we identified the warp signature of the vessel we encountered around the black hole where we rescued those Jem'Hadar fighters<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Since then, I developed and have been running a tracking program on the Lister's computer core. Using warp monitoring and surveillance data from listening posts along the border region, I am using a interferometric algorithm to reconstruct the path of that warp signature from the background warp field fluctuations<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Good work<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The computer's ETA for the program completing indicated it should have been done right around now, but the progress bar has stalled at 99%<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I hate when that happens<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Skig, permission to go kick the computer core<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I don't really think that would help, I don't think the computer core will respond to violence or threats of violence. Normally computers pretty much just do what they are programmed to do, and at most you can break them with external force. It's probably not going to make it go any faster<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** There are a few aspects of the Lister that I think do work better with percussive maintenance, but our computer core is not one of them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I suggest consulting with Gralan to learn the correct form of violence, and how best to apply it. <br />
>Suddenly, Malat's PADD chimes and she quickly taps a few controls to pull up a map of the sector on the monitor.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Finally, let's see what we've got on the CDS Roral....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Finally, let's see what we've got on the CDS Roral....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Permission to kick the computer core denied. Just defer the update until after your process completed. I set the update for Life Support systems to be Nice -15 instead of Nice 19, I guess this was needed so the filtering system stopped caused Decks 12-16 to smell like rotting vegetation.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Life Support updates are important, and I have been neglecting them for a while, but I somewhat realized that maybe that is not in the best interest of the crew.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Oh, which reminds me, AOL is turning off their dial-up service, so I need to have Gra'lan take care of the redshirts quarters if they are going to try and stream videos again.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Malat this is a wonderful piece of news and excellent research you have brought us. I would expect nothing less from a Star Fleet officer with a chance to redo her last 20 years of service.<br />
*Skig is still trying to figure out this "leadership" thing.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Best deduction I have ever seen. A shame I can't tell the difference between the red and green lines. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I think Starfleet grey market procurement gets all the abestos insulation needed for the Lister's hangar bay from Koralis. We could probably use that as an excuse to visit there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** But do we want to visit Koralis or snoop the Nebula?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Which reminds me, I need to see if T'kor remembered NOT to assign a group of Redshirts to strip the abestos off the cooling pipes without PPE. I keep people told that is bad.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Err.. people keep telling me that is bad.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** The McAllister nebula is 150 light years across, and the ionic interference will limit sensor range. If you want to investigate it, you're going to need a pretty good idea of where to go<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The problem with a nebula would be... we are searching for a needle in a proverbial haystack.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Or, more specifically, what Viraseti said.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Great minds think alike ma'am<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Great minds think alike ma'am<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Is this an ongoing scan? Will we know if they head back toward that nebula?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Right, but we won't get much out of Koralis - such a hub of trade isn't going to have to observe, with all the hussle and bussle day by day<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I can leave the progam running, but it is based on weekly sensor reports from the Starfleet Intelligence<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** So it won't be up-to-the-minute<br />
*Ensign Ghex raises her hand*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Ghex?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well, um... I hope I'm not interrupting, but you know whether we wanted to check out the nebula or the Koralis system we just need to make sure we have a way to isolate and track the ion trail or residual warp signature of the Roral. When I was at the academy, I got full marks on long-term starship tracking operations when we practiced ion trail tracking and warp field reconstruction in the Proxima Centauri system. My instructor said I was a natural.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Fantastic! What would you need to get that sort of read?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** How long has it been since the last time the Roral was in the nebula? If we are looking at an ion trail that is 30 days old in a shifting nebula field, that might make it a little more challenging than the well-charted Proxima Centauri system.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Looks like they were last in the nebula around 8 weeks ago, last time they were in Koralis was 2 weeks ago<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Despite Ensign Ghex's enthusiasm, I agree that tracking an 8-week old ion trail in a nebula would be a challenge. Koralis would certainly be easier.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** You brought Borg parts on board?!?!?! Do you have any idea how dangerous that is?!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yep.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** And you didn't think you should tell me?<br />

*Skig covers Ghex's eyes with her hand.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Skig, find a way to secure that thing safely. And if it can't be safely secured, then put it into an empty photon torpedo casing and fire it into a star<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I wonder if the McAllister Nebula is where they're storing their little secret fleet of Jem Hadar ships?<br />

*Hailey Murry would tell Ghex that she doesn't have to raise her hand, but given how much she talks that might actually be an issue. *<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, isn't the McAllister nebula deep inside Cardassian space? I am not an expert, but wouldn't it be like... super illegal for us to go there? And wouldn't the Cardassians shoot us? I've never been deep into Cardassian space before, we didn't cover unauthorized incursions into the sovereign territory of hostile alien powers at the academy, but it seems like it would be dangerous and possibly get us all court martialed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** True<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** We've violated Cardassian space like... four times in the past 2 years<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** If they do, it would be highly illegal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The armistice agreement stricly forbids sale of any salvaged Dominion material, it is all supposed to be returned to the Gamma quadrant. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Windbloom, do you know and merchants of ill-repute that would be willing to sell a little info?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** They have a thriving salvage and black market environment. The very environmentally unfriendly parts of the Lister get refits from there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I know some merchants who would be silling to sell us a little weed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I have never tried to buy info before<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** But I can ask<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** For instance, the nuclear fission standby reactor from the Russian Tuplelov class submarine that is in Old Faithless requires U-238.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Which reminds me, when we are there I need a cross-torx mylar coated tympanic hammer.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Oh, and 400 gallons of raw petroleum.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Can such an archaic reactor actually put out enough power for a shuttle, or is it just for radio and life support?<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Why do you need so much patroleum? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I'm pretty sure it's just there to fatally irradiate anyone that rides in the damn thing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Umm...a better question might be, why do we need it in an archaic non-metric unit?<br />
*Windbloom Openheart steps out of the briefing room for a few minutes before returning.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm pretty certain that reactor is capable of reaching sub jigawatts at 110% capacity, which should be more than enough to get it out any atmosphere that has an escape velocity of 11m/s.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I mean, no one will have hair and likely have bulbous tumours, but the ship will survive.<br />
*Skig thinks for a second.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Do we have a chance of developing super strength or x-ray vision?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm...I think this explains a couple things in engineering I need to look into.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Umm... oh absolutely.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** You might even develop ninja skills and a half-shell, plus an urge to eat pizza regularly based on the last time we tested the reactor on a redshirt.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Ok, I talked to my guy. Told him I needed to find a place that has some salvaged Jem'Hadar ships so I can find some KW tubes. He told me that there's a junkyard in Koralis called "Crazy Kolaakor's" that was rumored to have some dominion war salvage <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It may be better to avoid that for now, but we cana put that as plan B<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, just for the record I would vote that we should not be irradiated<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** That fills me with confidence, Windbloom<br />

>INTERIOR - Crazy Kolaakor's Salvage: The away team beams over to the office of Crazy Kolaakor's. The room is full of a chaotic mess of components and tools, stacked floor to ceiling. In the corner, an aquatic-looking alien is cleaning a pile of old Klingon disruptor rifles while listening to some kind of music which sounds like a dying whale to your ears.<br />

>INTERIOR - Kolaakor's Office: Kolea fumbles blindly through the thick gray clouds of gas and smoke now filling the junk dealer's front office. Loose junk clatters loudly to the deck as her hands clumsily reach for anything she can use to orient herself in the maze of old ship parts. She fights to keep her eyes open despite both the burning pain of the chemical irritants, and the effect of the sedatives she now clearly feels.<br />

>Before she can find her way out, she falls to the deck. The next thing she knows, Nurse Krepeka and Lt. Commander Viraseti are trying to help her to her feet, as her legs refuse to cooperate and stay underneath her. She looks around to see an away team from the Lister, who came in response to her distress call.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** That was unfortunate.<br />

It seems like this ship is always being infiltrated by spys and bad guys of some kind, huh? I am not an expert, I never took counter-intelligence at the academy, but it really seems like maybe there is a broader structural failing in the security aparatus on board the ship. I mean, at the Academy they talk a lot about how starship crews are like a family and the trust and collaboration required for a Starfleet vessel to operate smoothly. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Anyways, I reviewed the footage but it doesn't seem like there is anyone unexpected in that area. We don't have direct camera coverage of that hatch itself, but in all of the footage from the surrounding areas I only see medical personel like Kolea and Krepeka, which you would kind of expect since it is right next to main sickbay.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** No recent ion signatures or warp signatures in the area, apart from our own. <br />

>INTERIOR - Cardassian Medical Ship: T'Kor stares at the room full of Cardiassians in medical stasis tubes, unsure whether they would be considered legal salvage. Down the hall, Skig ponders the forcefield blocking her path as she follows the path of the ODN line that T'Kor severed. Meanwhile, a few meters away Tal'oran realizes that she is beginning to "trip balls" as the unknown substance that Windbloom gave her begins to take effect.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I think we should take them and their occupants back to the Lister, it is a somewhat grey area given jurisdiction and circumstances, but whoever they are might have useful information.

>INTERIOR - Sickbay: Kolea rushes from her office to the medical beds as Zox and Geret rush Krepeka's body back into sickbay from outside. As she is placed onto the bed, the automated systems begin to immediately chime with alerts regarding her various life-threatening conditions, while her head begins to melt.<br />

>As Kolea pulls up the neuroimager, she sees numerous potentially lethal brain injuries already propogating through Krepeka's neuro-fludic matrix. Her Temporal Lobe is dangerously hot, and if not dealt with could cause permanent memory loss or loss of speech. An aneurysm is developing in the prefrontal lobe which could burst, leading to death. The anterior fluidic cortex has gone toxic and is poisoning surrounding healthy brain tissue, it could make the issue much worse if not dealt with. And the pituitary valves are ruptured, leaking nervous system fluid all over the brain./save<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Okay, we have duct taped the collection of cryo tubes into a hexagonal pattern with cross-swapped polarity cores to avoid shorting anything out, then feeding it through the side port auxiliary generator and using the gerster feeds to increase the gravitational mass constant to keep them in place.<br />

So, I was up here on duty just running a navigational sensor calibration, and as you know that requires taking a continuous reference scan of a source of known luminosity in the subspace band. So I was using a nearby planetary nebula that was emitting a nice constant signal, but then the weirdest thing happened and all of a sudden there was a weird fluctuation in the signal modulation<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I thought it was probably interstellar dust, but I filtered for that and the modulation was still there, so I took a reading with the main long-range sensor array to get a spectrum so I could apply a high-pass filter<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: The senior staff converge on the briefing room under the faint blue glow of the emergency lighting. As they arrive, they enter to find Ensign Ghex lighting candles and placing them on the briefing room table.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** What's with the candles?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh, you know I figured since it was kind of dark with the emergency lighting and we need to keep power usage to a minimum to avoid giving away our position to the Roral, the candles seemed like a nice way to brighten up the room a little bit.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We still have men on the station, don't we?<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Malat wordlessly flicks on a standard issue flashlight and pulls the jacket forward to convert it to lantern mode.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, I left a security team behind<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** This is amazing planning Ghex. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** So we need to create a diversion before we can pick up our crew and warp out.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Or we can just hide and hope they don't notice us, I powered everything down and used the maneuvering thrusters to match the drift of the surrounding junk vessels. The Lister is pretty old, so we kind of also look like space junk. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Umm....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** But we still have the crew on the station, they'll certainly go there<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, I don't think hiding is going to work long term, once they figure out that we were on that medical ship they're going to search the yard<br />
*Skig contemplates spacing Ghex, but realizes that would probably get Bachar mad at her.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** And we still have a few of them frozen....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yerp.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Either our saboteur onboard or the broken ODN line will have tipped them off that someone has been nosing around, and that someone was unlikely to escape.

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I'm inclined to agree, Ghex may have bought us a little time but we shouldn't get comfortable here<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** They're probably the ones who set up all the mines over there as well<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm surprised they were able to get here so quickly<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** What direction did they appear from?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well... so ma'am, the thing is, I originally thought that the signal from the Roral was just interference. So I was actually trying to apply a high pass filter to the navigational sensors to filter it out, rather than get a precise bearing. Which is to say, that I um... didn't really take a bearing on it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** You are sure its the Roral, though? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh yeah, it exactly matches the warp signature that Lt. Commander Viraseti reconstructed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** What if we magnitize their hull and turn all the garbage into a weapon? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We could use the maneuvering thrusters to point us at a clear path from the debris field, use the particle injection matrix to immediately jump to warp after we remove the safety overrides from the ship and then kick us into warp 7. Of course, there is a reason Starfleet has removed that option from every other ship in the fleet. Something about fusing all organic matter into the bulkheads.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well, that would certainly distract them for a bit. I'm not sure how we would magnetize their hull though.<br />
*Skig reconsiders now that she is First Officer.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Given the mines they have scattered throughout, it'd probably do more than distract<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Wow, so uhm.. Well the first officer's plan is interesting, but I think that it would reduce the crew to a uniform homogenate.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Actually, let's not do my idea until we run out of others.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes Ghex, there is a chance we would all turn into sentient doors.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Geret already does that frequently enough<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** They realistically do not know what ship is here. We could launch a shuttlecraft and have it distract the Roral away from the Lister.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Did anyone spot any ships that would be a good contender? If we find a good one, we could lure the Roral close to one of the mines like that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** A good EVA spacewalk! Just what we needed!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Kal'aakor's station is still powered up.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yes Ma'am!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We need to pick up the people over there anyway, we don't we just activate his sensors/scanning/defense grid and pick the Roral as the target for "failure to pay"?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** These are anti-ship mines, so your EVA suits will be too small to set off their proximity sensors. But if you accidentally set one off, you'll all be instantly vaporized<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** There's no reason we can't do both. Zox can lead the team to reprogram the mines, Skig and I can head over to the station<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Hit them from both sides<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Probably don't be near the mines when we set things off, though<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I also wouldn't want to be on the station when it opens fire, the Roral will shred that place in a matter of seconds once it responds<br />

>INTERIOR - Kolaakor's Station - A Cardassian combot unleashes a deadly volley of disruptor fire against the exterior hull in order to fulfil its ecological conservation directive. Malat and Tal'Oran both start to get blown out into space and reach for their helmets. Skig is far enough that she just feels a strong wind as the air in the station begins to rapidly evactuate.<br />

>As the air rushes out, the various piles of loose junk scattered around the station begin to take flight, debris and garbage are flying through the air, battering anything that happens to get in their path on the way to the massive hull breach.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I feel like you're not listening: I want no part of this. Not to mention that drugging someone against their will is a total violation of my oath as a physican.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** Well then you're perfect for the job, you're an expert at violating your oath as a physician. You're to report for duty tomorrow at 08:30, unless you would prefer that I write a memo on the topic of your oath as a physician for Admiral Nechayev.<br />
>Haggarty stands up and takes Dr. Zerra's tea from the table as he walks out.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/LtHaggarty.png" alt="Lt. Haggarty" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Haggarty** Thanks for the tea. Don't be late.<br />
>Dr. Zerra is left sitting alone holding the PADD detailing his assignment, against his will, as the Lister CMO as the memory fades.<br />

>61228.4<br />

>Dr. Zerra is sitting in his office in sickbay, on his screen he has a genetic scan of Zox showing mild genetic damage from the snake creature on Malari. He pulls up Zox's last physical to compare the DNA from that scan, and calculates approximately a 0.1% genetic degredation.<br />

>He opens Zox's chart and begins to write an entry with a recommended treatment plan of 40mg of Trimazepiroline every 8 hours for 2-4 weeks. Then he pauses, looks out through the windows of his office and sees Kolea busy taking Zox's vitals and updating his chart.<br />

>He sighs and deletes the update he was working on, then pulls up Zox's DNA scan and begins to modify large swaths of the bases in the scan using the DNA scan from the alien creature. Within a few moments, he has a DNA sequence that is so badly damaged it would be impossible to treat without a genetic donor. He saves the modified scan, overwriting the original, then closes the file and opens the comms.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Captain, I have completed analyzing treatment options for Commander Zox. I think you had better come down to sickbay to discuss.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Baras.png" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras** Oh that sounds serious, I'm on my way Doctor.<br />
>Dr. Zerra closes the comms, and re-opens Zox's chart. He adds an update to the treatment plan: "Genetic damage too severe to repair pharmacologically. Live donor is required for genetic graft treatment. Patient's mother lives within range, will recommend this treatment plan to the patient and the captain."<br />

>Dr. Zerra closes the file and angrily throws the PADD onto the work bench behind his desk. He gets up and walks over to the closet to put on his clinical coat before leaving his office. He grabs the coat and pauses for several long moments, looking at himself on the mirror on the inside of the closet. He sighs again, then puts on the labcoat and walks out of his office as the memory fades.<br />

>61418.9<br />

>Dr. Zerra is standing in front of the replicator in his quarters. He is out of uniform, wearing a nice dress shirt and slacks over his anti-gravity exosuit. He has a recipe open in the programming interface for a recipe that seems to be made of some kind of large bird. He is repeatedly tapping his foot up and down as he make small tweaks to the program.<br />

>Just then, he hears the door chime and he hits the replicate button just before turning to head for the door. He walks past the table, set with two plates and a bottle of Earth wine, and opens the door. Lt. Commander Viraseti is standing outside in the hall holding a PADD.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Doctor, I was reviewing the brain scans from Commander Murry's recent troubles with the cosmic string. I was seeing some unusual results that I wanted to run past you.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Oh, of course. Come in, we can have a look at what you're seeing. The neurological scans have a lot of interference from the string, so we might need to clean them up a little bit.<br />
>Viraseti comes in through door as Dr. Zerra is speaking, when the door closes behind her they stop talking for a moment before breaking out in laughter.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I feel like we need some more believable excuses if we're going to keep our little secret, I think Lieutenant Ciobanu is already getting suspicious.<br />
>Viraseti takes off her uniform jacket to reveal a low cut blouse that she had been concealing underneath in place of the standard uniform top.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Well she does live across the hall... We don't strictly need to keep it a secret though, I outrank you but I'm not a part of your chain of command so it doesn't violate regulations. But anyways, I wanted to show you this: I made an Elaysian specialty for tonight: Rampak. It's a bird native to Elaysia, they're born flying and never touch the ground in their entire lives.<br />
>Viraseti lets down her hair and then turns and puts her arms around Zerra's waist.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** That's a fascinating anecdote Koron, but we absolutely need to keep this secret. Also let's roll that back just for a moment: what do you mean you outrank me? Last I checked, your rank is also Lt. Commander.<br />
>Viraseti cracks a wry smile.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** True, but as Chief Medical Officer I have the authority to issue orders to any member of the senior staff, as medically necessary.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Oh, is that so? Well what medical necessities were you planning to order me to do?<br />
>Dr. Zerra blushes and stammers.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Well, I.. I hadn't really thought that far ahead. I thought we'd start with dinner and just see...<br />
>Viraseti interrupts him.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Relax, but we are going to have to work on your flirting "Lt. Commander"<br />
>Viraseti smiles and lets go of his waist, sits down at the table and opens the wine. She pours it into the glasses and hands one to Dr. Zerra as he sets the roast on the table.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Elaysian women aren't as.. forceful as you, I suppose.<br />
>Dr. Zerra begins to take a sip of the wine as he takes his seat across from Viraseti.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Oh if you think that's forceful, you're in for a big shock later.<br />
>Dr. Zerra spit takes and begins to choke on his wine, Viraseti howls in laughter and Zerra can't help but laugh as well as the memory fades.<br />

>61688.4<br />

>Dr. Zerra waves goodbye to a patient as they leave Sickbay, then walks back over to his office. He closes the patient's chart and enters in a combination of keys on the keypad. An unlabeled program pops up and is displaying a connectivity error.<br />

*Zox is confused by the bizzare mammal mating ritual*<br />
>He tries a few controls but the connectivity error remains. He frowns for a few moments while tapping his fingers on the desk.<br />

>He opens a control within the program that has playback buttons and holds down the rewind control. After a few moments, a rapidly reversing feed of the inside of a Zeppalite transport with Kolea, Haily Murry and the Twins in it begins to flash past. He stops the rewind and plays the feed fowards.<br />

>Look at this baroque styling, ample head-room, attention to detail. Federation ships just lose it all on smoothness and faux-modern art style.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Look at this baroque styling, ample head-room, attention to detail. Federation ships just lose it all on smoothness and faux-modern art style.<br />
>Zox's voice can be heard, but he is not visible in the feed.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10** We would not advise repeating that around Commander Skig<br />
>Kolea, Murry and the Twins all turn and look at the "camera"<br />

>The twins and Kolea both pull out tricorders and begin to run a scan. Kolea makes a puzzled face while the Twins regard the tricorder screen dispassionately.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** What’s wrong? Am I not mighty?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** You don’t appear to be seriously injured, my Tricoder is having trouble identifying you.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Twins.png" alt="Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10** Curious… Stand by....<br />
>The Twins turn back to the ops console and tap out several commands. As they do so, the feed cuts out.<br />

>Dr. Zerra rolls the feed back again and plays it foward in slow motion, zooming in on the console as the Twins turn to interract with it.<br />

>In the slow motion feed, he can see the Twins access the comms system and program a jamming signal. As he realizes this, he goes pale and immediately runs to the closet and starts shoving things into a bag. A few moments later, he stops and just stands there staring into the mirror. He jams the half packed bag back into the locker and walks out of sickbay, still pale in the face, as the memory fades.<br />

>61835.4<br />

>Dr. Zerra (in Neraran's body) is sitting at the console of a type 7 shuttle reading a Regalian novel on a PADD. He looks up from the PADD and turns the navigation display on. It is showing a 13 hour ETA on the trip. As he flips off the navigation console, he sees the reflection of Neraran's face in the black glass panel, and turns away in disgust.<br />

>Alone in the shuttle, he stares out the window into the void and screams at the top of his lungs. He collapses to the deck and curls up into the fetal position, laying motionless for several more minutes before the memory fades.<br />

>49941.8<br />

>Dr. Zerra is hunched over a medical book in his apartment on Earth. Out the window, you can see the skyline of Sao Paolo lit up the darkness. He is so focused on his studies, he doesn't hear the door chime. It rings again, and a third time.<br />

>Dr. Zerra still does not look up. A few moments later, the door swishes open and a similar looking Elaysian man walks in through the door with his hands behind his back.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ZerraBrother.png" alt="Linis Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Linis Zerra** You know, one of these days your neighbors are going to report me to the security service if you keep making me break in.<br />
>Dr. Zerra finally looks up from his books and turns to see his brother.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Well you wouldn't have to break in if you just rang the door like a normal person Linis.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ZerraBrother.png" alt="Linis Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Linis Zerra** I'll take that under advisement.<br />
>Linis grins for a moment before his smile fades, a somber expression creeps across his face.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ZerraBrother.png" alt="Linis Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Linis Zerra** I just found out, and I wanted to let you know...<br />
>Dr. Zerra looks worried, he closes his book and rises from his desk.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ZerraBrother.png" alt="Linis Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Linis Zerra** I got the posting. You're looking at the new second shift Tactical Officer of the USS Odyssey!<br />
>Linis produces two bottles of Elaysian Cloud Wine from behind his back, then pops both corks triumphantly. Dr. Zerra howls and grabs a bottle, the brothers and toast and begin singing an Elaysian ballad as the memory fades.<br />

>51816.4<br />

>Dr. Zerra is standing on his balcony as the sun rises over Sao Paolo. A light rain is blowing in from the coast, and he closes his eyes as the water droplets splash against his face.<br />

>He looks down and sees blood pooling beneath his bare feet, amongst the shards of glass from the shattered bottle of Tarqalian whiskey.<br />

>He pours the rest of the whiksey from his glass onto his bloodied foot, and winces in pain as the alcohol burns in the open wounds.<br />

>As he stands alone in silence, he is startled by a voice from behind<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Sloan.png" alt="Unknown Man" width="50" height="50">**Unknown Man** Very dramatic. I wish I had my holo-imager to adequately capture the moment.<br />
>Dr. Zerra turns around in shock, grabs the stem of the broken bottle, and brandishes it at the man.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Who are you?! How did you get in here!?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Sloan.png" alt="Unknown Man" width="50" height="50">**Unknown Man** Relax my good doctor, I mean you no harm. I'm just here as a concerned party, who would hate to see such a brilliant young mind waste away in this room when there is so much work to be done.<br />
>Dr. Zerra stares at the man in disbelief, still suspicious of this stranger who has broken into his home. The man walks over to the couch and sits down, shoving some unwashed laundry from the couch onto the floor.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Get the hell out of here before I call security.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Sloan.png" alt="Unknown Man" width="50" height="50">**Unknown Man** I don't think you're going to do that Doctor. Now if you think you can set aside your self pity for a moment, I can offer you the chance to make sure that what happened to your brother doesn't happen to any other Starfleet officers. Or anyone else for that matter. Alternately, you can just jump off that balcony and save us the trouble of watching you drink yourself to death.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** What... what are you talking about? Who are you?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Sloan.png" alt="Unknown Man" width="50" height="50">**Unknown Man** I'm no one of any great importance doctor. Nor are you, I'm afraid to say. But in light of... recent events, my organization is in need of medical expertise that you can provide. And together, those of us of little importance will do what is necessary to safeguard the Federation.<br />
>Dr. Zerra slowly lowers his broken bottle and walks inside to hear what the stranger on his couch has to say as the memory fades.<br />

>51941.8<br />

>Dr. Zerra is sitting in the passenger seat of a small atmospheric transport. A very familiar looking woman sits in the pilot's seat, as the transport flies up the coast of central America<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I don't remember the last time I actually flew in atmosphere. Why aren't we just using the transporter?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** This is Earth Doctor, transporter signals are constantly monitored and logged. And a nondescript transport leaves less of an obvious surveilance trail. Your new assignment at Starfleet Medical should go through soon enough, and after that you can come and go through the front door like everyone else.<br />
>Dr. Zerra chuckles briefly before the Trill shoots him a cold look.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I think you're being a little paranoid, the Federation isn't a surveillance state.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Don't be under illusions here: we're committing treason, among numerous other crimes. We will maintain absolutely secrecy on this project or I will bury you in your brother's empty casket.<br />
>Dr. Zerra clams up and turns back towards the window without responding. He watches as the transport flies directly towards the side of a building at Starfleet Medical. As it nears the building, the craft does not appear to be slowing sufficiently. Afraid to speak to the Trill beside him, he just glances nervously and grips the armrest.<br />

>Instead of a violent impact, the shuttle passes harmlessly into the side of the building to reveal a small landing pad hidden behind a holographic curtain. After setting down the transport, the Trill stands and opens the rear hatch.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Come on doctor, I won't be burying you today. I'll show you to your lab.<br />
>Dr. Zerra picks up his bag and follows the Trill out of the transport into the landing bay beyond.<br />

>54821.2<br />

>Dr. Zerra leans back from the microscope and rubs his eyes. He pulls the slide out and marks the batch number down in his research log: FAILED<br />

>Another doctor approaches from the open door and sees Dr. Zerra recording the failure. She sighs and hands him a PADD.<br />

**Female Doctor** Still no luck? We're having the same problem in the cellular degeneration lab. These Founders are harder to kill than cockroaches.<br />
>Dr. Zerra squints quizically and starts to open his mouth to speak before he is interrupted.<br />

**Female Doctor** Sorry, cockroaches are a bug found in some parts of Earth... It's not important. The point is: I'm just not sure this project is even going to be possible. This Founder morphogenic matrix has incredible cellular regeneration.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** You may be right, but I still a viral approach might work...<br />
>The other doctor interrupts Dr. Zerra with a chuckle<br />

**Female Doctor** Of course YOU think a viral approach will work, but its immune system is almost impossibly capable. We may have to accept that this just isn't possible.<br />
>As they speak, they hear a notification and turn to see the headline of a Federation news bulletin: Deep Space Nine Falls to the Domion.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Hopefully you're wrong, this war doesn't seem to be off to a great start for us.<br />
>Dr. Zerra turns back to his desk and buries his face in his hands as the memory fades.<br />

>56431.8<br />

>Dr Zerra is sitting at a table in the secret facility in Starfleet Medical with another doctor. They both have mugs in front of them. Outside the door, a few other doctors are rushing around packing up equipment.<br />

**Female Doctor** You have any big plans lined up after the winddown? Dr. Korok got the CMO posting on the USS Redoubt. He's going to be shipping out with the Fourth Fleet in a couple of weeks.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I don't want a starship posting, I think I prefer to practice medicine and do research here at Starfleet Medical. I did my rotations on a starbase and it's very... hectic. Always a new emergency, limited facilities for research, constant crew health evaluations...<br />
>Dr. Zerra trails off as he takes a sip of his tea.<br />

**Female Doctor** I can understand that, I served on a Starship once-upon-a-time, gave it up to teach. It suits me better, much more of an opportunity to listen to the sound of my own voice.<br />
>Dr. Zerra and the other doctor both crach a faint smile before it fades.<br />

**Female Doctor** I could talk to the head of Virology at the hospital. It's a teaching hospital obviously, so you would have to teach some classes as well. But you'd have plenty of time for research and you would be an attending.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Thanks Sarah, I would appreciate that. It is hard to know how to list this job on a posting application.<br />
**Female Doctor** Oh no, that's easy: "Top Secret Warcrime Research."<br />
