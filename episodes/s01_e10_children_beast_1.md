>Captains Log, Stardate 61686.5: Thankfully, our mysterious summons back to Sector 017 was for environmental protection, not another war. I am sure Commander Zox is dissapointed, but I am sure most of the crew is glad not to be dragged back into combat.

Hopefully the crew don't do anything to embarrass me again with the entire fleet gathered in one place. Admiral Ross didn't seem to think much of me during my command competency review... Here's hoping for a smooth week.<br />

*Skig will do everything she can so Captain Baras gets a good command competency review.*<br />
*Skig also wants to make sure the Lister performs superbly.*<br />

<font color="#005500">GM: And just for fun, the other 8 titles you could have had were: "From the Temple to the Tomb", "Leave your worry on the doorstep", "The devil deals the cards", "A walk-on part in the war", "Between the windows of the sea", "Facts learned from fools and from sages", "A cold lonely light that shines", "The wind in the wires"</font><br />
**Kolea:** Those all sound cool, honestly.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): need to figure out what your playlist is =D</font><br />
**Zox:  [d20 = 20]**<br />
>INTERIOR - Zeppalite transport: Murry and Zox's team are situated quite comfortably in a civilian transport for once, after Zox managed to secure something spacious and not-delapidated out of the Starfleet vessel impound lot. They are cruising along at warp 5, heading for the border of Breen space with their forged identity and passage documents.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, im so glad to be in this vintage ship. Really takes me back to good Voth ships.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Look at this baroque styling, ample head-room, attention to detail. Federation ships just lose it all on smoothness and faux-modern art style.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We would not advise repeating that around Commander Skig<br />

*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 take out a tricorder and begin scanning Zox*<br />
*Kolea takes out a medical tricoder and begins scanning Zox.*<br />
**Kolea:** It's probably a good idea to find out what is broken BEFORE it gets worse.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What's wrong? Am I not mighty?<br />
**Kolea:** You don't appear to be seriously injured, my Tricoder is having trouble identifying you.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Curious...<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Stand by<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 turn to a console and enter several commands rapidly*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Most strange, not many Voth joined the Federation.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I should stand out.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commander Skig asked for our assistance in troubleshooting a myserious source of intereference in her listening device built into your suit. <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It seems you have a pre-existing second listening device transmitting encrypted audio/visual data already<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have taken the liberty of jamming the signal for now, until we can determine a proper course of action<br />
**Kolea:** That is fascinating, I am more disturbed by the fact that your baseline "healthy" state involves four broken bones.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Eat Spinnach for healthy bones!<br />
**Kolea:** It looks like the Emergency Voth Distress System Dr. Zerra installed is currently being blocked by that jamming frequency.<br />
*Kolea grabs a chainsaw.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Woah, woah, save that for later =D<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps there are less invasive and dangerous methods to determine the source of the signal<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ooh this tingles!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Huh. It's not supposed to. <br />
>Kolea comprehensively survey's Zox's entire body, the only foreign device present is Dr. Zerra's medical implant. She is certain there is no other foreign body present<br />

*Kolea has her arm up to the shoulder in Zox's rectum.*<br />
**Kolea:** I can disable that.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Disable what?<br />
*Kolea shoves one of Zox's hearts aside and tickles his left kidney.*<br />
*Zox is uncomfortable.*<br />

**Kolea:** Zox, you have been eating too many berries again, I feel some cavities in your lower molars.<br />
*Kolea still has her arm in Zox's rectum up to the shoulder.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think... if we're doing something incognito, it would be a good idea to stop the feeds regardless, yes? <br />
**Kolea:** Probably.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You seem to know alot Kolea.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Of course, if the doctor's implant is streaming surveillance data, then he already knows where we are and what we are doing<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hm. True<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Or whoever the information is going to<br />
**Kolea:** I mean, realistically, we should probably come up with names, cover stories, and disguises because it is not like at least you and Zox aren't already well-known and blindingly obvious to our quarry.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, a question then. Shall we dramatically change plans? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's you. You are in charge here. =D<br />
**Kolea:** If this involves me getting to use a Disruptor Rifle on Jasanis, I'm not going to object.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** She gives green people a bad name!<br />
**Kolea:** Exactly!<br />
*Kolea takes arm out of Zox's rectum and takes off the large plastic tarp.*<br />
**Kolea:** I think you are probably doing fine in general.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Excellent! I was worried about all that cafeteria food.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If Dr. Zerra is spying for Commander Bachar, then surely she would have involved him in our data recovery mission<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We certainly could have used his help<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is possible that a third party is using his implant to spy on Zox<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well this is too spooky for me. Time to extract the implant and put it in stasis.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes that!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Zerra's innoculus implant may have been compromised.<br />
