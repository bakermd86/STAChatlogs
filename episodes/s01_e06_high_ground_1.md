>Captain's log, Stardate 61240.9: We have diverted from our diplomatic mission to Sulani IV at the request of Lt. Cmdr Viraseti. She asked me to call a briefing of the senior staff so she can explain what this is all about. She says it is urgent, so I have approved her request to divert even though I don't yet know what this is all about. I hope she isn't wasting my time, I would like to imagine a starfleet officer would never do that, but with this crew you can never be too sure...<br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing Room: Lt. Cmdr Viraseti connects her PADD to the briefing room monitor and pulls up a diagram view of a globular cluster at a fourier transform.<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Ever since our encounter with the Traveler from Tau Alpha C I have been working with colleagues at the Argus array to monitor for his unique warp signature.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have been researching the nature of his warp field manipulations, hoping it could be put to some good use. But a few hours ago we detected something very strange.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Always a good sign<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I detected a matching signature in a nearby globular cluster, but this one had a markedly different subspace spectrum. It looked like an attempt to replicate the sort of warp bubbles that the Traveler created using a conventional warp engine.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The cluster is less than 20 light years away from our course, so I asked the captain if we can divert to investigate. <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It shouldn't add much delay to our mission, and the potential scientific value is immense<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...So...either smugglers or an uncharted civilization wants to be as cool as the Traveler?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And it's pretty much guaranteed that whoever it is had access to information on the Traveler? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Possibly, I am hoping to get a better reading of the residual warp energy when we are closer to the signal<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Yes, that is a safe bet<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would recommend reconfiguring Modular Laboratory 4 next to the Port Sensor arrays to take better advantage of the warp bubble signatures. The starboard side array has been failing higher level diagnostics and keeps switching to a Klingon Opera Playlist.<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
*Zox acts innocent.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do we have any information on Starfleet operations in the area that might be engaged in some technical testing we might not be normally privvy to?<br />

*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 tap a few keys on their PADD*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's some keen thinking, but I can't recall any.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Starfleet records indicate no Starfleet vessel has been in this cluster since stardate 44300<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, do we have an approximate size of the warp bubbles and do they have subspace eddies that may interfere with our warp bubble within a certain range?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** One has to assume someone would want to use the Traveler's abilities for a military purpose.<br />
*Lt. Malat nods in agreement. *<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** History has conclusively proven that all inventions stem from military need or Rule 34.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** At our current range, I can't say much as to the topology of the warp bubble<br />
*Skig checks script to see if that is what her line was supposed to be. Decides later to to a web search on Rule 34 and figure out what that means.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have Ensign Ishemok monitoring as we approach<br />
*Skig runs a diagnostic to see if Ishemok is making off with any monitors in the modular laboratories.*<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Perhaps we should check in on him though, I don't know if he as access to heavy cutting equipment<br />
**Ishemok ** *(intercom)*: Esteemed officers of the Lister: I am recieving a strange communications signal on baroque radio frequencies, but require help decoding them, any volunteers? Perhaps some Bynars?<br />
*Skig flips up internal security cameras to show three of them focused on Ishemok at all times.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** He seems to have not stolen anything in the last...<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Patch it through to the briefing room Ensign, we'll have a look<br />
*Skig speeds checks recordings.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** 27 minutes.<br />
*Ishemok beep boop beep, patching...*<br />
>Ishemok pulls up a frequency analysis of a far-infrared radio signal he has been receiving from the same direction as Viraseti's warp bubble signal<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If the communications signal is not baroque, don't fix it.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If it's just stealing from the mess hall, it's not that big a deal, we all take extra cookies no?<br />
*Kurij waits by the dedicated console labeled "TIME SINCE ISHEMOK'S LAST THEFT", ready to hit the reset button*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No way it could be a comm signal, it's old-fashioned radio, light speed only<br />
*Skig makes a note to apply electro-shock lightning arcs to anyone who takes extra cookies from the food replicators.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Har har, Voth first rediscovered humans by picking decaying radio signals from Earth. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Radio was the original comm signal used by Earth and several other civilizations for quite some time.<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 17]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let me see if I can do a breakdown on the signal and pull it apart into its constituent pieces. There may be clues in there. <br />
*Skig evaluates the waveform to see if it is an analog or digital transmission, and the quality of it.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ishemok, can you determine if the signal is getting closer or further away based on shift?<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So it looks like this is the same general pattern as a Starfleet Comm signal, but we'd normally expect this to be in a subspace band. <br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe the traveler is trying to make some nascent civilization survive technological adolescence.<br />
**Kurij:** Stronger as in it's coming at us?<br />
>Skig routes the signal into the comms, a strange, periodic pop is heard from the speakers, but nothing else<br />

**Ishemok:** Yes!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, this is better than a diplomatic mission already!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Anything to get out of wearing a dress uniform<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think the dress uniform looks quite good on you, Lt Malat, it's a shame you don't get the opportunity to wear it more often<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nonsense Malat, the fluted skirt looks fine on you. At least you to do not have hairy tree trunk legs.<br />
*Lt. Malat looks visibly annoyed*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well we've been reading the signal continuously for the past 8 minutes<br />
*Skig checks to see if Malat has done anything worthy of being thrown in the brig to avoid having to wear her dress uniform. Cannot find anything specific, but decides to mention that option later when fewer people are around.*<br />
**Kurij:** How long since the faux Traveler signal? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And at our current warp factor, that means the signal has been transmitting continuously for several years at least<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And? Do they bring peace or war?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Because we have covered 3.6 light years since Ensign Ishemok first detected it<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If the signal is getting stronger, it is safe to posit they are being generated by the warp bubbles?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If it is a comms signal, then they certainly have a lot to say<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What if they are putting radio signals IN warp bubbles if they haven not yet discovered subspace? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Interesting hypothesis, an attempt to reproduce faster-than-light communications via radio signals in warp bubbles? It may be possible, but it seems much more difficult than ordinary subspace communication<br />

[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 27]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However, if the goal was to communicate with something inside the warp bubble that did not have access to modern communication equipment, that might be feasible. Remember that Murry said this was a Federation Comm signal.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It certainly seems like one, yes. What do the records say about the last vessel in this area? <br />
**Ishemok:** Negative Zox; this signal is information poor and is unlikely to be the transmission of a message.<br />

**Ishemok:** oh thank goodness. Thanks Ishemok.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** oh thank goodness. Thanks Ishemok.<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d20 = 11]**<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, the last trip here didn't actually fully survey the cluster. They detected "dangerous levels of spacial curvature" and left without risking anything.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oh shit, I should go turn off the autopilot and fly the ship then<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait, no there was another one. The USS...Crazy Horse was presumed lost here with all hands during the Dominion War. They were just on patrol and vanished in the system. <br />
*Lt. Malat darts back out to the bridge*<br />
**Kurij:** I'll provide assistance!<br />
*Kurij heads off after Lt Malat*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Spatial curvature is likely a result of warp bubbles and temporal distortion.<br />
*Zox lets out careful gazes across the briefing room while filing his talons.*<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Not necessarily, spatial curvature can be caused by any large gravity well<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Would the warp bubbles and temporal distortion have been something that the USS Baton Rouge would have mentioned during their survey, though? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It seems that perhaps it was more passive? And now is more active for some reason? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True, although the fact radio waves are escaping it reduces the risk of various spectral phenomena like interstital black holes and light absorbing gravity wells.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Well a radio signal could still originate near a black hole, it would just be red-shifted<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** So....there's an amateur HAM radio guy stuck on a vessel that just thinks it survived a Cardassian attack, and we are gonna rescue them just in the nick of time?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Active black holes emit significant x-ray  signals along the axes of their rotation<br />

Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 3]**<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti how much closer do we need to get before we drop to normal space and safely evaluate the signal and the warp bubbles?<br />
*Hailey Murry is ecstatic that she gets to use her acoustics knowledge*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So assuming that the original is a standard subspace signal, this infrared signal id redshifted by a factor of 2.7*10^-6<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Intersting assumption. We've recorded approximately 3.6 years worth of this signal, if you're right then that would equate to... around 40 seconds of subspace communications<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Then consolidate that down into a single compression and see if it plays back as something other than a "pop" sound.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I need to know! What does it say!<br />

>Skig ramps up the playback speed and the pops get more frequent, blur together into low frequency sounds, and then ramp up in frequency into a discernable voice<br />

**Captain Dowers:** Repeat: This is Captain William Dowers of the USS Crazy Horse, we are under attack by three Jem'Hadar fighters. We're trying to lose them in the...<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Huh. Do you think they lost them?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat (Over comms):** Senior staff to the bridge, there's something you should see<br />
*Zox reaches for a Luchadore mask on hearing Jem'Hadar, but then realizes the hopelessness of bridging the time/space gap to get to them.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or they are trapped in one of the warp bubbles and are still in the process of trying to evade them.<br />
*Skig heads to the bridge.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry ** *(to Malat via the Comm Badge)*: Malat, you should know that there may be three Jem'Hadar fighters that we have to worry about. It looks like the Crazy Horse fled into the system to lose them.<br />
*Hailey Murry heads to the bridge as well*<br />
>Malat pulls up an image on the viewscreen of the coordinates Viraseti provided<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Viraseti's signal came from in there<br />
>♫♫♫Ominous Music Sting♫♫♫<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, to be fair, the Jem'Hadar probably couldn't withstand a longer mission, or being trapped away from a source of Ketracel White. So if William tried to shake them, as long as enough relative time past, withdraw would save them from their immediate attackers.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I'm all for scientific curiousity, but we can't fly the Lister into a binary black hold system to investigate a curious warp signature<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...but don't we have a duty to try and fish out the Crazy Horse?<br />
**Kurij:** How do we fish them out when we have to enter the tar pit alongside them to get them out? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I agree with Zox, if there's a Starfleet ship trapped in there we have a duty to attempt a rescue<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** the 'how' becomes the responsiblity of the entire science team here on the Lister. =D<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We might be able to use those teleportation anomalies to get them out. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I agree with the Captain that if the risk to the Lister is too great, it is best observed from a distance and we should continue with our original mission.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Why am I not surprised<br />
**Kurij:** To be fair, it's actually a reasonable take this time<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Because you are an excellent planner?<br />
*Skig is oblivious to the fact that Bachar just insulted her.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** If we want to attempt a rescue of the Crazy Horse we're going to need a way to do it safely<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I have 11 grandchildren, I wasn't planning to outlive them<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Are we still picking up any of that Traveller signal? <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** So I'm not taking the Lister any closer to the black hole without some way to protect it from the effects of the gravity well<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Just reading the residual warp energy now, the signal seems to have been a short burst within the past day or so<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** localized to the area around the black hole accretion region<br />
*Zox taps his claws.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I sure hope no travelers come and give us sage advice.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Last time I tracked the Traveler's natural warp signature, he was in the Beta quadrant <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I wouldn't count on his help <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm. If light can't escape a black hole, can a ship travelling faster than light escpae it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Nominally we could use some sort of Inertial Dampener that would allow us to ride their gravometic waves as they pulse with a minimal risk to the ship at the expense of artificial time dilation resulting in an uneven passage of time between the Lister and normal space?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** ...how much dilation? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The inherent question of subspace and warp space coming in contact with the gravity well of a Black Hole could be catastrophic, which is why our alert systems like to tell us when we get dangerously close to them, per Starfleet SOP.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We're certainly not going to cross any event horizons today<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suspect Viraseti or someone more familiar with space-time dilation metrics could answer that, Counselor.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** And I want a way to avoid any time dilation before I approve any attempted rescue.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Seconded, I don't want to outlive everyone I know<br />
**Ishemok:** Would it be possible to pull the Crazy Horse out of one black hole using the other's gravity? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That is 100% a lie<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You absolutely want to outlive everyone you know<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Just not THAT way<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Have we located where the Crazy Horse is?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Without knowing the location of the ship, figuring out a rescue is a bit of a challenge.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Not precisely, we could attempt to pinpoint its location<br />
*Skig is not sure what everyone is going on about, as long as the Lister outlives her, Skig feels she has done her job.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Let's send out some probes and see if we can get additional reads<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 nod in unison*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I believe finding its exact location will greatly assist with the feasibility of whether we can rescue them.<br />
**Kurij:** That is typically how rescues work<br />
>The twins suddenly stop tapping away on their console and collapse to the ground, apparently having some sort of siezure<br />

*Zox thinks that the gravitational fields are just a degenerate form of wrestling, and that somehow this is to be solved by a combination of holds, grabs, and pins.*<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** That could be Zox<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But they would have to have worked pretty quickly if that is the case, from our perspective they've been trapped in there for years, but for them it's only been a minute or two<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Starfleet is the best, time doesn't change that.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Would an exploding Jem'Hadar ship have caused it?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do we have enough of a signal to determine the strength and waveform of the warp signal, an Excelsior class ship will definitely have a much different signature and be larger than Jem'Hadar fighters.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** No, someone had to create this intentionally<br />
