>Captains log, stardate 61158.2. We were en-route to the Aldiri system to conduct trade negotiations when we received a distress call from a Kelorian colony near the Tzenkethi border.
The colony is experiencing severe malfunctions in their weather control grid, and have requested Federation assistance to repair it.The planet is beset with naturally occurring ion storms, and with the grid offline, the entire colony is in grave danger.
I managed to convince Amondi to let me lead the away team myself. But only if I took Zox with me. Dr. Viraseti and Commander Skig are leading the repair efforts, and Murry and I are coordinating with the colony in case an evacuation is needed. Hopefully it doesn't come to that.<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: Skig and Commander Viraseti are investigating the issues with the weather control emitter. Captain Baras, Zox, and Murry are discussing contingency plans with the colony administrator Anjek.<br />

*Skig is checking to see if they can properly determine when the next Ion Storm will strike so they have a timeframe for bringing repairs online.*<br />
**Anjek:** We simply must find some way to repair the weather control system. Evacuating the colony and abandoning all of our research is not a palatable option for us<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** I understand that Administrator, but if the grid cannot be repaired in time, it may be the only option <br />

**Anjek:** Fleeing from the planet and leaving hundreds of delicate experiments to be ravaged by the ionic storms hardly sounds like a drill<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It looks like there is some sort of transient interference from the Migratronic Aviary Transponder.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** You are correct, if we have to flee it's definitely not a drill anymore. But I'm sure Lieutenant Commanders Skig and Viraseti will wrap this up shortly, barring any unusual circumstances. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** That is a good option, let me see if I can adjust the relay system to remodulate the capacitance without impacting the Connubial Dampeners.<br />
**Anjek:** You will forgive me if I do not share your confidence, your colleagues do not seem to be able to roll very well<br />
*Skig nods in total agreement to the destruction of the Fourth Wall due to horrific dice rolls.*<br />

*Skig rejoices at not getting a complication for the first time today.*<br />
**Anjek:** The ionic storms here are an inconvenience, but they enable our entire research project<br />
**Anjek:** By harnessing the ionic energy with our weather control grid, we are able to study the interactions of complex ionic systems in a way that our scientists have never before been able<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Then should you not pre-emtively evacuate non-essential staff in the event of some catastrophe?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Viraseti, it seems like there is some sort of variable frequency change impacting the ionic range. Can you check the colony ionic weather patterns and see if this is a new phenomenon or something expected?<br />

*Captain Baras laughs*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Very well, although my bedside manner talking through the psychological disorders present in weather patterns is limited to merely encouraging rain to not be quite so acidic.<br />

*Skig stands up, does the "Picard Maneuver" to pull down her shirt. Glares crossly at the control relay, takes a deep breath, and smashes her fist into solid metal panel just below the buttons.*<br />
*Skig then kicks the side of the control panel after choosing what looks like a suitable location for her irritation.*<br />

>The storm front in the distance suddenly begins to roll rapidly across the sands, towards the colony<br />

>Within a matter of seconds, the storm slams into the perimitter of the weather control emitters, surrounding the colony<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The emitters are holding for now, but I don't know how long that will last<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Is this a new occurence though?  Something must have happened to precipitate this change.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Agreed, this happened far too suddenly<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Might there be some place underground to seek shelter against this?<br />
**Anjek:** Our facility is built into the cliff face, but the geology here offers little protection against ionic radiation <br />
**Anjek:** That is why we need the weather grid<br />
*Skig checks the system logs for the normal behavior of the ion storms versus what was just observed to determine if this effect has been getting worse over time or if there is some sort of system malfunction that is causing the issue.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** But there are no reports of ion storms of this intensity before your expedition set up shop?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** So what do you suggest commander? We can't shut down the grid in the midst of this storm<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** What's being used to generate power for the grid? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** The frequencies are modulating rapidly too try and overcome the defenses and the storm intensity is increasing. It may almost be fruitful to evacuate the planet, turn off the weather control grid, then turn it back on at a much lower power and judge the response of the ionic storm.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Agreed Commander. The situation has gotten out of hand. I'm ordering an evactuation. Baras to Lister, initiate emergency transport.<br />
>There is no response to the captain's order, and no transports take place.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** Baras to Lister, respond.<br />

>INTERIOR - Crew Lounge: As the red alert klaxon blares, any further response to Zox's violent outburst is cut short as Tural stands up and leaves. All of the attendees begin streaming out of the lounge, leaving the away team, Anjek , and Botok behind.<br />

>The ship begins maneuvering, and the Cardassian cruiser is no longer visible through the large windows in the crew lounge<br />

**Chief Botok:** Well that puts a bit of a damper on the festivities, eh sir?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Or extra explosives to the festivities<br />
*Zox rushes to the armory.*<br />

**Chief Botok:** Is your duty station in engineering? Where can I be of some use?<br />
*Captain Baras pulls Murry and Zox aside from Skig and Botok*<br />

*Skig is talking to Chief Botok.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/CaptainBaras.PNG" alt="Captain Baras" width="50" height="50">**Captain Baras:** I'm concerned about any actions we take affecting the timeline, even if that possibility is remote<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Let's go, we will need to reroute extra power to the shields because the torpedoes on that ship will crumple our standard arrays.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think we're in a dream, rather than a temporal event. It's quite likely, given the ionic storm was causing us to pass out, that the frequencies in the storm are responding to our brainwaves. After all, in a temporal event the crew would see us as strangers rather than responding as if we're additional crew. <br />

*Zox appears confused by this talk.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I do think we need to take care not to have bad things happen to us, though. In a normal dream, we wake up when startled. I don't think the storm will permit that, though, so if someone were to become grievously injured during the course of the dream they may be stuck like that until we're able to awaken<br />
*Zox Searches for weapons.*<br />

>Counselor's Log - I only have a moment of peace away from the others. I hope this remains intact after this, though I expect it will not. Still, the act of repeating it will help with retention. The working theory is that the ionic storm is causing us to relive of the USS Lister's battles, a flight from a Cardassian cruiser that left some trauma on Skig. We thought that hindsight would allow a cleaner resolution than in reality, but it appears we only delayed the inevitable and looped back to the beginning. I'm concerned for Skig's wellbeing if we continue to repeat this loop, but I'm more concerned that we won't get the chance. The Cardassian cruiser is now ionized. Things are escalating. End recording.<br />

*Zox smlies real good, revealing lots of ketchup and bits of a bottle.*<br />
**Anjek:** What happened? Calm them? I knew it was a mistake asking for help from the Federation...<br />
**Anjek:** We just wanted to keep our weather grid going so we could perform or research, my colleagues warned me that the Federaion always causes more problems than they solve....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** You have some intelligent colleagues.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** But clearly your experiments perturbed a native form of life that we didn't understand nor adequately respected when your research began. Only you have the secrets we need.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Wait...<br />
**Anjek:** We attempted to communicate with them when we first encountered them on this planet, but they do not seem to be capable of any sort of meaningful communication<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Have you tried this before?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I implore you to manually override and oower down the entire research station.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** *power<br />
**Anjek:** They have some level of animalistic intelligence yes, but they are only capable of communicating empathically. They don't have a liguistic intelligence<br />
**Anjek:** They are no more advanced than a pack animal<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Not one you have identified at least.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Well it's up to you. You can find out how advanced they are some day or you can have the rest of your neurons fried from static. I think it's worth it to try shutting down all the things.<br />
**Anjek:** It doesn't matter anyways, we're all going to die here, same as the others<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Same as the others?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Which others?<br />
**Anjek:** I lost two graduate students to these empathic attacks<br />
**Anjek:** The lifeforms seem to be able to attack our minds empathically, they cause a cascade of neurotransmitters until the target dies of cardiac arrest<br />
**Anjek:** Until now, I didn't know what the targets were actually experiencing<br />
**Anjek:** But apparently they are forcing their victims to relive their darkest moments until their own brains kill them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** That would make sense for what I am feeling, which also explains this recurring phenomenon.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Quite inventive. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** That sort of means they are intelligent beyond the credit you give them.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Quite a bit, if they're able to target and aim this sort of empathy<br />
**Anjek:** Not necessarily. The venom from a snake can have complicated impacts on your nervous system, but the snake does not know your neurology<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** It may also be that they are in fear, terror, and scared, and trying to impress that upon the person receptive to them.<br />
**Anjek:** You bleeding heart Federation types want to project intelligence on every living thing you encounter<br />
*Anjek looks at Skig*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Not true, for instance, I'm relatively convinced at this moment that you are not entirely sentient. Therefore, I project intelligence was your dump stat.<br />
**Anjek:** Interesting hypothesis, but then why do they kill their victims?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Oh, just tell us how to turn your research station off.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** If they don't know our physiology or what we are capable of, or not, based on their completely different physical existence, they are likely bewildered by the death of the person they are communicating with.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Revenge, perhaps? Or simply lashing out to try and stop the pain? I suspect, and perhaps I am wrong, but I suspect that this is more complicated than a simple chemical compound. <br />
**Anjek:** No. After we die in here, the creatures will move away, your crew can repair the weather control grid, and my graduate students will finish our research<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** No, they won't<br />

*Skig sacrifices Hailey Murry to the ion storms to appease them.*<br />

*Zox begins to ponder this cosmic trolley problem.*<br />

>Skig pulls out her tricorder and runs a detailed analysis of the aparatus. There is no obvious control system, nor any visible power source. It seems like the containment field is being powered by the energy of the ionic life-forms directly. Skig can see no easy way to shut down the containment system without killing the life forms inside. Somehow, she must find some way to disrupt the containment field without draining the life forms of their bio-energy.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Is it feasible to overload the containment field and cause it to fail-open?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We may be able to destroy the device's power grid if we can somehow introduce enough external power<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But we would have to be careful that the energy source wasn't harmful to the life-forms<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We may also be able to penetrate the containment just enough for a transporter beam to get a lock on the life-forms inside. Assuming there is anything to lock on to<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** Can we get a lock on any of the ones that are outside the containment field? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Good question Hailey, as I'm not sure the transporters have any way to lock on to energy beings.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti takes out her tricorder*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** What if we reverse the polarity of the containment field?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** That...could work, depending on how defuse they can get<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** overloading could be too risky.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Good point, an overload might collapse the field entirely<br />
*Hailey Murry uses her tricorder to scan the field*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** The containment field is powered by the life forms, perhaps opening a small hole that would allow them to flee until the system fails from lack of power?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** We could take advantage of the wavelength of the field here. Rather than overload it with power, we can add it in so the additions destructively interfere enough to create gaps. It's a diffuse being, which means it may be able to slip out through even the smaller holes. <br />
*Skig wonders when Hailey developed the ability to interpret Skig's plan into a more concrete example.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Yes, that would be the option I was aiming for if overloading is too risky.<br />

**Chief Botok:** And if you get too hot, the meat burns<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** The captain sent the report to Starfleet, I would expect that they will dispatch a long-term research team to the planet<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Is there no way to ban research on this planet temporarily?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** Well the Kelorian's won't be able to coninue their research, but the xeno-anthropology team from Starfleet will want to learn more about these life-forms<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I don't think they'll be able to set anything meaningful up<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Presumably the Federation will open diplomatic relations with them, and through section 18B, sub paragraph 102, bullet points 4-9 inclusive, they would be protected from hostile experimentation per the "sentient non-organic clause" stipulated by the Organians.<br />
*Zox lights a cigar, and puts a briefcase on the table.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Okay, who wants to pay for this? I'm sure it's good.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** What's in it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I collect. I secure.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I do not know what's in it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** I don't think we should, if we benefit from their research on sentient life-forms against their will, are we any better than they are?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** I would only want to have this investigated such that we know how to live more amicably with them. Perhaps our ion-pulse engines give them headaches and we shouldn't even be here, for example<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** I'm sure Commander Bachar will have some great ideas on how this can be used to further the Federation's interests.<br />
*Skig is fully expecting to be disintegrated by someone from Section-31 any second.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** I think we should look into it, if only to ensure that Anjek was working alone<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry:** But overall, I'm with Doctor Zerra, if we want to study them then we should do so the right way<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** There is a possibility that warp containment or ion-containment fields could be adapted to make them even more resilient and stable.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Yes, hopefully Star Fleet is sending a long-term research team with a Tellerite or two to open diplomatic conversations.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox:** Well, we are all done with this for now and someone else will take this information. A toast for none of our brains becoming toast.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** Indeed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra:** That is something I can drink to<br />
*Skig raises a glass.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig:** And a chance to say "goodbye" to my old mentor one more time.<br />
