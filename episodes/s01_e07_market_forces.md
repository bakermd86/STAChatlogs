>Captain's log, Stardate 61489.4: With the Lister back in spacedock for another rebuild, I've been summoned to a tribunal to review my "command competence." Apparently two major structural rebuilds in as many months is considered "substandard command performance." 

>I am slightly offended by the suggestion, but I will simply have to present my case to the admiralty. In the meantime, I am wary of another repeat of what happened the last time the Lister was out of commission.

>So in my absense: I have ordered all crew to remain aboard the station, and I have ordered Zox to keep security details on-duty, and keep tabs on the crew. I don't think it would reflect well on my record if any of my senior officers got kidnapped during a visit to spacedock. Again.<br />

>INTERIOR - Station K4 Arboretum: With the crew confined to the station per the captain's orders, most of the Lister crew are congregating either in the station lounge or the arboretum, if not simply staring listlessly out the windows of their guest quarters. Zox and Murry are taking a look at the flora, and Murry is doing her best to convince Zox not to eat any of it<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, finally, time to relax.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We should get a bigger one of these on the Lister<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** NO DAMMIT, YOU CROSSCONNECT THE FLAXNARL CAPACITOR TO THE BLANDAL MANIFOLD!<br />
*Skig stomps by yelling into her comm badge.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** WHat would you call a bar in an arboretum?<br />
*Hailey Murry narrows her eyes at Zox*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** ...what? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well I don't know. You know your language better. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But it seems like a great idea!<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 come over with a certain spring in their step, carrying a portable computer terminal.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commander Zox, Counselor Murry, we were hoping we would find you here given the Commander's proclivity for eating foliage. We attempted to ask the computer your location, but it seems Captain Baras locked out location queries as an anti-kidnapping measure.<br />
**Ishemok:** I am glad to see you doing much better.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I am glad to see you doing much better.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes we have recovered fully from Counselor Murry shooting us<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As you may recall, that Ferengi broker who worked for the Aldazed Cartel left behind an encrypted ledger before his escape. If we recall correctly, Counselor Murry knocked it from his hands at great personal risk to herself. We have been working on breaking its encryption since then. Recently, we were able to decrypt its contents.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We had originally thought it would make sense to ask the two of you to look into it, between your investigative skills commander and your knowledge of bureaucratic structures counselor. However, Ensign Ishemok's unfortunate situation ended up presenting a perfect opportunity.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We realized that his unique financial accumen combined with his new ability to directly interface with the Lister computers made him the perfect person to analyze this ledger. So with the Lister out of commission, we took the liberty of taking the main computer functions offline and allowing Ensign Ishemok to run his cognitive functions directly on the main computer.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh? Very interesting!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** YOU WHAT?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The ledger contained a long list of numbered accounts and their transactions. Ishemok was able to run an analysis comparing the latinum values of the transactions against reported transactions from monitoried entities in order to identify some of the numbered accounts. At least those which are registered with entities that share their financial reporting data with the Federation.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We asked him to identify any suspicious entities from that list. He was able to correlate the transaction ammounts from the non-reporting accounts against transaction totals from the governments that do report to the Federation. Using that data, he identified a highly suspect Gorn hedge fund.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** This hedge fund has only ever taken deposits from numbered accounts in the ledger.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ensign Ishemok went through their investments and found that they are the majority owner a highly suspect "holding company" registered in Breen space. This holding company caught his attention because it "has no listed assets."<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Throk will not be happy to learn there is a Gorn Hedge Fund. Hedges are delicious.</font><br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The only active contract associated with the holding company is a management contract for the pension fund of a farming consortium in Klingon space<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We accessed the pension fund's balance sheet, but we were unable to progress further<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, everything you have just said is suspicious.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were hoping you could help<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, highly suspicious<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We suspect the Aldazed were comitting financial crimes<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Why yes! This sounds like exactly the sort of task we need to flex some mental muscles.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I do love the idea of a Klingon farming consortium, though<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ensign Ishemok suspects that the pension fund is being used to conceal a paper trail back to the Aldazed<br />

I only really remember this because on my favorite Engineering forum someone spammed all the "cross joint welding Nacelles for increased stability" threads with advertisements to come get salvage.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** but you'd appraise it as worth more than 1.6Kbars?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I believe during the occupation of Bajor, so a lot of Bajorans were undoubtedly killed operating in unsafe conditions.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think just yet, we don't have a ship with a warp drive and stealing one is a Reprimand waiting to happen, but I think this is interesting enough to look into in more detail. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Besides, they can't fix the Lister THAT quick.<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect group could possibly hide alternate versions of selves in Holodeck 6 claiming group bonding time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wonder if they have a rental ship for us in the mean time.<br />
**Throk:** Then Throk suspect group could steal shuttle craft with warp capable drive from loading dock 7 through Jeffries Tube from Holodeck 6 access shaft.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, maybe we should wait until the Lister is fixed... We've only got one working shuttle now and I... don't trust that thing<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** No offence ma'am<br />
*Skig looks confused.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Old Faithless is a perfectly functional shuttle that is able to support warp capable travel through time distortions and gravitic anomalies.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It does need a new coat of paint though.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis indicates only a 35% chance that the shuttle would explode when activating its warp core<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think it would be better if we got permission from the captain to use some other, smaller ship that isn't going to fall apart on us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** One with an atmosphere and sleeping accommodations<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I bet you asked your parents for permission to go out when you were in high school too<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** My ships only fall apart when they come in contact with clumsy crew members!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What we really need to do, is go to a Sora VII Firestarters game.<br />

*Zox shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I don't think that will help, given that the person we want to talk with has never played a game with the team he is contracted to play for.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yeah but it will put us close to the manager.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Why?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I'm all for a less contrived plan.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm up for anything that will get me out of the station, the Lister is in hock for another 2 weeks, and I am already going stir crazy<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wouldn't we be better suited to track down the Executive Level members of Prophet's Fortune and determine Kosal's location based on banking and accounting ledgers they would have on hand.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We could use it as the excuse to get out of the ship<br />
*Skig is NOT looking for any excuse to be away from the Lister.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, that is good, practical advice, but any sneaky rat is going to have eyes and ears around. We can't go asking good questions in the open.<br />
*Skig thinks you all are crazy to wish to be separated from the Skig's precious ship while it is in need of tender care and maintenance.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We can't?<br />
*Skig believes subterfuge is setting two traps, one obvious one and the other labeled "Coffee Maker".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's a good way to find a shorted EPS conduit, but a lousy way to find a good criminal<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Zox is right, we need a cover before we go poking around<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You can't let them know you're onto them<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Criminals are paranoid by nature<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Now, if we have long range sensors and can directly query the location of Empok Nor, I'm all for abandoning subtlety<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect if fake Ball Team had former Orion Syndicate operative who is pining for lost love as attractive face of operation that arrangements would be easier.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Good Throkk! <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I can rig up some extended sensors on Old Faithless and the location of Empok Nor is relatively well known.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The Empok Nor should have been salvaged years ago. What are the odds that it somehow got refurbished and is still in operation? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Not good.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Uhhhh, given what you guys found I'd say 100%<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You guys didn't get out enough as kids<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Honestly, as long as everyone was in EVA suits to deal with whatever biogen contagion there was, it might be possible and hiding the output as an underperorming salvage operation makes perfect sense.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** When you need to hide your duffel bag of drugs, you don't put it your locker. You give it to your cousin's girlfriend's sister to put it in the storage compartment of the crashed sand skimmer behind her house<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Captain is incommunicado in his hearing, so someone will hvae to ask the XO<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not me or Skig though, she hates us for no good reason<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I will clear it. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I can go distract Bachar by making small talk with her.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That should completely convince her to barricade herself in the executive lounge bathroom for at least four hours, like yesterday.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No need, this is a reasonable plan.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She just shot you down completely? I would get it if she did that to me, but she likes you. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Or, well maybe not "likes" you, but she respects you at least. I think.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Then I suppose we have no choice but to drop the matter and return to our quarters<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Never, my quarters do not overlook the Lister, someone put me on the opposite side of the station.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 attempt to wink at Zox and Murry, but largely fail to pull off the maneuver*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I think I'm going to switch spots with Throk, he is overlooking the Lister.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 take out a few small chips from the interface unit installed in their brains and attach one each to the back of Zox, Murry, and Throk's necks*<br />

>After a short, sharp pain, Murry, Zox, Skig and Throk all see a flash or light and then they are standing in some sort of weird void with the twins and Ishemok<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** In light of the Commander's surveilance, we have established a local area neural network for us to continue this conversation<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is not my fault the tables in the Officer's Club are more comfortable than the floor, also, I can watch the Lister as I drift off to sleep.<br />
**Ishemok:** Woo hoo! LAN party!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed<br />
**Throk:** Throk not have LAN party in long time. Last time Throk ate all CAT-3 pink cables. They taste like raspberries.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Thank you, commanders. Now, how shall we proceed here?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** ...and that's when he was trasnferred to security.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, we agree with your assessment that something is unusual about the situation<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our expectation based on the available data is that Commander Bachar would approve of further investigatory actions agains the Aldazed Cartel <br />
**Throk:** Since Ledger come from experience of Commander Bachar being captured, can only assume she is complicit in activity of Cartel, therefore, would not want further investigation.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It's pretty common knowledge that she was in intelligence before being assigned to the Lister. It's possible that she's aware of things going on in that front which we aren't<br />
**Throk:** Also, Throk assume blue objects always cold, so Throk assumption not always best one.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm. One explanation is that there's somethign she doesn't want starfleet to know about. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah she left Starfleet Intelligence and transfered to the fleet years ago, whatever she knows is way too far out of date to be meaningful<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Assuming she actually left Starfleet Intelligence, yeah<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** She doesn't happen to have any saved funds in any of this stuff, does she? <br />
**Throk:** Throk not sure when Starfleet exhibit signs of Intelligence, after all, Starfleet let me in.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's definetly an idea, but one generally doesn't rise through the ranks so young if latinum motivates them<br />
**Ishemok:** No double dealing detected. end of line.<br />
**Ishemok:** also no triple dealing detected. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** My nose tells me it's reputational, not financial damage that motivates this secrecy.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oh if we're trashing her reputation, I'm all in for that <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We're not trashing her reputation without very rock hard evidence that it deserves to be trashed<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We should not allow ourselves to be motivated by animus Lieutenant<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Not everyone can recover from dozens of demotions<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is also possible that there is an entirely innocent explanation <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To be fair, I'm rather opposed to trashing her hard-ass obnoxiousness.<br />
*Zox blinks.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It is quite possible she knows things about the Cartel that will get us all killed and and cannot tell us about them.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Im not sure organized crime knows much innocence.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Organized crime specializes in innocence. Those are the easiest people to prey on<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The likelihood of Bachar actually not being in Starfleet Intelligence any more is about the same as me requesting transfer from the Lister.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, given some of our recent assignments, I doubt the Lister is getting randomly generated "go do something missions", there are ulterior motives at play. <br />
*Skig winks at GM.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm, we don't know why she was transferred out, but we do know she was sought out by the cartel so it's fair to assume they're part of the reason why<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are considering alternatives, and we are not sure that we have much choice but to continue on our current path. With the captain indisposed, we cannot raise the matter up our chain of command without Commander Bachar's approval. And we do not know how long this intelligence will be actionable.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, the question is, can we head out and act on some of this while remaining incognito? <br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Kosal Oram</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, if I remain behind, with say, your communicators scattered around and that is how Bachar is tracking you, and I make an effort to annoy her while making it look like you are all avoiding her, that will likely get you extra time to make the quick tricks around.<br />
**Ishemok:** What if we cook the books and transfer shares of Prophet's Fortune to the Ferengi Federation?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think that is just stealing<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If the Aldazed cartel are as competent as they appear, it is highly likely that will be made aware of the financial records we queried. So whatever we do, we should assume that the intelligence is fleeting<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think that'd be pretty hilarious stealing, though<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not sure it helps us learn anything though<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It'll piss off the cartel, though<br />
**Throk:** Throk know of Bajoran Vogon Poetry Appreciation Competition, Throk can apply to participate and use that as excuse to leave space station.<br />
**Throk:** Throk love good Vogon Poetry.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Will it though? Do they actually care about this talent agency? It seems like the thing they really care about is the station, and that is just owned by this Oram guy<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** At least on paper<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh, true, it's not actually through the talent agency<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is also why he was transferred to security, as use of Vogon Poetry is considered an interrogation technique so heinous, even the Dominion banned it.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Maybe Throk can get some info out of this guy with his poetry then<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How long would it take for us to pay Kosal a visit? <br />
**Ishemok:** Rule 45: Expand or Die. I think this pension fund is in need of buy-out and subsequent auduting. <br />
*Lt. Malat chuckles*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It depends what vessel we are able to secure use of. At the moment, we have no means of travel<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Right, so step 1, decide where you are going. Step 2, find excuse to leave station, Step 3, I get the Lister repaired.<br />
**Ishemok:** We can't act overtly, but if we give some 'free' advice to a competing fund.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The station does have several Danube class runabouts, capable of reaching Bajor in less than a day<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But without the Commander's approval we do not know how we would secure their usage.<br />
**Throk:** Throk go fill in application form for poetry tournament!<br />
*Throk happliy trundles off.*<br />
**Ishemok:** Think of all the panic and volitility to take advantage of if people knew their pension fund was fueling an illegal drug lab teeming with slave labor?<br />
*Throk stops.*<br />
>Throk wanders off into the dark inky void of the computer world<br />

**Throk:** So... they bought into American Pharmaceutical corporations?<br />
**Throk:** They common enough Ishemok, I think for true crime need to also include Swiss banking.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do you think we can convince her that we're taking Skig off planet to get her away from the Lister? <br />
**Ishemok:** Those would have been a safe bet, if not for their collapse in 2052.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** NEVER.<br />
*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** See? Throk can pick her up, and then we can basically get her out of peoples' hair<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** It would explain the large retinue<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wait didn't Kolea request a bereavement leave to notify J'Davir's parents of his death?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If she hasn't left yet, maybe she can give us a ride, take a detour to Bajor and drop us off<br />
*Skig makes note to set Murry's room to run at a constant 57C and the shower to emit a high pitched murderous screech noise when activated.*<br />
**Ishemok:** That makes sense, but certainly Bachar has eyes all over Bajor, given the war.<br />
*Hailey Murry is oblivious to this plan for now, but has been around the block already and knows how things turned out to the last person who messed with her shower*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't think she has eyes all over it, though if we hit the headlines she'd probably know<br />
*Skig is prepared to vent Murry to space in the event Murry blows up parts of the Lister, AGAIN.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Then again, so would Captain Baras<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If Bajor is our only option<br />
*Throk is confused why all the rooms and doors in this place are black.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** ...then well, it's our only option<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well if Kolea gives us a ride, it would be hard to justify a "quick" detour into Cardassian space to visit a derelict space station<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** If we want to do that, we need to secure our own ride<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think Bajor is a better option, I don't really want anyone to go investigate a strange space station we know nothing about<br />
*Throk finds a room with a mirror and starts talking to handsome Gorn who is not giving him directions how to leave this weird limbo land he is in.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** How many people can we sneak onto Kolea's shuttle?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Assuming a standard Danube layout without science labs, it has room for 6 passengers<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Since the Lister has no shuttles, I assume she would get a Runabout.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, what Malat said.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, we can sneak over, or we can check to see if we can head over for a training exercise<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Parrises squares teams are 5 people...<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The problem with Parrises Squares, is if you get hurt, the injuries are distinct.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** And they would not go un-noticed by Bachar.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** They would not go un-noticed by Dr Zerra, you mean<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Bachar doesn't necessarily have to find out<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The only place eyes aren't, is in here.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Could be a good plan.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But do be cautious<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Assuming Skig can piss off the commander enough to keep her attention while we slip out unnoticed<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I don't know if we can sneak out if she's keeping an eye on people as much as she claims, especially if she's keeping an ear on us as well<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, if that's the best we got.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I think we physically all need to relocate to a holodeck for a while, and then if you all happen to take the connecting maintenance tube and follow that to the shuttle bay, then jump into Kolea's shuttle before she departs that would be fine. You would need to leave various trackable options with me in the holodeck.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Look on the bright side: If Bachar is hiding something, it's not like she can report you up the chain of command for ignoring her orders<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Then I'll just constantly insist Bachar review all the maintenance logs for the last twenty four hours.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We should probably also change out of our uniforms into civilian clothes<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Mostly because I don't think these maintenance crews are properly motivated. It is like they don't want to work with the smell of charred enlisted people in main engineering.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't they realize how important it is to get that smell out of the area so the chemicals causing the odor don't interfere with the warp calibration!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm. For a second, i thought I was cold blooded.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nothing. Nothing at all.<br />

**GM:** The Federation has "done much to earn this planet its freedom"? For 60 years the Cardassians ravaged "this planet". My home! For 60 years they murdered our families! Stripped our resources! Treated us as chattle! For 60 years we fought! and died!And struggled! Alone! And the Federation? The Federation signed a PEACE TREATY WITH THEM!<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We have heard of something to add a little, zip and pop, beyond the normal..yes that!<br />
**Talak:** They sell anything you can imagine there. Most rare, and very exotic<br />
**Talak:** And extremely dangerous<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You seem familiar, can you tell us a bit more? Got a lot of customers there?<br />
**Talak:** The sort of place you don't want to go without a good life insurance policy, lest you regret it<br />
**Talak:** Oh yes, many customers there<br />
**Talak:** It is the sort of pace that attracts exactly the high-risk lifestyles that allow you to charge the highest premiums<br />

**Talak:** She sells some.. very rare spices<br />
**Talak:** As rare as they come, and her customers are very discerning and have very particular tastes when it comes to their food<br />
**Throk:** Throk not following translator correctly, did you say "spices" or "species"?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You must 'ave learn meny things. Does this, Jasanis, have a favorite dish?<br />
**Talak:** You know I can't recall the name, but it has a very expensive white sauce<br />
**Throk:** Duracell White?<br />
**Talak:** That sounds right, perhaps that was it<br />
**Talak:** Well it's been nice to chat, but I'd better be on my way<br />
**Talak:** I have appointments to keep<br />

*Talak tosses a Cardassian isolinear rod to Zox*<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, I think our situation is a little more complex now.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That gave a lot of information, and some helpful invitations<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well at least we don't need to worry about a cover story to dock at the station<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But I think we're probably gointg to need some significantly better disguises<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest Murry wear Voth body suit.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well that's true, Everyone get some cooking clothes on.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Or a detour back to the Lister to switch out for other members<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Too tricky to get into and out of Cardassian space.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Not worth the risk<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Jasanis already knows we're onto her, if we detour all the way back she'll be long gone<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Assuming she isn't already<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, I think it's a good idea to see if we can go ruin her day either way<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's less about personal vendetta. Having pull over a commanding officer is a threat to Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It sounded like it was the other way around<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But it's not mutually exclusive.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She said she considers her debt to the Commander repaid<br />

*Zox blinks and thinks about what he has said.*<br />
*Zox looks at 11 and 10.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk also suggest larger size pockets. Throk read Admiral Picard memoir about No-Pocket-Sucks uniforms.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Aye sir<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm really wondering how much Bachar already knew about all of this. I feel like we're getting entangled in something that she has a good understanding of and isn't touching for whatever reason<br />
*Zox looks to T'Kor*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Sizzlin Sauce<br />
**Throk:** Throk 100% in agreement with Murry, after all, Bachar told all officers here not to get involved.<br />
*Kosal Oram wakes up from his nap and comes out of the sleeping compartment*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No one, not even hardened criminals who would kill their 'mates for a peice of eight, can't appreciate good cooking.<br />
**Throk:** Bachar likely expecting gruesome dismemberment or rescue necessary.<br />

*Throk replicates up some more Bajoran Scout Cookies.*<br />

*Throk is waiting for a glorious suggestion.*<br />
*Throk is STILL waiting for a glorious suggestion.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I strongly suspect that they don't actually have chefs' ingredients there<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I mean, it's not like we could pass for mercenaries or hired killers<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If I had money, no idea where Ishemok put it, I'd bet that Bachar lacks the heart to bad things to Jasanis for something that happened in the past.<br />
**Throk:** Throk remind everyone that some species consider other species edible.<br />

>EXTERIOR - Space: Malat brings the transport into the docking area of Empok Nor. The station is of the same construction as Deep Space Nine, but it has been partly salvaged and several of the docking pylons are missing. The promenade has been extended with numerous modules extending out from its central core, each one seemingly haphazardly welded in with no thought to what was nearby. <br />

>The docking clearance from Talak seems to have been on-the-level, as no one has opened fire. The station is buzzing with activity, dozens of ships are docking, undocking, jumping to warp, etc. The docking area seems to have no traffic control in place, it's a chaotic free-for-all<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are inclined to agree with the Counselor. Commander Zox seems to have lost sight of our objective, and possibly his mind<br />
**Throk:** Throk quite certain the best solution here is to identify location of Jasanis, then set main power plant to explode, then properly capture her escape pod this time, unlike last time when she escaped after destroying stealth station where she was encountered with this group previously.<br />
**Throk:** Also, for true retrospective, we should all get captured to keep plot consistent.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Flew out to a starbase on the edge of Federation space to conduct a command review of a first-time captain of the oldest ship in Starfleet<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Maybe they are just bored and in need of a war, so they just review the troops?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Take off that chef hat, it seems to be cutting off the bloodflow to your brain<br />
*Throk thinks about saying something witty, realizes it is not witty, decides to keep mouth shut for once.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay, but if cold-blood is flowing, that would indicate they do not think Baras suitable for this.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ah, I take it you never actually left Intelligence? <br />
*Zox glares at Hailey.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** No, I transfered to fleet command after the war, I wanted a normal career<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But everything about the Lister is suspicious: a 90 year old ship pulled out of mothballs, given to a 73 year old captain who has failed the command proficiency exam 12 times, staffed with Starfleet's least wanted, and then assigned to a prestigous posting along the Cardassian border<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's good cover to sponge up intel using the group-w bench.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Every senior officer on the ship has an active intelligence file open. I can't view them with my clearance, but I can see that they exist<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** It stinks<br />
*Skig is not going to point out that she is not "least wanted" she has just not put in for a transfer for the last 20 years.*<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That is...really troublesome<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So wait, what happened what you got kidnapped? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I was kept unconcious<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Drat. And you think Starfleet is up to something? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possible that memory engrams were still being carved even if sub or unconcious?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I don't know who is pulling the strings, but the Starfleet triumverate wouldn't be here unless one of them is involved<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Involved in something sketchy? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I don't know what game they're playing, but I don't intend to be a pawn<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or they expect us to not find something, given the situation Bachar outlined and as a result have plausible denialability for whatever the outcome is.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** That ledger that led you to Empok Nor? I included it in the report we filed on our last encounter with the Aldazed<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Starfleet intelligence should have been able to find anything you were able to<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But the file on that report shows "No useful intelligence"<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But they didn't have Ishemok's keen eyes pooring over data<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** No, someone buried it<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That's exceptionally troublesome<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Until we figure out what is going on, no one else enters the circle of trust on this<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Not even the captain<br />
*Skig looks at datapad.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** We need to get ahead of this thing, so we don't end up buried under it<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Absolutely. I imagine they put the Captain in charge to keep things relatively under control. He's very passive for a captain<br />
