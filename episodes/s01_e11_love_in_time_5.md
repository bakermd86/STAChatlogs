![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Lock on to Lt Commander Viraseti and Dr Gallego and transport them up, but do not remove them from the transporter buffer, reverse it and deposit them in the medical bay of the colony as they are likely infested with tribbles.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't break anything while I am gone.<br />
**Mowus:** Yyyyes<br />
*Skig transports to the medical bay to see what Dr Zerra is concerned about.*<br />
*Mowus is a little concerned with the readings, but his suit isn't reporting anything obvious yet*<br />
>When Skig materializes in sickbay, she sees Luatoria fawning over Gra'lan, offering him tea and rubbing his shoulders while Gra'lan politely tolerates her behavior. The tribbles which they beamed over earlier are crawling all over Luatoria's back, arms and shoulders, chittering happily <br />

*Gra'lan salutes his Commander and best engineer.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm.,.. yes Dr Zerra, what seems to be the issue?<br />
*Skig looks at Gra'lan.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** How are you doing?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Great!<br />
**Gra'lan:** Nothing like some danger!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** While I was doing medical checks on the personel here, I found that Luatoria had a slight fever<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Your fax seems to be pointing directly upwards?<br />
**Gra'lan:** I hope people get the message.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I brought her to medbay to look into it, and when you beamed over the tribbles, they did this<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... curious.<br />
*Dr. Zerra points to Luatoria and the tribbles crawling all over her*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Have you identified the source of the fever?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I took a blood sample, analyzing it now for any known pathogens<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Computer, can you locate Administrator Yalak and have him report to medical?<br />
**Computer Voice:** Affirmative<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks at this medical tricorder and nods*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It looks like Zanthi Fever, it's a viral infection that sometimes affects older Betazed women<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** That certainly explains a few things...<br />
*Skig wonders if Mowus' scaly but somehow soft and warm belly is attracting unnecessary attention from the Tribbles.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Wait what? What does this explain?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Well one of the symptoms of Zanthi Fever is a sort of crossing of wires in the empathic system. Instead of reading other people's emotions, the patient will start projecting their own emotional responses to others<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It explains the unusual neurotransmitter levels I have been reading in Skig, Viraseti, and some others<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I don't suppose this could have a massive effect on Tribbles?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It is possible, I don't think the impact of Zanthi Fever on tribbles has ever been studied<br />
**Gra'lan:** Hrm. <br />

**Oakadan:** Also, tribbles produce a hormone at the end of their reproductive cycle. If we can produce this, we can halt the tribbles' cycle and disperse them. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, you will stay here.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, Oakadan, that sounds great.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I will go with Dr Zerra to check on Viraseti and Gallego.<br />
**Luatoria Dural:** Ok, yes you run along little one<br />
*Luatoria Dural gestures dismissively at Skig*<br />

*Throk gets out high-powered cooking stun taser.*<br />
**Throk:** This turn stupid bird into boiled tastiness in 10 seconds.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Oooook<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Very useful<br />
**Throk:** Throk think this much less likely to cause Skig to be angry by using disruptor rifle to cook beetles near ship exterior hull like last time.<br />
*Throk offers Lt Malat what looks like a 2 kg, partially melted Daktarian Plated Beetle coated in a light garllic batter.*<br />
**Geret:** I haven't found anything interesting out. unfortunately.<br />
*Throk pats Geret on the head.*<br />
**Throk:** It okay, later you help me find bird and we can cook and eat together in bonding ritual of Glue-trions.<br />
**T'kor:** I found a small device attached to Skig's computer. It's too advanced to be replicated, and it has no obvious markings that commercial products usually have. By my estimation, only four people on the ship have the proficiency to produce it. <br />
**Geret:** But there is another Elaysian man that looks very much like Dr. Zerra. He never spoke of a brother?<br />
**T'kor:** Myself, of course. Skig. Zox. And the Twins<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** His file indicates a brother<br />
**Throk:** Curious. Throk discover that commands to control Zox suit not come from main terminal but from direct interface to transmitter or override.<br />
**Throk:** Throk also pick up copies of Zox's medical implant, but they not very plant like, so Throk not understand, but looks complex.<br />
*Throk hands complex schematics to T'Kor to compare to the transmitter.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk wonder if transmitter share similarity to implant thing and made by same people?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I did some digging in Starfleet records, tried to get my hands on some details about their service records. I am pretty sure that Dr. Zerra helped create the Morphopage bioweapon that Section 13 used during the war<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So... I can't prove it, but even if he isn't involved I am pretty sure he is a war criminal.<br />

**Geret:** It just seems so odd Lt. Zerra seemed to be researching entirely mundane Caulobacter now. Very boring?<br />
**Throk:** For instance, during Dominion War, Throk determine that Klingon, Romulan, Jem'Hadar, Humans, Breen, Cardassians, and Bajorans all taste like chicken.<br />
**Geret:** I was expecting something devilish!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Is Caulobacter some other virus?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That affects humanoids?<br />

**Geret:** Why is everything in computers and diagrams today!<br />
**T'kor:** Okay so it looks like Zerra got the regulator and control circuits from off-board. There's no work order to manufacture them<br />
**Throk:** Caulobacter is a dangerous brachial virus that Dr Zerra has been doing research on and looking into viral pathgens across a broad spectrum of species and are quite invasive into ecosystems where few antivirual inhibitors can prevent their spread through contract, in addition to a long hibernation period which can see them resurface decades later and infect an entirely new generation of creatures. However, Gorn mostly immune, primary issue for me is they make PADDs and other small electronics taste horrible.<br />
**Geret:** pretty sus!<br />
**T'kor:** Would that be something which would be useful against tribbles?<br />
*Throk pulls a chunk of a PADD from between his teeth.*<br />
**Throk:** See, this taste nothing like chicken.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wait, is this Caulobacter a virus or a bacteria? Also: does it matter? Also: what is the difference between a virus and a bacteria? I'm not a scientist<br />
**Geret:** The notes say bacteria.<br />
**Throk:** Bacteria are relatively complex, single-celled creatures, many with a rigid wall, and a thin, rubbery membrane surrounding the fluid inside the cell. They can reproduce on their own. Fossilized records show that bacteria have existed for about 3.5 billion years, and bacteria can survive in different environments, including extreme heat and cold, radioactive waste, and the human body.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Throke said... wait, why do I care what Throk said<br />
**Throk:** Viruses are tinier: the largest of them are smaller than the smallest bacteria. All they have is a protein coat and a core of genetic material, either RNA or DNA. Unlike bacteria, viruses can't survive without a host. They can only reproduce by attaching themselves to cells. In most cases, they reprogram the cells to make new viruses until the cells burst and die. In other cases, they turn normal cells into malignant or cancerous cells.

Also unlike bacteria, most viruses do cause disease, and they're quite specific about the cells they attack. For example, certain viruses attack cells in the liver, respiratory system, or blood. In some cases, viruses target bacteria.<br />
**Geret:** Throk has started reading! Ya Throk!<br />
*Throk takes glasses off nose, opens ketchup packet and spreads it on glasses, chews them up.*<br />
**Throk:** Polycarbonate goes well with tomatoes.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There must be something we are overlooking<br />
**Geret:** Surely.<br />
*Throk stands above Malat and peers down at Geret.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk overlook Malat at Geret, that help?<br />
**Geret:** After all, it's possible Zerra asked for parts from the Twins<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** What do we know for sure: somehow, one of them is passing information off the ship without it being detected<br />
**Throk:** Seem plausible he would ask for help from Twins, as they are on board ship.<br />
**T'kor:** It's possible, but if Zerra asked the Twins for parts then there would have been a work order for them<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Not necessarily, you think the Twins can't modify computer records?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't think the computer will say anything they don't want it to say<br />
**T'kor:** Oh, true. Whoever might have done it would have the know-how to adjust that.<br />
**Throk:** Nonsense!<br />
**T'kor:** Let's see here...<br />
**Throk:** Computer, state the Twins are poopy pants.<br />
**Computer Voice:** Unable<br />
**Geret:** Well, the best thing we have going for us is, most people assume we are total misfits. Perhaps we should create false information that only gets to either the twins or zerra, and see which false information our enemies seem to have access to.<br />
**Throk:** Hmm...<br />
**Throk:** Small angry woman might be right.<br />
**Throk:** I like Geret's idea.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That's not a bad idea, but how do we know what information they have access to?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think we need a concrete plan, or some hard evidence to take to Bachar<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** So far, everything we find could implicate both the Twins and Zerra<br />
**T'kor:** Or even just one of the Twins<br />
**T'kor:** What did you find when you searched Zerra's office?<br />
**Throk:** I found stupid bird that needs to be eaten.<br />
**Throk:** Not sure why Zerra is keeping bird in office.<br />
**Throk:** Also, Throk simple person, Throk already tell small angry woman useful stuff.<br />
