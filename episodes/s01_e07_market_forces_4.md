**Throk:** Throk not remember what going on. This often happen in bar when Throk blacks out after drinking too much water.<br />
**Throk:** This water taste funny also. What does 180 proof mean?<br />
>INTERIOR - Malat's "new" trasport: Malat pulls up a tactical display showing the approaching Cardassian patrol craft, it is closing on the transport at a significant clip.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Any ideas? I don't think I can outrun them in this, and we certainly can't fight them in an unarmed transport craft.<br />
**Cardassian Officer:** Unidentified shuttlecraft. The Cardassian Border Authority has no record of your journey. Transmit your border control clearance immediately.<br />
*Throk hands out patches and tricornes.*<br />
**Ishemok:** Please Wait. Computing Coverstory.<br />

*Throk stares over the twin's shoulders.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Transmitting border passage clearance now<br />
**Throk:** No, red dot goes next to green dot. Also, we are blue dot and we don't want white dot to hit green dot.<br />
**Ishemok:** Beep Boop Beep<br />
*Lt. Malat patches in the forged border clearance from Ishemok and the Twins*<br />
>A few long moments pass in silence before the Cardassian patrol craft is seen moving away on the tactical display<br />

**Ishemok:** Okay team, that gets us past obstacle one. Do we have a cover story for when we land at station up to, oh, probably all the forms of no-goodery in the universe?<br />
**Cardassian Officer:** Everything seems to be in order, next time you should file your clearance in advance with the border control division on Linaka IV<br />
*Cardassian Officer cuts off communications and depars*<br />
**Throk:** Throk happy to inform Cardassians that "it's an older code, but it checks out."<br />
*Ishemok Zox yeilds coms to Malat, banking on Cardassian Solidarity.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well you've got a couple of hours to figure it out<br />
*Throk gets out boxes of Bajoran Scout Cookies.*<br />
**Throk:** Who not want to eat these?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's a winning idea! Not even the hardest hearts in the quadrant can resist those!<br />
**Throk:** We show up to sell them, even morally bankrupt pedophiles cannot say no.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Are we going to have to pass through this on the way back as well? <br />

*Throk flexes.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Did Throk just do a think?<br />
**Throk:** Throk not think, Throk just do. Throk expect superior intelligent Starfleet Officers to plan.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is this what they call the Beginners' Mind?<br />
*Throk looks knowingly at everyone ELSE.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk practice patience and observation. Throk simple mind not sure of many things.<br />
**Throk:** For instance, Throk notice stealth ship hiding inside warp signature of ship with talking angry man. Smaller stealth ship sneakily move to hide inside warp signature of our ship. Could mean hostile boarders, but Throk feel this minor information and all other smart people already know this, so Throk mostly talking for no reason.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Wait, what?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting.<br />
*Zox gets out a notepad.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Could you tell us more about this?<br />
**Throk:** Yes, small white dot move from here to here, inside warp signature position.<br />
*Throk drags fingernail across display screen to show movement of the ship, leaving a deep gouge in the display.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't see any warp signatures on the tactical display, whoever they are must be pretty good<br />
**Throk:** Throk remember why Skig scream he not leave claws out when touch capacitance screens.<br />
**Ishemok:** Hrm....that scratch was there when we got the ship!<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  SECURITY  (4)]

**Throk:** No no...white dot next to green dot by cloudy thing!<br />
*Throk points at specific spot.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is there a way to shift our position so the Cardassian patrol catches sight of them?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): Holy crap on the rolls for Throk today.</font><br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well if they're in our warp shadow, we could drop out of warp and they'd show up on regular sensors<br />
**Ishemok:** Brilliant thinking!<br />
**Throk:** Throk recommend slamming on breaks.<br />
*Throk checks life insurance policy.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Think the Cardassians would go after them? <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is there a more subtle way of doing this? Reverse flux modulating their counter-warp frequency, so they don't get the idea they have been noticed?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You can't catcha mouse if it knows you are looking for it.<br />
**Throk:** Throk think that brilliant idea that maybe Skig do. Throk not Skig, but Throk willing to try by chewing on power cables.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Or a mongoose for that matter, little bastages!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We could try, if you've got something in mind<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I've never seen a ship try a maneuver like this<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** The region where a ship could remain hidden in a warp bubble is tiny, it would only work for very small craft<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** T'kor, you want to put all those years bumming in lower decks to use?<br />
**T'Kor:** Let me see if I can arrange this, it will be just like the crackling of Old Faithless!<br />
**T'Kor: [ DARING  (9) +  ENGINEERING  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 13]**<br />
**T'Kor:** This will probably be temporary<br />
>T'Kor rigs up the warp engines to emit a baryon pulse that should light up anything in the transpor's warp shadow.<br />

>When he activates it, a small shuttlecraft, probably not suitable for more than 1 person, is seen shadowing the transport<br />

>Malat tries to lock the transporter onto the occupant of the craft, but is unable to get a pattern lock<br />

>A moment later, the comm panel chimes to indicate you are being hailed<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hail Noble Space Remora.<br />
**Cardassian Woman:** My ship alerted me to a transporter attempt, I am not very knowledgeable about such things but I believe that transport while at warp is highly dangerous<br />
**Cardassian Woman:** If you wish to talk, we could drop to impulse and I would be more than happy to beam over<br />
**Throk:** No, very safe. Recommend you let us try again.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that's unusually civil<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh wow. Such a reasonable hitchhiker! Drop to Impulse! <br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  CONN  (1)]

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 17]**<br />
*Throk readies Disruptor Pistol to shoot the person who is is civil via comms but shows up in Mk 3 Tactical Dreadnought Armor and a Force Glaive.*<br />
*T'Kor readies his tsunkatse skills*<br />
>The transport drops out of warp and the shuttle pulls up alongside. Moments later, a tall, thin Cardassian woman wearing civilian clothes beams aboard and immediately takes a seat in the rear of the passenger compartment<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hello, would you like something to drink? <br />
*Zox has an innate dislike for warm-blooded sneaky things, but is curious.*<br />
**Cardassian Woman:** Oh that would be just lovely, a glass of Kanar would be most appreciated<br />
*Hailey Murry retrieves a glass of Kanar for the woman and some tea for herself*<br />
**Throk:** Throk take care of this.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Throk, you want something to drink?<br />
**Cardassian Woman:** Oh my, what a big strapping young man<br />
*Throk walks over to Replicator and orders up the distilled, ground remains of a Gorn Kanar Beast to be injected into a glass bottle.*<br />

>The woman is well dressed, wearing a neatly pressed blouse and a sharp pair of trousers. Her hair is pulled back into a pony tail. Her appearance is... basically pretty normal for a Cardassian civilian<br />

>T'Kor taps some keys on his engineering console.<br />

**Computer Voice:** Signal jamming field activated.<br />
**Ishemok:** So, what circumstances cause someone to hitchhike from craft to craft? Are you a dashing free-lance reporter?<br />
**Cardassian Woman:** Oh where are my manners? I forgot to introduce myself<br />
**Throk:** I go first, I Throk.<br />
**Talak:** Talak. I sell life insurance<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can you tell us more about low, low rates?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That sounds like an exciting sort of desk job. Are you out here on business? <br />
*Throk hands her a 3 gallon glass drum stuffed with the gruesome remains of what looks like a herd animal shoved through a blender.*<br />
**Talak:** Oh yes, if you want to make money in this business you have to seek out people with dangerous lifestyles<br />
**Throk:** One glass of Kanar.<br />
*Zox Lets out a hearty laugh. *<br />
>ignores Throk politely<br />

*Talak ignores Throk politely*<br />
**Talak:** Like Orion Syndicate gangsters, or Starfleet officers<br />
**Talak:** Both very lucrative audiences<br />
**Talak:** Always getting themselves into trouble<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Interesting. <br />
**Throk:** Throk have witty comment, but Throk forget which group he is.<br />
**Talak:** For example: I've just come from Bajor where the big news is that a group of Starfleet officers detonated some kind of thermonuclear device. Can you imagine!<br />
**Talak:** And I bet Starfleet doesn't even supply them with life insurance<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What? I thought the war was over?! or did they need another one for another series?<br />
**Throk:** Throk happen to know Starfleet Dental Insurance involve being beamed into new version of yourself through horrible cloning system called "transporter buffer." Throk very terrified of Starfleet Insurance system.<br />
**Throk:** However, Throk also know Orion Syndicate offer great dental insurance, for instance, you get all replacement teeth by beating them out of people who not pay protection money.<br />

*Throk wonders why Zox is using a Tricoder emblazoned PROPERTY OF STARFLEET while looking up information on their visitor.*<br />
**Talak:** So what brings you motley assortment out here?<br />
**Talak:** Leading a dangerous lifestyle, in dire need of life insurance?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, we are trying to source rare and exotic spices for our culinary treats!<br />
**Throk:** Throk move heavy objects.<br />
*Throk does not have a cover story, no one told him to think of one.*<br />
**Talak:** Rare and exotic? Then you should check out the market on Empok Nor<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We have heard of something to add a little, zip and pop, beyond the normal..yes that!<br />
**Talak:** They sell anything you can imagine there. Most rare, and very exotic<br />
**Talak:** And extremely dangerous<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You seem familiar, can you tell us a bit more? Got a lot of customers there?<br />
**Talak:** The sort of place you don't want to go without a good life insurance policy, lest you regret it<br />
**Talak:** Oh yes, many customers there<br />
**Talak:** It is the sort of pace that attracts exactly the high-risk lifestyles that allow you to charge the highest premiums<br />

**T'Kor:** (delete that)<br />
*Talak samples Zox's dessert happily as well*<br />
**Talak:** Mmm, do I taste a hint of Red Dalalak in this pudding?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Alas, madame, ve seek perfect'shion. And ve must get ze spice.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, you know it too vell.<br />
**Talak:** Normally you don't taste it outside of Cardassia, most other planets don't bother growing it because of its effects on non-Cardassians<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Perhaps, madame knows the best merchants for us? <br />
*Throk puts down in notes, "Security Chief must also be excellent cook".*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, but we have studied ze books extensively, a good dish must e'voke memoriez<br />
**Talak:** Oh most certainly, I think you'd be most interested in a businesswoman named "Jasanis" and her business partners<br />
**Talak:** She sells some.. very rare spices<br />
**Talak:** As rare as they come, and her customers are very discerning and have very particular tastes when it comes to their food<br />
**Throk:** Throk not following translator correctly, did you say "spices" or "species"?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You must 'ave learn meny things. Does this, Jasanis, have a favorite dish?<br />
**Talak:** You know I can't recall the name, but it has a very expensive white sauce<br />
**Throk:** Duracell White?<br />
**Talak:** That sounds right, perhaps that was it<br />
**Talak:** Well it's been nice to chat, but I'd better be on my way<br />
**Talak:** I have appointments to keep<br />
**Talak:** Oh wait, before I leave<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Ah, you are always welcome here.<br />
*Talak tosses a Cardassian isolinear rod to Zox*<br />
**Talak:** If you're going to the market at Empok Nor, you'll need a docking clearance or they'll vaporize you<br />
**Talak:** Strictly invitation only<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oh! Madame! You have saved us!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We are indebted to you!<br />
**Throk:** Throk question, this also work at Nok Empor? That were we are going.<br />
*Zox lets out the wootle of friendship*<br />
*Talak 's demeaner changes completely, to a much more serious tone and her face goes almost completely blank*<br />
**Talak:** No need. But when you return to your starship, tell your commander that I consider my debt to her repaid.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): Throk hums "The Gambler" by Kenny Rogers.</font><br />
*Talak activates a transporter and beams out*<br />
*Zox looks shocked.*<br />
*Ishemok electronic gasp*<br />
**T'Kor:** Do you think she was a friend of Skig? Skig does not have many friends<br />
>The shuttle turns tail and jumps directly to high warp, far faster than your transport can match<br />

*Ishemok looks to Malat.*<br />
*Zox looks to Malat.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, I think our situation is a little more complex now.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** That gave a lot of information, and some helpful invitations<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Well at least we don't need to worry about a cover story to dock at the station<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But I think we're probably gointg to need some significantly better disguises<br />
**Throk:** Throk suggest Murry wear Voth body suit.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well that's true, Everyone get some cooking clothes on.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Or a detour back to the Lister to switch out for other members<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Too tricky to get into and out of Cardassian space.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Not worth the risk<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Jasanis already knows we're onto her, if we detour all the way back she'll be long gone<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Assuming she isn't already<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, I think it's a good idea to see if we can go ruin her day either way<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's less about personal vendetta. Having pull over a commanding officer is a threat to Starfleet.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It sounded like it was the other way around<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But it's not mutually exclusive.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She said she considers her debt to the Commander repaid<br />
**Throk:** Throk once have pull over Captain Baras. He get caught in sweater with strange arms and Throk recommend button shirt instead of pullover.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Unduly influencing an officer, tsk tsk<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The only ones allowed to blackmail starfleet officers are *superior* starfleet officers.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Perhaps we are not in the best position to chastize other officers given that we are here in violation of direct orders<br />
*Zox blinks and thinks about what he has said.*<br />
*Zox looks at 11 and 10.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk also suggest larger size pockets. Throk read Admiral Picard memoir about No-Pocket-Sucks uniforms.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Your stage-chef names are Sweet and Sour.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Aye sir<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm really wondering how much Bachar already knew about all of this. I feel like we're getting entangled in something that she has a good understanding of and isn't touching for whatever reason<br />
*Zox looks to T'Kor*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Sizzlin Sauce<br />
**Throk:** Throk 100% in agreement with Murry, after all, Bachar told all officers here not to get involved.<br />
*Kosal Oram wakes up from his nap and comes out of the sleeping compartment*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No one, not even hardened criminals who would kill their 'mates for a peice of eight, can't appreciate good cooking.<br />
**Throk:** Bachar likely expecting gruesome dismemberment or rescue necessary.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** You might be right<br />
*Throk replicates up some more Bajoran Scout Cookies.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm with Zox, I think the chef thing is our best bet<br />
*Throk is waiting for a glorious suggestion.*<br />
*Throk is STILL waiting for a glorious suggestion.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I strongly suspect that they don't actually have chefs' ingredients there<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I mean, it's not like we could pass for mercenaries or hired killers<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** If I had money, no idea where Ishemok put it, I'd bet that Bachar lacks the heart to bad things to Jasanis for something that happened in the past.<br />
**Throk:** Throk remind everyone that some species consider other species edible.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yeah, not like anyone here has a body count or anything<br />

**T'Kor:** I don't know if I want to be used to cook other carbon-based life forms. <br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's better than Cookies.<br />
**Throk:** How about we only cook bad people?<br />
**T'Kor:** All people are good at some things<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's what phasers are for.<br />
**Throk:** Yes, some people are good at being cookeid.<br />
**Throk:** cookied?<br />
**Throk:** Throk like idea of turning people into baked cookies.<br />
*Throk puts down "sugar" on grocery list.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The safer story is hallucinogenic foods.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That way we don't actually commit a crime in the Federations name<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Which is also why we are going to a viper nest full of drugs<br />
*Throk laughs.*<br />
**Throk:** Throk suspect Federation has enough crimes done in its name.<br />
**Throk:** For instance, Federation mass genocide of Horta eggs.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, we've got a cover story. What's the actual game plan?<br />
*Throk looks at grocery list.*<br />
**Throk:** Step 1: Buy sugar.<br />
**Throk:** Step 2: Shoot Jasanis with Disruptor pistol<br />
**Throk:** Step 3: <blank><br />
**Throk:** Step 4: Return to station and pretend nothing happened.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I think shoot Jasanis should be step 1<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Get there. Shop around. Have Ishemok set up an exchange off planet in better circumstances where we can sting operation Jasanis.<br />
**Throk:** Throk willing to be flexible and agree with Malat.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We are only there to sample and set up a contract<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Aye sir<br />
*Lt. Malat looks a bit dissapointed*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Then the real heist begins when we have them out manned and out gunned.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well Lt. you didn't want this to be a suicide mission, did you?<br />
**Throk:** Throk point out, no human males here.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are inclined to agree with Commander Zox, far too dangerous to directly confront the cartel in their own station<br />
**Throk:** Already have them out reptiled. Should just go with option we have.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Throk you are correct. <br />
*Throk pauses.*<br />

>EXTERIOR - Space: Malat brings the transport into the docking area of Empok Nor. The station is of the same construction as Deep Space Nine, but it has been partly salvaged and several of the docking pylons are missing. The promenade has been extended with numerous modules extending out from its central core, each one seemingly haphazardly welded in with no thought to what was nearby. <br />

>The docking clearance from Talak seems to have been on-the-level, as no one has opened fire. The station is buzzing with activity, dozens of ships are docking, undocking, jumping to warp, etc. The docking area seems to have no traffic control in place, it's a chaotic free-for-all<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait a second, how do we know you're actually docking authority? <br />
**Docking Attendant:** This is a standard docking billing agreement. If you are unable to pay docking fees upfront you can pay at departure, with a 15% interest rate per week. On a failure to repay docking fees, you agree to the repossession of your ship, your personal effects, or your organs, as required to cover your accumulated docking charges<br />
