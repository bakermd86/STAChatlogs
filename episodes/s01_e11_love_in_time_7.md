>INTERIOR - Orlana Corridors: As a seemingly endless number of Tribbles pour out of every vent, light fixture, access panel, and ODN junction: Commander Bachar leads the away team at a brisk pace away from the staff quarters and back towards the labs to deal with the situation before it gets any worse.<br />

>Skig and Murry are able to keep up without any issue, but Zox, Viraset and Dr. Gallego are struggling to put their clothes back on while trying to follow the increasingly unamused executive officer. At least it is easier to pull your pants on when your legs are greased up in baby oil.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Viraseti, you and your husband had better have something useful to suggest.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** While we were practicing the reverse Plek'ta maneuver with Zox, I was thinking back to when we were younger. 20 years ago, rubbing our bodies together like this would enflame our passions and ignite our lust and... well, nevermind. You get the picture.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** But now, nothing at all. The flame of passion has long been extinguished. It gave me an idea: Camilo said the Tribble reproduction is mediated by a hormone they produce, the flame of their passion if you will. What we need to do is douse it. Commander Zox and I may be able to design a chemical weapon that can flood their hormone receptors and prevent any further uptake, thereby interrupting their mating cycle. If we are lucky, it won't even be dangerously toxic to humanoids.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Like Lisa, I aslo found my mind wandering during our workout. I too recalled our salad days of unbridled passion in our youth, and how the ravages of time have ruined our once young and supple bodies. It got me thinking about how Lisa was once young and fertile, but is no longer. That is when I realized that fertility is the key to our predicament.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Tribbles are highly unusual among macroscopic animal species, reproducing asexually and introducing genetic diversity into their population through horizontal gene transfer. This unusual mechanism means that they will be susceptible to the introduction of harmful genes during reproduction. We don't want to kill off the population, but if we can introduce a gene that will reduce their level of fertility, it should allow the population to stabilize before further damage is done.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** "No longer young and fertile" huh? As if you're still a young, strapping specimen. Maybe you can stop them mating by giving them Tribble erectile disfunction. <br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Or perhaps you can get them to fight amongst themselves by triggering their delicate sense of self worth.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Your emotional state is as unstable has a thin shell of rock covering a roiling caldera of magma. <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Enough, both of you, please<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** And you are as petty and selfish as a child, but actually that isn't a bad idea. The facility is built with geo-thermal power<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** The cave system where the tribbles are congregating is a series of old magma tubes over a now-dormant caldera. But just a few hundred meters under the surface are tens of thousands of tons of molten rock. If we equip Zox and T'Kor with a laser mining rig, and then retreat to a safe distance, they should be able to deal with the tribble problem in no time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I like ALL of these solutions!<br />
*Zox leaves grease stains on every panel he comes into contact with. *<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** Perhaps you can drive the tribbles away by condescendingly belittling their life's work and career.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** We can try. Maybe you can get rid of them by taking a new job in another sector and leaving.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Ok, that's enough of that<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** This is a golden opportunity for both of you, to become the biologist-alpha for saving the planet of ecological treasures, and the science officer-alpha of your tribe for clearing the ship.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Time to act like professionals. What's the play here? We need to make a call quickly<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Assign us Commander. One team for Team Lava, one team for Gene Engineering and one team for De-horny Chemical team?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I think the hormone or genetic approaches would be best, ideally we can come up with something that can be used without enormous amounts of collateral damage<br />
**Gra'lan:** I think Gra'lan has submitted some research in these areas as well<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** I don't think we should divide our focus Zox, we have limited time. We need all-hands on deck to stop the runaway breeding<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** While both the hormone suppression or genetic modification offer a non-engineering solution, I think the hormone suppression is a safer solution.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** And we can leave the lava as plan B<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The genetic modification prompts too much risk for an immediate fix. I would propsoe an immediate hormone suppression therapy and then a more controlled and studied approach to the long term genetic fix.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I am somewhat opposed to the idea of the lava-tube with Zox because it places my lovingly crafted Zox Exo-suit in danger.<br />
*Commander Bachar wires into the comms to make a PA*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Attention all hands: this is Commander Bachar, retreat to the higher levels of the facility until further notice. We will be addressing the Tribble problem shortly<br />

**Geret:** I got it! The tribbles have absolutely zero subtlety, their evolutionary strategy is simply to overwhelm any predators, so this makes it easier to formulate a counter-chemical.<br />
