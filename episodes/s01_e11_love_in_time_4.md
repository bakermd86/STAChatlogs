>Commander Bachar stands in the doorway, narrowing her eyes at Lt. Commanders Skig and Viraseti like a hungry Vulture in search of its next meal.

>A pair of security officers are holding Skig and Viraseti on opposite ends of the room. Skig has the remains of a plate of bolognaise smashed across her back, with the rest smeared into the carpet near her feet. Dr. Zerra is running dermal regenerator across an open contusion on Skig's appendix.

>On the other side of the room, Viraseti's uniform jacket has been stained by a carafe of Vodka Redbull, and she has taken it off and laid it over the back of a dining chair to dry. She is leaning against the wall and pressing an ice pack to her calcaneus.

>Commander Bachar steps through the doorway and into the room, stepping over the remnants of a destroyed pool table spread across the middle of the room.<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** You two had better have a good explanation for this<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The stress of being in the proximity of her estranged husband, along with physical exercise caused Viraseit to have a lapse in judgement concerning whether it was appropriate to attack a superior officer or not.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I have no idea what happened ma'am, I was just completely overcome with rage. Nothing like it has ever happened before ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Totally understandable, I think we can let this go as a stress event.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** And what about you Lt. Commander? What are you doing having candlelit dinners with a civilian in the middle of responding to an emergency situation?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Unless the rolls were really jacked up, Skig would have flattened Viraseti if we rolled for this.</font><br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Candlelit?<br />
*Skig looks at the remains of the table.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** The facility's life support system is failing and poisoning dozens of people, and you are in here drinking... whatever this disgusting liquid is on Viraseti's coat<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh yes, that was suggested as a power conservation mechanism as there is a flux power shortage in the life support system.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes yes.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I suppose I should go take a look at that. Have you tried the Tribble Souffle?<br />
*Skig offers Bachar a Tribble Kebob.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Gra'lan accidentally made about a thousand of these earlier.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It may not be their fault, I'm reading some extreme fluctuations in their neuro-transmitter levels<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh?<br />
*Gra'lan is proud of his 'accident'. Tribbles are more cost efficient at fault detection than electrical equipment.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Far beyond the normal variation for Humans or Tellarites<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That does explain my strange desire to engage in Karaoke. I guess that wll go on the Blooper Reel instead of being in the episode, as I'm sure the Dr will fix this before it gets out of hand.<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Tellerite*</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** In fact, I'm reading the same neurotranmitter fluctuations in the entire away team<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Have any of you experienced any other symptoms?<br />
*Dr. Zerra looks to Gra'lan and Oakadan*<br />
**Gra'lan:** No Sir. Steady as always.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, to be fair, I tried to actually pay attention to some personal matter Viraseti was having and even sat down and drank coffee with her.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Well that is a very troubling symptom<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That should have been an indication there were serious problems with the atmospheric controls.<br />
**Oakadan:** Hmmmm... I did have a few moments of protective concern when Lt Virasetti and I were out gathering data which struck me as unusual, but nothing so extreme as to act on it. <br />
**Gra'lan:** Perhaps we should contact security and see if random tussles have been increasing in frequency?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'll need to consult the medical database, see what could be the cause<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Much like addiction Oakadan, it builds gradually over time.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Good thinking ensign<br />
*Skig looks at Dr Zerra.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Apologies, Junior Lieutenant<br />
**Gra'lan:** No need to apologize Commander.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Good thing we are visiting a completely functional colony of scientists with a well-stocked medical bay and access to Starfleet records so we can easily identify the problem.<br />
**Gra'lan:** Now let's get these hot-bloods something that will make 'em a lil more peaceful no?<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Dr. Zerra can worry about that<br />
**Gra'lan:** Don't need a doctor to find something to mellow someone out.<br />

**Gra'lan:** They aren't specced to deal with Tribble hormones, operating within parameters. It's the ecosystem that is whacked, not the processors.<br />

**Yalak:** Our mechanicals are located in a cavern beneath the facility, near our geothermal generator<br />
**Yalak:** The entrance is on the east side of the compound<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent, lead on good sir.<br />
**Yalak:** Oh no... I don't like it down there, it's dark and scary<br />
*Skig sets phaser to wide-beam-Tribble-cooking.*<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** It's ok, I can go with them<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** I'm rogueish and handsome<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Shut up Camilo<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti takes out her phaser*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't worry, I will hold your hand, you just hold this large glowing lantern that absolutely will NOT make you the immediate target.<br />
*Skig hands Yalak a large bullseye lantern with a target on it.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Engineering TEAM assemble!<br />

>INTERIOR - Orlana sub-sub-basement: Skig and her away team, along with Dr. Gallego, descend a set of stairs into the natural cavern where the research facility's geothermal power system is located. The emergency lighting system appears to be offline, so only a small amount of natural light spils in through the open cavern door.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So wait... the colony has power and is functioning within normal parameters BUT somehow both main lighting and emergency lighting are broken in the sub-sub-basement?<br />
*Skig looks directly at the writer.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Seriously?<br />
*Dr. Gallego holds up a wire running to an emergency light, it has been chewed through*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Uh huh.<br />
*Dr. Gallego hangs a lantern on it, for lighting*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Next we will have a snowstorm...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No wait... it will be Tribble Dandruff falling from the ceiling from the thousands of them up there molting!<br />
*Skig waits for Kolea to show up with the shampoo product placement and gets annoyed when it does not happen.*<br />
**Gra'lan:** Strange things happen on this planet; strictly don't ask, don't tell.<br />
**Mowus:** Is it unusual to not be able to see tribbles down here?<br />
*Skig switches her tricoder to detect variances in the atmospheric quality as well as acting like a motion tracker from Aliens.*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In any case.<br />
**Dr. Gallego:** We should have a look<br />
**Gra'lan:** Is this yer first mine? Naw, what we should do is get some ventillation to this place before one spark ends us all.<br />
*Skig takes the wire Gallego pointed to for the emergency light and runs a reverse tester against to see if there are further breaks in the line or if it is unbroken back to the power source.*<br />

**Gra'lan:** Doctor Gallego; no fungus or archea or some special biological thingy can metabolize that Ethyl Bromide? Scratch that encyclopedic brain!<br />

>Gra'lan is now fully wedged into the wall, unable to turn back he has no choice but to attempt to continue on through<br />

**Mowus:** There's a sea of tribbles over here. I'm waist deep<br />
**Mowus:** They seem to be swarming the geo-thermal generator<br />
**Gra'lan:** But why?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Do they know the humans are trying to exerminate them, and are trying to destroy them? Or did someone program them to do this?<br />
**Mowus:** Is there a way to turn off the generator?<br />
**Gra'lan:** Im guessing we don't want to turn off this much power, it would upset many people<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I agree, also why would a bunch of Tribbles even be aware of the generator's power output?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Why would they be attracted to electricity?<br />
**Mowus:** They're attracted to something<br />
**Gra'lan:** Maybe they have been conditioned in some way.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** You're attracted to something... Why do you keep staring at Skig?<br />
**Gra'lan:** no one really pays attention to the 'do not feed the animals' signs<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I doubt the are intelligent enough to understand, most likely they are attracted to the sound, vibration, or heat. In all likelihood we could replicate a similar pattern and move the Tribbles out of the area.<br />

**Gra'lan:** and it just happens to be the largest metallic thing aboot<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, let's see if we can determine what they are attracted to and move them.<br />

>As Skig and her team discuss their options, Dr. Gallego suddenly wakes up and squirms free from Viraseti, reaching out to Skig to help him down. In the confusion, they lose their footing and fall on the slippery, steep cave floor. The three of them star sliding down the mossy, damp ground and take out Mowus' legs, and all four careen down the steep slope like a big Tribble waterslide, into the green pool below.

Gra'lan kneels down and reaches out to try to help them, but slips off the ledge and falls face first into the pool as well.<br />
