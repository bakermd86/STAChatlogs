>INTERIOR - Temple of the Keepers of the Flame: Geret's phaser begins to whine louder and louder as the power cell glows red with the growing energy of the phaser overload she inadvertently triggered.<br />

**Geret:** Quick! Skig! It's gonna explode! Fix it now!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** If allowed to overload at that power level, I estimate that the blast will vaporize most of the town.<br />
**Geret:** I know Skig can fix anything!<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I certainly hope so, I was not looking to be vaporized<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti gives Geret a dirty look*<br />
*Skig is upstairs and not aware of whatever the heck is going on downstairs.*<br />

>Geret pushes through the pain, suffering painful second degree burns on her hands but she manages to dump the phaser's power cell into the emitter, dissipating the overload into a phaser blast directed at the wall of flame, as she had originally intended to do<br />

*Skig marks down, "makes unapproved modifications to Starfleet equipment" for her AAR.*<br />

**Geret:** If you wish to live among, or observe these primitives, we have no issue with that, but they are weak creatures of flesh, and cannot take weak, minty fresh radiation.<br />
*Geret makes friendly gestures towards Drone*<br />
>Once the phaser is completely dead, the device simply turns around and flies back through the wall of flame<br />

**Geret:** ....well that's that, there cannot be a peace.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm more inclined to suspect the caretakers died, things are short-circuited, and the recording systems are still running.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, can you exame the phaser and see if its current state matches what was observed on Old Faithless to see if the same technology is responsible for rendering the shuttlecraft inert?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): If Skig can't roll dice worth a damn, she will delegate!</font><br />

**Skig:  [d20 = 1]**<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** Fascinating.. The energy cell has been completely drained, it certainly bears a resemblance to what happened to the shuttle. <br />
**Geret:** So what you are saying is, this strange computer system is an energy vampire desperately trying to rejuvinate itself!<br />
**Geret:** and it with gorge itself on any and all sources of energy<br />
**Geret:** Well, I hope it doesnt' think T'kor is a reactor rod.<br />
*Skig hands Geret some Chinese Handcuffs to keep her busy.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti, would you suppose the fuel has been rendered inert, drained, or the actual feed mechanisms for the power systems have been destroyed?<br />

**Geret:** Mmm Delicious energy!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Fascinating. On the shuttlecraft did we observe something similar on with the Dilithium Crystals?<br />
**T'Kor:** So it appears there's a cave in downstairs. The fire there doesn't seem hot enough to register to my suit's readings, so I could slip past it, and the cave-in downstairs doesn't seem to be covering any other stairs<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Thanks T'Kor, what was on the other side of the fire downstairs? Or did you not pass it yet?<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** It is similar to what happened to the shuttle's hydrogen and antimatter fuel, it was also rendered non-fusable.<br />
**T'Kor:** A forcefield<br />
**T'Kor:** Though there is also a teleportation pad<br />
**Geret:** Is it powered?<br />
**T'Kor:** Actually, do you think we could hack into it remotely? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, thank you Viraseti for the correction, the writer who types my lines for these shows frequently has no idea what he is talking about.<br />

**Geret:** Bawwww<br />
**T'Kor:** My kind are actually made of a crystaline silica, we "ingest" different compounds and crystals at regular intervals<br />
**Geret:** Are semi-conductors then, semi-delicious?<br />
**T'Kor:** It is less convenient than your body's propensity to store energy around the waist and thighs<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti considers shooting Geret for that pun*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Interesting, that button actually means "Drone Deactivation Initiate" and not "Drone Self Procreation Process"<br />
*Skig is disappointed her plans for a Drone Army are delayed.*<br />
**T'Kor:** I thought it read "Drone Self Destruct Procreation Process" and was both confused and alarmed<br />
**Geret:** The visual effect should be enough<br />
**Geret:** The locals are 100% spooked.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Viraseti and Zerra, can you both work on isolating and determining how to neutralize the source of radiation?<br />
**Geret:** Plus, you could command them to bring us refreshments, and we could more easily recieve them.<br />
**Geret:** The radiation is now cinnamon; it eminates from directly below our location.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** T'Kor, can you run a diagnostics on this system to see if we can identify what caused any irregularities in the system. Possibly earthquake or whatever caused these cave-ins?<br />

![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** I don't think any of these product placements have been approved by the network<br />
**T'Kor:** It does appear that ther's some damage to the reactor core. It's in a subdued state to minimize strain on the system. <br />
**Geret:** Can we....take all the spicy materials and throw it into the Old Faithful's reactor? These natives can live in peace then.<br />
**Geret:** If there's a transporter room nearby, which there is, we might be able to beam it into our shuttle directly<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Is that what has been leaking radiation? And do we have the ability to repair it in a way that is not harmful to the natives, yet disables the fuel neutralization process?<br />
**Geret:** It doesn't look like natives here appreciate the full spectrum of radiological flavors...I think they only understand bad things.<br />
**T'Kor:** In order to determine that, we'll need to investigate the reactor itself<br />
**Geret:** Down we go!<br />
**Geret:** Wheee!<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ensign, I am medically concerned about your tendency to describe readiation as a flavor<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I want to run a neurolgical scan on you when we get back to the Lister<br />
**Geret:** You should try a ghost pepper. You will suddenly see there is no difference between radiation burns and flavor country.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To keep the radiation level constant, we need to turn off the forcefield.<br />
**T'Kor:** Excuse me, but what is a... "cultural assimilation center"?<br />
**Geret:** You're the god here.<br />
**Geret:** How can Nanon, the keeper of the 7 flames, lord of all creation, not know?<br />
**T'Kor:** Ensign Geret, I think you may forget yourself. I am T'kor, an engineer on the Lister<br />
**T'Kor:  [Total: 0] [Effects: 0] [dChallenge = 0]**<br />
**Geret:** Your claims of god-hood are better documented than your claims of being on the Lister.<br />
*Geret shrugs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Where do you see "Cultural Assimilation Center"?<br />
**T'Kor:** Right here, it's part of the designation of this facility<br />
*T'Kor points at the large, blocky letters at the top of the screen, above the menus*<br />
>As Skig activates the transporter system, a rumble of stone on stone is heard from the main chamber. The heavy stone stairs pivot upwards, blocking the access from above and revealing a transporter pad hidden underneath<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...observation center or assimilation center?<br />
**Geret:** OOh! creepy!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Assimilation could have quite some negative connotations without knowing exactly what they are doing.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Before anyone transports...<br />
**Geret:** Oh no. Don't read the warning labels, that's no fun!<br />
*Skig checks the Transporter logs for (a) things in the buffer (b) list of transport locations.*<br />
**Geret:** Oh....Okay that's smart! Skig's the best!<br />
>The transporter buffer is empty, and the access logs indicate several tranports to/from a ship in orbit around 40 years ago, as well as a handful of site-to-site tranports between the two transporter pads in the temple<br />

**T'Kor:** It looks like this facility has been checked and maintained regularly for centuries. Every 20-50 years, <br />
**Geret:** until recently.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So the last check in was 40 years ago, and the damage happened about 10 years ago.<br />
**T'Kor:** They had mentioned things began to go wrong about 13 years ago<br />
**Geret:** Who are they though?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Let's get the reactor stable and not-leaking, reactivate the forcefield, and then find the answer to that question.<br />
**Geret:** IS there really a race of spider people like that statue? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Possibly.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** So who are you volunteering to beam into a reactor room full of radiation from an unknown source?<br />
**T'Kor:** Let us investigate<br />
**Geret:** Why don't you just check your web-browser? That tends to find spiders real quick!<br />
**Geret:** Oh! I'll go! It's Picante Flavor!<br />
**T'Kor:** You can beam me in to investigate, I'll run a scan for the strength and you can beam me out if I don't tell you it's okay<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Although, for the record, on Paktor Beta VII, the Preservers used a statue of a hairy bull with a prehensile tongue as a marker, and that is not at all what they looked like.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Excellent T'Kor, now I don't have to Voluntold you.<br />
*Skig beams T'Kor into scary radiation room.*<br />
*Geret looks deflated.*<br />
*Skig stabs her with a pin to let more air out.*<br />
>T'Kor dematerializes from the transporter pad and rematerializes on a small transporter pad next to a huge open room. The floor of the large room is at least 40 meters down, and in the center of the room is a small black dot surrounded by a swirling mass of energy and debris.<br />

**T'Kor:** Oh<br />
**T'Kor:** This is <br />
>T'Kor immediately recognizes the reactor as being an artificial quantum singularity, like those used by the Romulans to power their ships<br />

**T'Kor:** This is definitely a Romulan-style artificial singularity. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Interesting, the documentation and control surfaces are not Romulan though.<br />
**Geret:** Whew, at least it's not a Carthaginian-style one<br />
>As he scans the reactor, T'Kor suddenly feels the tug of an unstable spacial distortion cast off from the roiling, unshielded reactor core. He begins to be pulled off the platform, but is just able to grab on to a guard rail before falling into the deep pit beneath. He is left dangling from the rail over a 40 meter drop, being pelted by debris caught in the distortions from the reactor<br />
