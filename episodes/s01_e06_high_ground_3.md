>INTERIOR - Bridge: The Lister rocks violetly as the emergency lighting kicks in and the Red Alert klaxon begins to blare momentarily before they fall silent as main power fails. As the rocking subsides, the only sound is the crackle of burning EPS conduits, as the acrid smell of melting polymers and burnt hair fill the bridge<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Damage report!<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Controls are completely dead, I don't even have navigational sensors.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Sensors are completely offline, the main ODN sensor uplink appears to be severed.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Weapons, Shields, Targeting, Communications, and social media all down!<br />
>Commander Bachar grabs a fire extinguisher and starts putting out plasma fires around the bridge.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Based on the output from my console, I would say we are somewhere between, "completely helpless" and "dead in the next 10 minutes".<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Dead in 10 minutes doesn't work me, I have plans later<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Step one will be to drop bulkheads as appropriate to avoid further venting of atmosphere, allocate EVA suits to appropriate engineering teams, and have medical teams identify and triage as appropriate.<br />
**Kurij:** Engine console is down, but I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be moving until we get a good diagnostics<br />

>INTERIOR - Fire Control: As Zox pries open the doors to the fire control room, the wave of heat nearly knocks them off their feet. Gravity in the room appears to be offline, as the furniture is being churned around through the air. And tn the center of the room, a large ball of electro plasma is burning brightly, suspended in the zero-g environment and being fed by an EPS conduit rupture on the ceiling<br />

**Kurij:** Uh oh<br />
**J'Davir:** I believe I have spotted something suspicious.<br />
*J'Davir points at the ball of electro-plasma.*<br />

**Kurij:** The standard procedure for zero-G plasma fires are simultaneous extinguishing from at least 3 positions at 60 degree increments. It's key to approach slowly until the plasma cools enough to condense back into hydrogen gas. At that point, we avoid sparks as best we can until we can suck it up again<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Mowus, see if the Twins can get a message sent up to the Bridge. I think if we can get the armistace sent over to the Jem'Hadar, we may have improved chances of getting all of us out of here alive<br />
**Third T'kar Nar'ak:** I am Third T'Kar Nar'ak, and I swear to the Founders that if this is a deception, I will tear your limbs from your body before you die<br />
**Mowus:** But we'd also need to contact the Crazy Horse if they are still around so they do not fire on them.<br />
*Third T'kar Nar'ak cuts his palm with his blade and lets the blood drip to the deck*<br />
**Throk:** Throk offer to help in newfound spirit of cooperation.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Throk, you're forbidden from tearing off my limbs<br />
*Throk cuts palm with blade and let's drip also.*<br />
>Mowus hails the twins but gets no response<br />

**Throk:** Throk seal agreement. Now we feast?<br />
**Red Shirt (Engineering):** They should be in range<br />
**Red Shirt (Engineering):** They may need help<br />
*Red Shirt (Engineering) climbs back in the cupboard*<br />
**Throk:** Throk wonder if Jem'Hadar boarding ship can be used to transit to other broken parts of ships with hole in them?<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Why is the ship always broken?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Seriously. I try to keep things running in a 100+ year old ship and no...no...it's like the universe hates me.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Really, there are mystical RNG forces at work that just want the ship to blow up.<br />
>MEANWHILE! INTERIOR - Engineering: Skig finally gets her team to the engineering deck to investigate the main power distribution system. When she opens the door to the main EPS relay room, she sees the entire deck crackling with raw power as the ships entire electrical system seems to be discharging through the deck plates. Debris and furniture have been strewn everywhere, as the entire deck seems to have suffered heavy damage<br />

**Ishemok:** WHy haven't you figured out a way to charge by the hour?<br />
**Oakadan:** It's a good excuse for some upgrades, though<br />
**Oakadan:** It's a good thing Mowus isn't here<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Because this strikes me as a problem caused by the fact that I was trying to figure out a way to solve multiple problems at once.<br />
*Skig agrees with Oakadan.*<br />
>Skig notices the bodies of several of her engineering subordinates also strewn about the deck, burnt beyond recognition<br />

**Ishemok:** Not all water types are weak to electricity, some actually love a good shock.<br />
**Skig: [ PRESENCE  (8) +  COMMAND  (1)]
[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]
Failed on DC: 1 [2d20 = 29]**<br />
*Skig sigh.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I just had trained all them.<br />
**Ishemok:** We need more androids!<br />
