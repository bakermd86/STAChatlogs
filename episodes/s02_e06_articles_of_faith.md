>Captains Log, Stardate 62200.5: We are en route to the Pelarian System to respond to a request for engineering assistance from a Federation Anthropolgy team based there.

In the meantime, Zox has requested leave to return to his home planet to attend a funerary rite for his sister. I am somewhat concerned about the request for a pilot in case he is "incapacitated" so I have asked Kolea to accompany him as well. <br />

>INTERIOR - Shuttlecraft: Zox, Geret and Kolea arrive at the shuttlecraft that Bachar has approved for them. As they enter, they find Ghex sitting at the conn completing her preflight checks. When Zox enters she pops up and nervously half-salutes, half-waves<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Hello!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Tired of big ships?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Uhm, I saw the request for a pilot sir, and I know that there are other pilots on board and you don't really need me and stuff. I mean, any pilot can handle ferrying you back-and-forth to your planet. It's not like this is some dangerous mission or anything, and theoretically it is a bit "low-level" for the chief conn officer... But, uhm... I was hoping I could go, because I am sort of kind of responsible for your sister's death. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** If you don't mind that is. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I can also leave. I should probably leave, now that I think about it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** This was kind of maybe a pretty bad idea<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Eh, things happen.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ghex, it is okay and I think you should come with us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** It is a natural tendency to both feel guilt and want to atone for mistakes.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** It's either flying or making a fuss over the right preparations. This is more natural.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** The roar of thrusters, easy flying...what's not to love?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Ok, in that case I'll try not to get shot down and crash into a greehouse this time.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I have confidence in your flying skills, you will do fine.<br />
>As Ghex turns back to the conn to complete her preflight checks, Lt. Commander Viraseti walks into the shuttle dragging a large travel case behind her. She shoves the case into the under seat storage in the back of the shuttle and sits down reading a PADD without saying a word to anyone<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** And I'll do my best to not accidentally shapeshift into Zox's sister, because that would be very awkward for you. <br />
**Geret:  [2d20 = 22]**<br />
**Geret:  [d20 = 4]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I mean...It would end worse for you Geret. They may think you undead.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): still healthier than a horta ex</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Viraseti, packing for a long trip?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Something like that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I see.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Whatcha bringing there?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Come forth, for we shall embark upon a journey through the skies of yonder planet! <br />
*Kolea drops her "medical bag" on a shelf.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Geret is carrying a Harp and a bow and arrow<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Why do you care what's in my bag?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Dieties are predictable. I don't have to harp on their gear.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** I had G'ralan put a phaser into the bow, so it can actually shoot as long as I go through the motions!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** So you'll just have to wait<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Fair enough!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Ok, wow this shuttle trip is going to be way weirder than I was expecting<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I'm ready to leave though, everyone take your seats and prepare for departure<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** make it so!<br />
>Ghex pilots the shuttle up and out of the aft shuttle bay as Geret stows her harp and phaser bow safely under her seat<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ghex, you should have come to expect this by now.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Fun to have two RNG give us two gimmick TOS aliens.</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Brig: Skig, Hailey, Malat and some guy head to the brig to interrogate the prisoners. On the monitors, they can see Krepeka's body, McCallister, and a Cardassian in three separate cells.<br />

>Malat gestures to a junior security officer who accompanies her into the cells, and they then return with the Cardassian prisoner and sit him in the chair in the interrogation room. He does not react at all.<br />

*Skig sits down across from the Cardassian.*<br />

*Cardassian Man continues to sit silenty.*<br />

**Cardassian Man** Your foolish Federation optimism cannot undo their deaths, they may still have a handful of heartbeats, but they are dead.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): But, Darisha, Next Generation is no longer making new episodes and in syndication. Clearly we need to sell the Discovery Cyronic Technologies!</font><br />

**Crewman McAllister** It was nothing special, just simple environmental overrides and sensor bypasses. Starship systems are very complex, but that complexity means that a small change in one area can have broader consequences downstream that can make it difficult to fully secure all ship's systems<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Indeed, I have found similar issues with sensors and internal ship systems. Quite honestly, as leaky as things are, I am surprised most starships don't spend their days having ransomware removed.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** If you want my advice as a fellow engineer: securing environmental systems against tampering is an overlooked but important aspect of ship operation. Environmental systems are seen by most security officers as low-priority, but it is the one thing keeping the entire crew alive out here.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** I would recommend that you start with O2 and CO2 concetration sensors in the environmental control system. The sensor outputs are high-speed covariant signals, so they are insecure by default. But you can secure them using a narrow-band signal encrypter without any loss of throughput<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** It did take me the better part of a day to figure out how you had cross connected the logical ciruits between atmospheric controls and the replication dispensers. Excellent work, not something that I would have guessed from your profile. Seriously, I would write you a commendation for finding loopholes in environmental systems like that.<br />
**Crewman McAllister** It would make it much more difficult for anyone to puill the same trick in the future.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Noted, I will look in that suggestion along with a couple other systems.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Did your modifications extend to comms or internal sensors to adjust those as well?<br />
**Crewman McAllister** Oh, the internal sensors were no problem. Creating a blindspot on internal sensors is quite easy, it is a relatively straightforward matter to cross-couple the output from a sensor area relay back into a neighboring area, overriding its own sensor output<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Fascinating, I've found a few of those, out of curiosity, have you helped Kolea with any of her tricks? I've found a few of hers which are mildly scary. For instance, the emergency caches that don't even register properly.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I only know that he wanted me to keep the captain under control, to make sure the Lister made it to certain points.

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you recall which points we had to make it to? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** Well the main thing he wanted me to accomplish was to get Zox's mother on board. To see if she was conspiring with any members of the crew. But he also wanted to make sure we diverted to Skana IV for our repairs after the hull breaches you caused, even though there were other nearer facilities.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): surprisingly intact memories.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** The research facility on Skana IV was already researching Ketracel White and, in retrospect, that must have been chosen to facilitate Jasanis' operation.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you know what their plans for the matrix were? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I am not a biochemist, but my understanding is that Dr. Malov's procedure for refining Ketracel White uses founder morphogenic matrix as a stabilizer<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** The Founders themselves apparantly use a similar method, it is why it is so hard to obtain Ketracel White from any other source.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): So Sam was organizing all this through Jasanis. It makes the scene where the Federation officers watch "fake Jasanis" (aka Browena) melted down by a long distance sniper disruptor come around as him cleaning up tracks along the way.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Okay, so potentially they were using it to produce larger amounts of Ketracel White? <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zerra.png" alt="Dr. Zerra" width="50" height="50">**Dr. Zerra** I should warn you, after they extracted me, I ended up at a facility where Sam had me continuing work that I assume Neraran must have started<br />

>INTERIOR - Research Outpost: Skig, Oakadan, Mowus, and Windbloom beam down to the outpost. They find themselves in a dimly lit cavern, excavated into the hillside overlooking the Pelarian village. Several viewing ports are built into the walls proviing a view of Pelarian daily life.<br />

**Dr. Lázaro** Wonderful, I'm so glad you're here. Let me show you to the system.<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** We don't have any engineers on-site, just me and a few graduate students. So we were really in a pickle<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Mowus.png" alt="Mowus" width="50" height="50">**Mowus** I am so grateful for this opportunity Dr. Lazaro!<br />
*Dr. Lázaro leads the away team to a chamber where they see a small portable fusion reactor and a computer core, along with several outbound ODN junctions which presumably connect to the various holo emitters*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Oakadan.png" alt="Oakadan" width="50" height="50">**Oakadan** When did it begin to malfunction?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** A few weeks ago, around the time we excavated the viewing area for the temple<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** We thought maybe we had expanded too much, but we checked the documentation and the total area of holo coverage is well within the limits<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** That is when we decided to request Starfleet assistance<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The temple is definitely suspicious, but how does it compare with the rest of the village? Is it newer, older, different architecture?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** The temple is a relatively recent construction, based on our time here we believe that they started construction around 60 years ago<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The surrounding community is older than that?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Do similar temples exist?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** What religions have you observed? Are they monotheists or polytheists? Is this temple dedicated to a new deity or an older one?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Yes, most of the villages in the area are have existed much longer. As for other temples, they certainly have them but this one seems relatively unique<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Curious.does this village trade and communicate with other villages or are they outsiders?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Ah, their religion is fascinating. It is a polytheistic religion, and they believe that they can commune with their gods in the cave under the temple <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hmm....<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** The priestesses are said to go on vision quests in the caverns, we have been gradually moving closer to the temple itself to study their ritual practice in greater detail<br />

>EXTERIOR - Voth Colony: Ol' Faithless swoops in low over the zucchini fields and the greenhouses before landing with a *CLUNK* in a landing area near the colony. Zox, Kolea, Ghex and Geret disembark right away, Viraseti comes out a few minutes later after retrieving her large travel case from the stowage area under the cabin seats.<br />

Which is pretty strange, kind of inappropriate atire to wear to a funeral I think. I just went with a standard dress uniform because that seemed the most appropriate. It's hard to go wrong with a dress uniform because it is designed by Starfleet to be appropriate in a wide range of environments and scenarios across a variety of different cultures<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Oh no, it's a bit delicate I wouldn't want Geret to turn into a Gormagander and crush it<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Do you think it would have been more fitting to come as that Hades fellow, Ghex? I suppose I could put in the effort, but I just felt that a bit of uplifted spirits and honor could go a long ways. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Maybe you should have gone with Charon<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** I'm not sure what kind of music you play at your funerals, but I am excellent at sight reading<br />
*Zox smiles.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Mayhaps it comes from being a god of music? <br />

>Bachar and the Pelarian priestess materialize into the holodeck. All around them, they see people wearing full body inflatable costumes of strange creatures that they do not recognize: some sort of giant yellow mouse, a large pink creature of a roughly spherical shape, a bipedal winged lizard with flames on its back and tail. The strange costumed people are walking around between folding tables full of merchandise depicting the same unknown creatures.

The room is a large auditorium filled with folding chairs and with a large stage decorated in red, white and blue colors. There are thousands of red, white and blue baloons scattered all across the floor of the room, and streamers hanging from the ceiling. A large banner hangs in the distance that reads "Nixon / Ford '68"

The room is incredibly loud, as the ancient 20th century Earth song "Du Hast" blasts over loudspeakers<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I come in peace, I am merely responding to an automated distress beacon <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** It is an old beacon, but it was reactivated from standby a short while ago when it detected a power surge from a transporter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Greetings Gul Bemek, I am First Officer Skig of the USS Lister. We are here on our own mission, but for the purposes of cooperation we are happy to assist you if possible.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes, we spotted some wreckage from a crashed ship on the planet, but have not yet had the opportunity to investigate it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I am glad to hear that, because my sensor scans indicate that you may have conducted an illegal salvage operation of one of our vessels.<br />
*Skig makes hand signal to Bachar that translates to, "Vedek Dude probably wants to GTFO".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I am sure that this was merely done in error, so I am happy to simply take possession of the illegally collected salvage and you may return without hostility to Federation space.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** As you are, no doubt, aware: Under Appendix J, Section 4 of the Quinumvirate Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities agreement: all parties to the agreement have ceded exclusive salvage rights of vessels of a military nature to their original operating entities<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Curious, as we have not been near the ship in question, but if it is yours, we are happy to allow you full access to it in the spirit of cooperation. As Starfleet personnel, we were mostly concerned with the risk of cultural contamination of the Prime Directive of the local pre-space-flight culture.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The Orb currently on your vessel was taken illegally from the wreckage of a Cardassian military transport, a clear violation of the terms of the agreement.<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I am certain that you, upstanding Starfleet officers, did not intend to conduct any illegal salvage. So I am happy to simly take possession of the illegal salvage and we can happily go our separate ways.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, that does fill in a few gaps in what we have been able to determine of the native populace.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I would hate to have to find... alternative resolution, to this dispute.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think that the Jem'Hadar colony Windbloom came from would be more likely to give it to the Cardassians by default, but I think we could probably convince them otherwise to get the Orb to the Bajorans. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** T'Pau would probably wind up being the mediator, who's also not going to be swayed emotionally. I get the feeling he'd be more of a "rules as intended" fellow, rather than "rules as written"<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think the orb is definitely a legitimate salvage interest under the terms of Appendix J, because by Appendix P the Cardassians have agreed that the orbs are the righul property of Bajor, and are important spiritual artifacts to them.

However, it's important to note that we came across the Orb without even being aware that there was salvage, and when we obtained the orb it was not from the wreckage. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** This being their planet, the Pelarians found the Orb long ago. As is clear from the records and studies of their culture, it's been a part of their society for decades now. Not only are the Pelarians not signatories of the appendix, but the retrieval of the Orb happened far before the treaty was signed. <br />
*Darisha-Han takes notes as a venerable federation officer engages arguments in a dispassionate, civilized fashion.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Given that the signatories agree in Appendix P.1 that the Orbs are the rightful property of Bajor as being important spiritual artifacts, and given that this Orb was not a part of any salvage we had anything to do with, we do not believe that Appendix J.4 is relevant here.<br />
*Hailey Murry sits back down*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Thank you. In my opinion, we must first determine whether Appendix J.4 attaches to the retrieval of the orb. Gul Bemek, Commander Murry makes the argument that the orb is no longer salvage due to the Pelarians' having retrieved it long ago. This seems like a logical position. Your response.<br />

The fact that a piece of cargo was not co-located with the other wreckage does not suddenly make it not-salvage.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** And the fact that the Pelarians may have moved the orb at some point does not alter the salvage restrictions in place on the Federation. If a bird had moved it, it would still be salvage. If the wind blew it down a hill, it would still be salvage. The fact that a primitive, pre-technological race with no knowledge of space flight may have disturbed some of the wreckage is not a salvage operation. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The items which they may have moved are still active salvage, just as they would be if an animal had moved them.<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Amazingly, bronze and copper both survive far better than iron does. Viking Museum in Dublin is really cool, I highly recommend it.</font><br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Oh yes. In fact, the recent revelation that there is a crashed Cardassian vessel on the planet explains some mysteries about the Pelarians. We have observed them wearing jewelry made of advanced alloys which we were unsure how they could have made.

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** No Commander, Gul Bemek will first have the opportunity to cross examine your witness. Gul Bemek, please proceed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** If I understood your testimony correctly doctor: you have never witnessed the Pelarians moving the orb, it that correct?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** Yes, that is correct.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** And you describe the orb as having been located in a cave or cavern of some sort. Tell me, did you study the geology of this cave at all?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** No, we are anthroplogists<br />
*Skig is more curious at the line of questioning than anything else so far and stops trying to visualize flow emitters in tachyon relays to pass the time.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I see, well my vessel has taken scans of the cave since we arrived. Our anslysis suggests that the cave is consistent with an impact crater.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Given the reluctance of the Pelarians to move the orb, is it possible that they have NEVER moved the orb? That its location in the cave was the location it landed when it fell out of the vessel as it broke up in the atmosphere?<br />
**Dr. Lázaro** I suppose I can't rule that out.<br />
*Darisha-Han looks incredibly geeked about using a polaroid as evidence.*<br />
*Skig has the Lister run a scan of the cave to validate or invalidate the Cardassian's assessment.*<br />

*Skig passes a note to Murry, "It is entirely possible the Cardassians are correct and somehow it is from an impact crater...but the evidence for or against is inconclusive."*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'd like to call Vedek Ojun to testify about the Orb<br />
*Skig clearly we just need to bring the Pelarian on board and have them testify they carried the Orb back from the salvage.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Clearly we just need to bring the Pelarian on board and have them testify they carried the Orb back from the salvage.</font><br />
*Hailey Murry passes a note back to Skig, "Even if they've left it where it's fallen, it's clearly incorporated into their practices as one of their belongings."*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Before we hear from Vedek Ojun, I believe it is logical to first investigate this important question of fact which Gul Bemek has raised. If the orb crashed in this location and the Pelarians did not move it, then they could not have logically conducted a salvage operation pertinent to Appendix J.4<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): The presence of jewelry and other items would imply they had been to the wreck site.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** If this is indeed what happened, then I will have no choice but to rule in the Cardassians' favor. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I would disagree with that. Even if they have left it physically where they lay, they have clearly incorporated the Orb into their culture. Similar to if they had built a town or city around the wreckage of the ship, that would still be their salvage even if it were left where it originally fell. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** I will grant the parties a four hour recess to investigate this issue of fact. If the evidence indicates that the orb was not removed to this location by the Pelarians, then I will have to rule in favor of Gul Bemek and the Cardassian Union.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** I do not follow your logic commander: if the Pelarians never moved the orb, then they conducted no salvage. If they conducted no salvage operation, then the salvage operation began when your officer removed the orb from the location where it had landed<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** This is an imporant question of fact, one that we cannot logically ignore.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** We will reconvene in four hours, and you can present your evidence then as to the history of how the orb ended up in this location.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm sorry what was that last bit? Is there oil leaking out of it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Sirracha is considered a leathal weapon with a Gorn around. You might want to not brandish that here. =D<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** We will now resume the proceedings. Upon review of the relevant data, I believe it is logical to conclude that the Pelarians' potential removal of the orb does not constitute a salvage operation as the vessel was not in danger, nor a navigation hazard, nor a cause of environmental danger.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Are there any objections to this finding before we proceed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We posit that this does constitute salvage. The Orb itself actually emits a variety of different exotic particles and effects, not the least of which are some which were the reason we were called here to begin with. It was interfering with the holographic concealers on the research base here. This means the Orb  in particular poses an environmental hazard in that sense, but also in the effects that the visions have upon the culture and society of the Pelarians. The statute specifies that the removal of anything posing an environmental hazard will constitute a recovery operation. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** This is pure speculation. The Pelarians are primitives. They are completely unaware of any potential environmental hazards from the wreckage or the orb. Besides which it is pure speculation to suggest that the orbs constitute an environmental hazard, the Bajorans have been living in proximity to them for thousands of years. There is no evidence that they cause environmental damage.<br />
**Throk: [ CONTROL  (8) +  MEDICINE  (1)]

Failed on DC: 1 [2d20 = 31]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** That which poses an environmental risk to a Bajoran and to a Pelarian are not necessarily the same. It is not logical to invoke Bajoran history as evidence of the orb's safety here. And the provisions of the commerce agreement do not include an intent requirement, so it is thus illogical to rely on the Pelarians' knowledge of the potential environmental hazard.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk object as evolution would dictate that Bajorans have been living in proximity with orbs long enough to develop resistance to any harmful effects they emit, while Pelerians would be subjected to any adverse effect due to a deficiency in their genetic makeup which would preclude said resistance. They are different species and the argument made by the Cardassian is moot.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** In light of this argument: I find it is logical to conclude that the Pelarians' removal of objects from the site is sufficient to constitute a salvage operation. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk makes mental note to invite T'Pau over for dinner.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** In light of this: I find that the position of Commander Murry that the Pelarians have conducted a legitimate salvage operation prior to the enforcement date of the agreement to be logical. <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): (later sad to learn)</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** As such, the provisions of the quinumvirate agreement do not apply, and the standard salvage provisions must then be applied in accordance with the Federated Commerce Agreement.<br />

*Throk is so excited he accidentally dribbles Sriracha on Darisha-Han.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** The Cardassians retain ownership rights in the salvage, but they must make an appropriate renumeration to the Pelarians to be negotiated between the Pelarians and the Cardassians<br />

*Throk sniffs Sriracha on Darisha-Han and drools on her a little.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** On that topic your honor, I do not believe that any renumeration is due to the Pelarians<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Under the conditions of the commerce agreement, the Pelarians have a "duty to secure the salvaged property from damage or theft" and "If the salvor has been negligent, they may forfeit the right to claim compensation"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The Pelarians were very evidently negligent in their duty to protect the salvaged property from theft, as a junior officer aboard this vessel was able to steal it with minimal effort.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** does the agreement apply to the Pelarians at all, if they have not signed it though? (Looks to Hailey Murry )<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The successful theft of the orb by this officer proves beyond doubt that they were not able to honor their duties under these provisions, so we owe the Pelarians no renumeration for thier incompetent salvage operations.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh that's interesting, I thought the Prophets are always on Bajor? Do they hold differing opinions sometimes? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I don't know, you'll need to go stay at a monastery for a while and converse with the Vedeks if you want to get a deeper understanding of the Prophets.

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** If only they'd told me BEFORE I made the bomb<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Darisha, a big part of journalism is to know sometimes the story should NOT be told.<br />
