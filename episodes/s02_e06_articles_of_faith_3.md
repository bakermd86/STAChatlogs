>EXTERIOR - Voth Colony: Ol' Faithless swoops in low over the zucchini fields and the greenhouses before landing with a *CLUNK* in a landing area near the colony. Zox, Kolea, Ghex and Geret disembark right away, Viraseti comes out a few minutes later after retrieving her large travel case from the stowage area under the cabin seats.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Doesn't this all smell lovely!?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** A delightfully quaint village! It reminds me of yonder Rome, from the olden days!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** You need any help with that Viraseti?<br />
*Zox shudders at the concept of salting the earth.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** We have a delusional Geret with giant biceps standing around. You could put those to use.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Um, I don't think you really actually lived in ancient Rome. You just look like it for some reason. Which is pretty strange, kind of inappropriate atire to wear to a funeral I think. I just went with a standard dress uniform because that seemed the most appropriate. It's hard to go wrong with a dress uniform because it is designed by Starfleet to be appropriate in a wide range of environments and scenarios across a variety of different cultures<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Oh no, it's a bit delicate I wouldn't want Geret to turn into a Gormagander and crush it<br />
*Kolea tosses her oversized medical bag over one shoulder, taking advantage of the convienent cross-body strap.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Good point. I can help with it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Do you think it would have been more fitting to come as that Hades fellow, Ghex? I suppose I could put in the effort, but I just felt that a bit of uplifted spirits and honor could go a long ways. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Maybe you should have gone with Charon<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ghex, you are doing fine and made a good choice.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** The three headed dog? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** At least Hades had the good thought to grow pomegranites....I can't eat a harp.<br />
*Kolea is ignoring the conversation about random Greek Gods from some part of ancient Earth history that she never learned about.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Sure ensign...<br />
*Geret pulls out a little PAD, opening up a list of references that she made during her reading on the way over*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Or music. Or beauty. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** I can actually play this harp<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** I'm not sure what kind of music you play at your funerals, but I am excellent at sight reading<br />
*Zox smiles.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Mayhaps it comes from being a god of music? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Your harp is nothing compared to a nautral instrument. I will play you the dirge of my people.<br />

>As the crew make their way out of the landing area, they see a group of Voth gathered in a field outside of the center of town. They are all shirtless, and are manually digging a large hole with shovels while wootling a sad funerary wootle.<br />

*Geret caves in after about a minute and begins playing more of an accompanyment to Zox's tooting*<br />
>Zox expertly joins in the funerary wootle<br />

>As the crew approach, Zox lets out a mournful wootle and rips his uniform top in half to reveal he was already greased up underneath. Then grabs a shuttle and starts moving vast quantities of earth out of the hole by hand. The wootled dirge continues apace<br />

>As the crew observe the strange Voth ritual, they hear a familiar voice from just behind them<br />

<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Quite a sight, isn't it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Indeed, quite the mournful sight<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ma'am, I hope you are well recovered.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Rhuk.png" alt="Rhuk" width="50" height="50">**Rhuk** We sought only peace for our colonies, far away from our warlike cousins...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Rhuk.png" alt="Rhuk" width="50" height="50">**Rhuk** We will forever stand by our fellow Earthkin and the federation until such a day as we can all relish that peace.<br />
*Rhuk emits a low sound in mourning.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Don't worry about politics Rhuk, today is a day of mourning.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** I don't want to sully your daughters memory with base political scheming<br />
*Kolea is glad Throk is not here, he would probably be considering what Voth would take like when covered with relish.*<br />

*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti pulls out a Padd and opens up a model of a hydrogen atom.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** You see, take this example<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** To be honest Viraseti, the Vulcan Science Academy, until a hundred years ago, had conclusively proven over multiple studies that time travel was impossible.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** In the case of a hydrogen atom, a single electron and a single proton (really three quarks but let's not get into that complexity right now) in order to predict the energy level of the electron you must consider more than the simple interaction of these two fields<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Rhuk.png" alt="Rhuk" width="50" height="50">**Rhuk** is the Federation not the soul of humanity?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Instead, every field which is capable of interacting with the electron, i.e. those are interactive with either the electromagnetic or weak nuclear fields, will introduce a perterbation due to quantum fluctuations that contributes, either positively or negatively, to the energy level of the electron<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I believe the bigger issue is that any sufficiently advanced science could be considered magic.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Thus: if you had an immortal soul which was capable of manipulating the electrons in your brain, which it would have to be in order to facilitate any two-way communication of information between your brain and your soul, its interaction cross section would contribute meaningfully to the Lam shift of these electrons<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** The expirmental limits on these contributions have conclusively rule out the notion that you have a soul, so no ma'am: I do not need to open my mind to the possibility or whatever<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** But thank you for the lovely headdress, I will replicate a suitable display cabinet for it in my quarters.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** What? What's wrong with my shuttle?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Are you seriously going to take that thing to an unknown location to track down a dangerous killer?<br />
*Zox sits up, leaving behind some charred scales.*<br />

*Admiral Janeway sighs*<br />
*Admiral Janeway taps her commbadge*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Computer, transfer command code authority to Lt. Commander Zox. Authorization Janeway, four seven sierra gamma zero one<br />
*Zox realizes that if Janeway produces a cool ship, Ghex will _never_ be quiet about it*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Don't scratch the paint<br />
*Ensign Ghex squeels in delight*<br />
*Kolea realizes that if we leave Old Faithless behind on this planet, Skig may space all of us.*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Admiral, could you kindly ensure that the death trap shuttle get returned to the Lister?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh don't worry Admiral, I will definitely not crash it again. I replicated it in the holodeck so I could play with ... I mean "practice" with it in my spare time.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Oh boy sir, I am really just super excited to fly this thing again. Sir, can I have permission to perform an unrestricted climb out? I think it is actually very important that I get a better idea of the climb performance of the flyer just in case we need to perform and similar agressive maneuvers in the future. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** I wholely support this! <br />

>INTERIOR - Briefing room: Malat submitted a request that the senior staff assemble for a briefing on the situation on Pelaria III. The staff file in and take their seats around the table.<br />

**Zox ** *(to Geret)*: I wasn't worried, we packed medical supplies!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Reporting in for Zox! I've got a whole claw-written set of instructions!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Make sure to not take them too literally, Zox's reports and directions are sometimes a bit... hyperbolic<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Ok, I have been reviewing the data from the anthropology team on the planet and I have a plan: we will need to be surgically altered to appear as Pelarians. We won't be able to use any of our technology as it would violate the prime directive, so we infiltrate and pretend to be pilgrims<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Then under cover of darkness, we break away from the main pilgrimage route and neutralize the guards, get into the underground cave, and tag the orb with a transporter patter enhancer<br />
*Darisha-Han considers how a fish-humanoid can be surgically altered....*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** That should allow us to beam it back to the Lister, and put a replica in its place<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The Pelarians will be none the wiser<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** This is really well thought out<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Wait, are you suggesting that we steal their religious artifact?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We can have Windbloom stealth in as an extra +1 as well, backup in case we need it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** We can't just take it. It's like... .important to them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Perhaps we should find out why it is there, how it arrived there, and if it is a functional part of their ecosystem that would be detrimental to their culture and environment?<br />
*Skig is fully expecting to further sink on her reputation score with Malat given that response.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do we have a way to scan and pick up its functionality without setting it off?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** However it got there, it belongs to Bajor<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Is the prime directive moot if another being violates it first?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** No, the mere presence of a single piece of advanced technology does not discharge our responsibilities under the prime directive<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** No it is not, though this itself doesn't automatically count as a violation of the prime directive<br />
*Darisha-Han writes down Bachar's sage captain wisdom.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think Skig's brought up a good point, though. We do want to see exactly what it does, and what purposes it's fulfilling, before we take action<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Oh good, they're here. I took the liberty of contacting the Vedek assembly on this<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** And how it arrived there.<br />
*Vedek Ojun Malat pulls up a comms channel, and a bajoran vedek appears on the screen*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vedek.png" alt="Vedek Ojun" width="50" height="50">**Vedek Ojun** Let me just say, I was thrilled when Lt. Commander Malat informed me of the orb you have all discovered on this planet. And the whole of Bajor is grateful for its discovery<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vedek.png" alt="Vedek Ojun" width="50" height="50">**Vedek Ojun** We are en route to your location with a vessel to bring the orb back to Bajor where it belongs.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** I'd say they get away with this behavior because they are non-prophet....but.......<br />
*Skig readies a full spread of photon torpedoes to remove the orb and the Pelarians from existence, solving the Trolley Problem by angering everyone.  (JUST KIDDING!)*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vedek.png" alt="Vedek Ojun" width="50" height="50">**Vedek Ojun** We will arive in approximately 20 of your hours, and we are very eager to see this orb for ourselves.<br />
