>INTERIOR -Bridge: As the ship continues to be rocked by disruptor blasts, the senior staff all rush back to their posts. Murry's new Jem'Hadar friends are escorted to the bridge on the captain's orders. And the crew must deal with the Jem'Hadar attack before the Lister is reduced to any more of a ruined heap than it already is.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We'll do introductions later, Murry do you think you can get your new friends to stop shooting us?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** What happened to my face<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh there it is<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We can give it a try, we won't be able to take much more of this. <br />

**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I would not shed any tears if you all died<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** But I see no reason to go out of my way to kill you<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our comms were destroyed before we left<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hardly a compelling argument, Jem'Hadar don't have tear ducts.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Standard tactical procedure would be to repair weapons, shields and engines before communications<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I have completed my Alpha Quadrant psychographic training module. We have learned to use your idioms and expressions to taunt you and harm your morale<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can we compare notes on that later, I think the order could be optimized.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** No<br />
*Skig has no morale, not sure what he is talking about, so ignores it.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, your loss.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We will be dead<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** and so will you<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, that's perhaps not unexpected. I don't suppose we could send a message the hard way? Send out a boarding party to pass it on directly? <br />
>The Lister lurches again as another attack pounds the shields<br />

*Second B'eor D'Tak pulls out a small device*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We have transporter return beacons<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** But we cannot beam through your shields<br />
**Throk:** THROK VOLUNTEER TO GO TO JEM'HADAR SHIP.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We can't lower the shields, the second we do those Jem'Hadar will obliterate us<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Can we make a small enough hole to beam through in a very small window of time?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No problem, if you want to give me that, I can adjust it to bypass our shield modulation without lowering them, then recalibrate the shield modulation to use a different frequency.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Worst case, you splatter like a bug on the inside of a windshield doing Warp 7.<br />
*Zox Is impressed with Skig's pragmatism, as always.*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** You Federations.. Always with your technological solutions<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak hands over the device*<br />
**Throk:** THROK LOVE THESE ODDS!<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I would have lowered the shields, and if we died, we died<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, but I would prefer the ship not take further damage while we are all dying.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** A ship is a tool<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** And your ship is an old piece of shit<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Alpha Quadrang Psychographic training<br />
*Skig looks at Jem'Hadar.*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** To harm morale<br />
*Skig eyes twitch slightly.*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Now do you understand furry one?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Sure.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If I can request to hold back on the proverbial pot shots while we're dealing with the literal ones, that would be fantastic<br />
*Zox appreciates this creature's keen tactical sense, it's _almost_ properly reptilian.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do you know that combined pressure of 7.8 Frenzer on the back of your neck will make you lose total control of your bowels, then puke up all your ketracel white, then beg for forgiveness prior to expiration?<br />
*Skig takes device from Jem'Hadar and reconfigures it.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** To Harm Morale.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Jem'Hadar do not beg, and we do not seek your forgiveness<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That remains to be seen.<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** How many people can this gadget of yours take?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Second B'eor D'Tak, what would you recommend for the best materials to send over with you? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Four, it is only meant to take me and my men<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I'm coming with you then<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I won't order someone else to beam into a Jem'Hadar ship alone<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Besides, if they don't stop shooting we're all dead anyways<br />
**Throk:** Throk think it not best idea for honourable Captain to die horribly alone away from loving grandchildren as Lister is sucked into Event Horizon.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Why do you spend so much time complaining about your deaths?<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Prepare yourself<br />
**Throk:** Throk think Murry already proven to have both mental good smarts and psychotic brutality to adapt well to Jem'Hadar lifestyle.<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak pulls out the transponder and stands next to the captain*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We can either prepare ourselves for it as if it's inevetable or take action to change things<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I can go with you, captain, if there's no objections. <br />
*Skig scribbles down note for Throk to be the next ship counselor if Murry dies.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Always good to have some company when beaming into your probably death<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Ishemok): Throkk is a walking Cheshire Fourth Wall</font><br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'll also want to reach out to the Federation ship to beam them updates. <br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak activates the transporter beacon with Captain Baras, Hailey Murry and Throk*<br />
>The bridge of the Jem'Hadar ship is even more of a mess than the Lister, as the Jem'Hadar seem to have foregone all repair efforts except for the weapons and tactical systems<br />

>Damaged optical lines, severed power lines, and ruptured EPS conduits are strewn about the deck. <br />

*Ishemok considers trying to sell packets of non-dairy coffee creamer as ketracel white to the Jem'Hadar.*<br />
>When the away team materializes, nearby Jem'Hadar pull out their disruptors immediately<br />

**First Taran K'lor:** What is the meaning of this, you are supposed to die before you are captured<br />
*Throk does not reciprocate, as "We come in peace" seems to have been the expected response.*<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak pulls out his own disruptor and holds it to Murry's head*<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** As you can see, I have not been captured<br />
**Throk:** I agree, mighty Jem'Hadar warrior definitely not captured.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** But there are some... developments that you must know of<br />
**Throk:** Also true.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Human, speak<br />
*Second B'eor D'Tak puts the data crystal containing Murry's historical records into the computer so the First can see*<br />
*Throk offers ketracel white coated popcorn to nearest Jem'Hadar who is not labeled "First" or "Second.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** The time dilation caused by the black hole means that you're a few years behind. With your permission, your second in command has records for the results of the war and the armistace<br />

![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I have come myself as a show of good faith. My officers and your second speak the truth. There is no need for all of us to die out here pointlessly.<br />
**Throk:** Throk have several knives to assist if people need pointed death. Even have Poinard for Murry Poignant death scene.<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** I doubt your veracity<br />
*First Taran K'lor puts his disruptor away*<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** Second, you will stay with this captain<br />
**First Taran K'lor:** If they betray us, kill him<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Victory is life<br />
**Throk:** Throk can vouch for Captain, Captain have absolutely no veracitic genes in entire DNA system, only geriatric ones.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Ah yes, the glorious victory of a genetically engineered super soldier vs. an old man<br />

**Kolea:** Throk offer to lick off, but Kolea say it not healthy.<br />
**Throk:** Throk offer to lick off, but Kolea say it not healthy.<br />
*Zox Looks at Bachar.*<br />
*Cmdr Bachar stands instead of sitting to avoid making the chairs dirty*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** There was a FIREFIGHT!<br />
**Kolea:** Yes Throk, also, you aren't supposed to steal my lines.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** After this briefing, perhaps you should find a working sonic shower and a clean uniform Commander<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Aye captain<br />
**Throk:** Throk only know, Kolea OnlyFans has 40x the subscriber viewership of this show. He must work as Night Shift Security Guard in Museum to pay bills. Maybe some day movie get made about this.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Well thank you Mr. Throk, for bringing the Commander back<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** You're dismissed, this is a senior staff briefing. As to that: what's our next move?<br />
*Throk leaves when instructed.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** We still have a second Jem'Hadar fighter and the Crazy out there<br />
*Kolea goes off to render "first aid" as needed.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Have we should hail the Crazy Horse already? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our wing had three fighters, not two<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Have we hailed the Crazy Horse already? <br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They are currently still outside our warp bubble<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailing the Crazy Horse would be very difficult, considering warp logistics and our own subspace bubble.<br />
![](../images/viraseti.png)**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti:** They are still experiencing high levels of time dilation, and will continue to do so until we get close enough<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Okay, so not much of a chance for them to come swooping in. How are the repairs coming along? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have maneuvering thrusters, so movement at any speed in any direction is problematic.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our ship has engines, but our warp core is destroyed. We must remain inside your warp bubble or become trapped again<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And fixing that is going to require taking the warp drives offline, which will cause us to get stuck in the same time dilation we were trying to avoid.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Although this seems cold blooded, it may be best to prioritize the Lister and whatever Jem'Hadar ships to safety before recovering the Crazy Horse and Missing Fighter #3. Time dialation means a fully fit vessel may recover them later at less risk.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we get ourselves out of the gravity well with just the maneuvering thrusters? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** In approximately... 114 years<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ugh<br />
*Skig looks at Zox.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we get ourselves to the Crazy Horse? <br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I agree with Zox, we need to rescue ourselves before we worry about the Crazy Horse and the other Jem'Hadar<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It isn't quite that simple sir. Orbital mechanics don't allow that<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We can't move in arbitrary directions this deep in the gravity well with only impulse<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** There's no path we can take to get out of the gravity that won't cause our warp bubble to intersect the Crazy Horse and the other Jem'Hadar fighter<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have no sensors, our superstructure is crippled without serious repair options. Impulse and Warp I might be able to cobble something together for a short period of time.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Would it expedite or enable repairs if the Jem'Hadar abandon one of their attack vessels as salvage and come aboard the Lister?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Brutal, cold blooded lizard reality?<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We have engines and weapons, but our sensors and shields are completely destroyed<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes. =D<br />

[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 16]**<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I do not know if our systems are compatible enough that you could repair your ship with our parts<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Our best option might be to see what we can cobble together from scavenging parts off the Jem'Hadar fighter to get the Lister able to reach the Crazy Horse as we drift in that direction.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** And First Taran K'lor is not about to allow that without a fight<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is there only one other Jem'Hadar ship in here? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our attack wing had three <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Do you mean to say that he would not allow that, or that we would have to duel him first? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Moments before you arrived, one of our ships dissapeared from our scopes<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** We assumed you had destroyed them<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yah but you aren't going to find a glorious end against either boredom or a black hole. Your best bet is getting out of this.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hold on, when you say moments, do you mean seconds or minutes? <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our sensors detected a Starfleet warp signature for a split-second, then our third craft vanished. You arrived a few seconds later<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wait, Second, do you have a functional tractor beam?<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Yes, our tractor beam is operational<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You have engines, correct?<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Yes<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Impulse power<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You are inside our warp bubble<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We were attracted to the system here because we detected a Traveller-style warp bubble signature. It's possible that they got pulled out by someone or something else before we arrived. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** But he said it was a Starfleet warp signature, if it was a Starfleet ship why would they rescue a Jem'Hadar fighter and not the Crazy Horse?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** 's ears begin to leak smoke as he contemplates time-paradoxes<br />
*Zox 's ears begin to leak smoke as he contemplates time-paradoxes*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Insufficient information.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, Franken-ship time. We have functional shuttlecraft we can deploy and attach to the Jem'Hadar ship via magenetic grapples. They can use their sensors to feed the Jem'Hadar fighter and the Lister with what they can pick up. The Jem'Hadar fighter will pull the Lister via tractor beam to keep the entire collection of Orky Space Hulk within the Time Dilation Bubble. Then we push towards the position of the Crazy Horse.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I agree with Zox, let's file that away under "fascinating but not relevant to our current predicament"<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** At the point where we have a functional Crazy Horse to work with, we can revisit how to get everyone out of the Black Hole gravitic fields, assuming they are not comparably damaged and we are all stuck scavenging for making an even larger Orky Space Hulk.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** Skig that may be the craziest plan you have suggested yet. And I am including the ones where you want to sacrifice the crew to save the ship<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Do you have a better idea?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Which is closer to us, the Crazy Horse or the other Jem'Hadar ship? <br />
*Cmdr Bachar grumbles*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think it is up to the captain to decide, but we should save ourselves and send in a more capable ship to rescue the Crazy Horse, which has been stuck here for years<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We currently have no working sensors, but last time we had a positional scan the Jem'Hadar fighter was aft of the Crazy Horse, 60,000 km nearer to us<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** If we can get within range of the Crazy Horse, it can do a better job pulling us. <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** We'll need to get within comms range and somehow convince both ships not to fire before they blast us out of the sky<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Well, we can convince the Crazy Horse, but Second B'eor D'Tak or First Taran K'lor would be best to convince the last Jem'Hadar Vessel<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Correct. I think a Jem'Hadar ship towing the Lister would probably give them reason to pause<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Also, it's easy to get a signal to the Crazy Horse, I've already calculated a way to time it to hit when our warp bubble intersects theirs.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Though I'm not sure about the Crazy Horse. <br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** Our ship will ignore any comms from your vessel, and our communications are destroyed<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I sent a distress signal 2.5 scenes ago, as is compliant with Star Fleet Policy on entering deadly combat unilaterally.<br />
**Second B'eor D'Tak:** I will beam to their bridge and order them to stand down, and if they do not I will kill their First and take command<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Superb!<br />
*Throk wishes he was there, because that is exactly how a Gorn would do it also and he would 100% support this plan.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We can send a second signal to overlap to the first quite easily. We just need to start working on repairs.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Ok, we're probably going to all die together, but Skig's crazy idea is the only one I've heard<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** So let's get moving<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I was hoping someone had a better idea.<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Who is piloting the shuttle craft to provide the sensor relay?<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): If only we had rolled up a large number of pilots.... oh wait...</font><br />
**Ishemok:** Pilot, Ready for Orders!<br />
**Mowus:  [d20 = 9]**<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Let's get moving, get 2 pilots to the shuttles, and we'll need someone on comms to send an update to the Crazy Horse. <br />
**Kurij:** Ready to pilot as well! <br />
*Ishemok looks at Skig *<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Great meeting, let's try not to die in the next 10 minutes<br />
*Throk is not convinced that request is at all achievable.*<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Everyone get to it, Commander Bachar... Go get washed off and get a clean uniform<br />
**Ishemok:** O'k warbozz Skig, I iz gonna pilot dis fing, but dere' betta be some shiny bitz were dis WAAAGH goin.<br />
**Ishemok:** Oh...sorry. You mentioned Space Hulk. Happens.<br />

>Skig attempts to leap over to the power distribution station, but she forgot that her chair had wheels, so it slipped out from under her when she tried to push off it. Fortunately, Zox suddenly remembered that his species has a prehensile tail that's never come up before, and was able to swing her over safely before she took 8d6 of damage with Vicious 2<br />
