>Captains Log, Stardate 62200.5: We are en route to the Pelarian System to respond to a request for engineering assistance from a Federation Anthropolgy team based there.

In the meantime, Zox has requested leave to return to his home planet to attend a funerary rite for his sister. I am somewhat concerned about the request for a pilot in case he is "incapacitated" so I have asked Kolea to accompany him as well. <br />

>INTERIOR - Shuttlecraft: Zox, Geret and Kolea arrive at the shuttlecraft that Bachar has approved for them. As they enter, they find Ghex sitting at the conn completing her preflight checks. When Zox enters she pops up and nervously half-salutes, half-waves<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Hello!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Tired of big ships?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Uhm, I saw the request for a pilot sir, and I know that there are other pilots on board and you don't really need me and stuff. I mean, any pilot can handle ferrying you back-and-forth to your planet. It's not like this is some dangerous mission or anything, and theoretically it is a bit "low-level" for the chief conn officer... But, uhm... I was hoping I could go, because I am sort of kind of responsible for your sister's death. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** If you don't mind that is. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I can also leave. I should probably leave, now that I think about it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** This was kind of maybe a pretty bad idea<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Eh, things happen.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ghex, it is okay and I think you should come with us.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** It is a natural tendency to both feel guilt and want to atone for mistakes.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** It's either flying or making a fuss over the right preparations. This is more natural.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** The roar of thrusters, easy flying...what's not to love?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Ok, in that case I'll try not to get shot down and crash into a greehouse this time.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I have confidence in your flying skills, you will do fine.<br />
>As Ghex turns back to the conn to complete her preflight checks, Lt. Commander Viraseti walks into the shuttle dragging a large travel case behind her. She shoves the case into the under seat storage in the back of the shuttle and sits down reading a PADD without saying a word to anyone<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** And I'll do my best to not accidentally shapeshift into Zox's sister, because that would be very awkward for you. <br />
**Geret:  [2d20 = 22]**<br />
**Geret:  [d20 = 4]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I mean...It would end worse for you Geret. They may think you undead.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): still healthier than a horta ex</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Viraseti, packing for a long trip?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Something like that<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** I see.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Whatcha bringing there?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** Come forth, for we shall embark upon a journey through the skies of yonder planet! <br />
*Kolea drops her "medical bag" on a shelf.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Geret is carrying a Harp and a bow and arrow<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Why do you care what's in my bag?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Dieties are predictable. I don't have to harp on their gear.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** I had G'ralan put a phaser into the bow, so it can actually shoot as long as I go through the motions!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Well, I don't want to spoil the surprise<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** So you'll just have to wait<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Fair enough!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Ok, wow this shuttle trip is going to be way weirder than I was expecting<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** I'm ready to leave though, everyone take your seats and prepare for departure<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  COMMAND  (2)]

<img src="../images/auto/Geret.png" alt="Geret" width="50" height="50">**Geret** A god need not sit! We stand proud!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** make it so!<br />
>Ghex pilots the shuttle up and out of the aft shuttle bay as Geret stows her harp and phaser bow safely under her seat<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Ghex, you should have come to expect this by now.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): Fun to have two RNG give us two gimmick TOS aliens.</font><br />
>INTERIOR - Brig: Skig, Hailey, Malat and some guy head to the brig to interrogate the prisoners. On the monitors, they can see Krepeka's body, McCallister, and a Cardassian in three separate cells.<br />

<font color="#005500">KruschtyaEquation (Hailey Murry): lmao "and some guy"</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** You seem vaguely familiar.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Ghex is my third aunt's neice. Everyone simply knows everyone!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well I just hope you don't talk as much<br />
*Darisha-Han continues writing on a pad made of synthetic paper.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Talk? no Ma'am im here to learn!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Who do we want to question first? I can bring them into an interrogation room.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Heads, MacAllister, Tails Cardassian.<br />
**Skig:  [Total: 1] [Effects: 0] [dChallenge = 1]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Cardassian it is.<br />
>Malat gestures to a junior security officer who accompanies her into the cells, and they then return with the Cardassian prisoner and sit him in the chair in the interrogation room. He does not react at all.<br />

*Skig sits down across from the Cardassian.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Hello.<br />
*Cardassian Man continues to sit silenty.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Can I get you something to drink?<br />
*Darisha-Han Scribbles 'Cardassian with a vendetta against dinosaurs gives Skig the silent treatment;*<br />
*Cardassian Man leans back in his chair, ignoring Skig*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I've had my share of experience dealing with Cardassian intelligence officers, they usually don't start talking until you remove a few fingers<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Too obvious.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** It's fun though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Why don't you go replicate a Raktajino and I'll take over for a minute<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you recognize this gentleman? <br />
*Darisha-Han With keen insight, Hailey tries to shatter the implacable, iron-clad facade of the Cardassian agent.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Do you have the rest of them, or should I get pictures of the others?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We're really hoping to be able to identify them. They were extracted under difficult circumstances.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I have melted Cardassians before<br />
*Skig offers Darisha a stick of bubblegum and the opportunity to stay quiet.*<br />
*Darisha-Han acceps the gum*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Due to the circumstances in the junkyard after your... well, presumably your comrades, killed its owner and caused such a ruckus, we had to do something with them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Are you willing to help us help them? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Many Cardassians melted in the Dominion War, I prefer not to melt more without cause.<br />
**Cardassian Man** I will gladly help you. Release me and I will give you a quick and painless death<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, that's unfortunate.<br />
**Cardassian Man** They are beyond help, they are already dead.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Actually, no, they are not.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** They're all very painstakingly alive<br />
*Darisha-Han resist the urge to sell next generation cyronic technologies.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** But as a Cardassian, what do you need a pile of dead Cardassians for?<br />
**Cardassian Man** Your foolish Federation optimism cannot undo their deaths, they may still have a handful of heartbeats, but they are dead.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): But, Darisha, Next Generation is no longer making new episodes and in syndication. Clearly we need to sell the Discovery Cyronic Technologies!</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Wait, so you're not the one who had them in stasis? <br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Darisha-Han): I can't figure out if franchises spoil, or getting things right is just a matter of serendipity. </font><br />
*Skig blinks and looks at Malat.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I missed something, when did we develop "optimism" on this ship?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We have a lot of optimism<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I don't mean the cryptocurrency relays running through the sensor system.<br />
*Darisha-Han ponders using the holodeck to get information out of Cardassian Man*<br />
*Darisha-Han passes a note to Hailey Murry suggesting this strategy.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): I think geeting things right is a matter of "serenity" and then it gets killed by executives.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, so back to the question, they are almost dead. What do you need a pile of dead Cardassians for?<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Malat passes a note saying that this guy isn't going to say anything unless you let her torture him*<br />
*Skig passes note from Malat to Murry.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Or a pile of almost-dead Cardassians<br />
*Darisha-Han passes a note wanting details on the various torture methods, approved and unapproved, that she would employ, and also how many lights there really are*<br />
*Skig passes note back to Malat, "Do Cardassians have kneecaps and do they know what they taste like?"*<br />

*Darisha-Han nods enthusiastically, antenae bouncing. *<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Or what their duty is.<br />
**Cardassian Man** Of course I know where they came from.<br />
**Cardassian Man** I am not a fool stumbling blindly in the dark like you. I KNOW my duty<br />
*Skig waits for the "when two Cardassians love each other very much" joke.*<br />
*Cardassian Man is getting increasingly angry and raising his voice*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do they even have a duty anymore? After all, they are... what was it, "basically dead"?<br />
**Cardassian Man** They lived for Cardassia, they died for Cardassia, and in death they will serve Cardassia<br />
*Darisha-Han oooh ooh, an esoteric question from Hailey!*<br />
*Darisha-Han produces a cigarette that blows bubbles. *<br />
**Cardassian Man** You Federation types with your valuable "individualism" will never understand the purity of our duty to Cardassia.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** This guy is a little bit of a square, any chance doc windblooom has something to fix this?<br />
*Darisha-Han continues to blow bubbles with a cigarette.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Very well, what is their duty to Cardassia? Because if it is importabt, it should be honored. We Federation types best understand other cultures when the opportunity to see things from their perspective.<br />
*Cardassian Man stands up out of his chair*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** As our CMO keeps telling me, Truth is a Triple Edged Sword, so stab me with your best example of what the duty of a Cardassian is.<br />
*Skig remains completely unflustered and seated.*<br />
**Cardassian Man** You mock our duty, our commitment to Cardassia! These men died in service to an ideal. You live soft lives, easy lives, you will never understand what it means to serve without reservation.<br />
*Cardassian Man is now shouting*<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
**Cardassian Man** You want to know their duty? You want to understand their purpose? The purpose for which their deaths have been postponed? You will understand soon enough.<br />
**Cardassian Man** FOR CARDASSIA!<br />
