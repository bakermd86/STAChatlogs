>INTERIOR - Drug Lab Cargo Bay: Jasanis stands on top of the pile of foam, covered in bits of unset foam, and holding a detonator in her hand with the dead-man's switch already depressed.<br />

**Jasanis:** One more bit of interference from you and you can kiss your Lister goodbye. I drop this hammer, and her warp core implodes<br />
**Jasanis:** Don’t test me, I don’t necessarily WANT that on my criminal record forever, but I will not hesitate if you make me<br />

**Throk:** Throk see Captain Baras as example of Starfleet Captain. He mostly sit around and do nothing. Biggest danger is getting stuck in restroom.<br />
**Throk:** Throk have to tear off doors a couple times.<br />
**Talak:** The Admiral is quite hands-on, a true man-of-the-people. As I understand it, he finds himself in all sorts of dangerous situations<br />
**Talak:** Enemy vessels, black holes, spacial anomolies, you never know what can happen on a starship<br />
**Throk:** Indeed, Starfleet vessels are very exciting. Gorn vessels boring by comparison. Biggest danger is tripping in vacuum tube room and taking out main computer core.<br />
**Talak:** Yes, Gorn technology is rudimentary by comparison<br />
**Throk:** Admiral sound very fascinating, but insurance policy premium quite high.<br />
**Talak:** Oh, you have no idea<br />
**Throk:** What sort of rider on policy you provide?<br />
*Zox , the Friendly Neighborhood Dinosaur, walks in.*<br />
**Talak:** I'm afraid you don't have much that would be of value to me<br />
**Throk:** N<br />
**Throk:** No, not me, I am curious about Admiral rider policies.<br />
**Kolea:** I love being ridden by Admirals.<br />
*Throk sprays Kolea with a water bottle.*<br />
**Talak:** I can't divulge the specifics of my clients' needs<br />
**Talak:** Surely you understand <br />
**Throk:** Totally understandable, professional courtesy being important in insurance sales line of work.<br />
**Talak:** If you did want to buy a policy from me, I believe some of your shipmates are trying to take possession of something which would be of great value<br />
**Throk:** Throk feel the same way about when bones of slain get stuck between teeth of other Gorn. Very impolite to point it out.<br />
**Throk:** My shipmates? They are busy making sure Lister is in good shape. What do you think my shipmates are doing?<br />
**Talak:** The humans have a parable: the wolf in sheep's clothing.<br />
**Talak:** In this case, the wolf stole that clothing. And I would be willing to offer you a very fine policy if I get it back<br />

>MEANWHILE.. INTERIOR - Drug Lab Cargo Bay: Jasanis is lying on the ground, hogtied and knocked out<br />

>Kolea's tricorder beeps out: "Pika, Pika"<br />

*Kolea checks pulse.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zoxar:** Evaucation Protocol! Doctor, what's the fastest way out of here!<br />
**Kolea:** Not ovulating yet, so that must mean we are about to be attacked.<br />
>As the crew spin around to look for danger, multiple oozelings comes out of the vents and cracks in the floor, and congeal around Jasnis, causing her to double in size and sprout oozy gooey tentacles from her arms and hair<br />

*Kolea checks what she injected Jasanis with.*<br />
**Kolea:** Oh, whoops. That was the Nausican Pheromone Enhancer version, she smells exactly like the perfect mixture of Nausican and delicious oozeling paste. Sorry about that... well... not really.<br />
