>INTERIOR - Deck 11: Skig opens the hatch to Deck 10 and sees a dark tangle of Borg conduits and equipment, bathed in a dim sickly green light. The whir of Borg widgets can be heard echoing down the darkened corridors.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh no. Which of your ships is this?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I would like to claim this is unexpected, but it is not really.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The element we have in our favor is that Borg-Skig likely would not expect to be countered by another Skig.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/lt_cmdr_skig.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Skig" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Skig** I think it would be best to choose a different deck to traverse to the saucer section<br />

<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** Deck 10 won't get you there anyways, you'll have to take Deck 6, 7, 8 or the airlock on deck 9 and walk across the hull<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Wouldn't the borb be harmless? I mean if they can't communicate via subspace, they'd be unable to act?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes, I was going to suggest the route on the outside of hte ship.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/chief_skig.png" alt="Chief Skig" width="50" height="50">**Chief Skig** I don't think I want to take that chance<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Each deck is confined to a pocket of....some other dimensionality. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** They'd be like deaf bats<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** This puts us on a substantial time limit, though. Because if they begin to expand through the other Listers...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Lets make sure we have suitable magnetic boots and transit equipment to take the airlock over the hull.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Indeed, I would prefer not to have Borg-Skig infext other dimensions. The inherent chaos of other space time continuums would very much damage her inner calm.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Let's head up<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** One Lister is bad enough, an almost infinite supply of them would be far too much untidy clutter on my beautiful ship.<br />
*Skig leads the group to the airlock with appropriate equipment for outer hull traversal.*<br />
*Skig hands out gear to the rest of the crew.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Thanks!<br />
>Skig leads the team past Deck 10 and through Deck 9 to the airlock. Deck 9 seems to be very business as usual, so signs of disaster, some of the crew give strange looks at the trio of Skigs wandering through the halls but no Borg at least<br />

*Skig looks desperately for a name tag on the Vulcan science officer.*<br />
**Hailey Murry ** *(softly)*: It looks like the crew here are either drugged or at least on mood stabilizers. Look at the blank expressions.<br />
**Crewman Bob** I'm doing good counselor, no issues to report<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Wait... that's NOT normal?<br />
