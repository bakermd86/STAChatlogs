>Elsewhere, in a Jeffries tube near deck 36, Skig, Viraseti, Murry and Rhuk are descending towards the shuttlebay when they hear a screeching sound from several decks above them in the jeffries tubes<br />

>Skig looks up and sees a swarm of Voth-Sneks descending the Jeffries tube several decks above them<br />

**Laak:** Well, at least they're not heading towards us, huh? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is rather unfortunate. Forgive me, Lister.<br />
*Skig pulls the emergency bulkhead release which blows out the decompression clamps and slams the blast doors shut between them and the Voth-Sneks.*<br />
**Rhuk:** Whew I feel safer.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Of course, the problem here being, getting back the other direction without working transporters is going to be highly problematic.<br />
**Rhuk:** Thank you small intelligent mammal.<br />
*Hailey Murry screams as Skig suddenly blows out the clamps*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Warnings! You nearly gave me a heart attack<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But yes, tahnk you<br />
*Skig raises eyebrow at Hailey.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would think a Demolitions Expert would not have that problem. Must be a side effect of your proclivities.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Demolitions typically use setup before blowing things up<br />

*Hailey Murry pulls out her tricorder and pauses just long enough to pull one of the speakers. She quickly wires it into her tricorder and clicks some buttons, setting it down behind her and sets it on a delay to hopefully give the horrible lizard creatures vertigo as they pass and send them further down than they intend*<br />

>Rhuk pulls a bioneural gel repair kit out of an access panel and stabs the gel injector into the base of Skig's skull<br />

>[TURN] Voth-Snek alien<br />

**Rhuk:** No. We must do battle with these creatures.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** No. We must do battle with these creatures.<br />
**Neraran:** Why, the bridge doesn't have power. We should get down to engineering where we can get control of the power grid and "rescue" the ship.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Surely there are more qualified personel to do that task. <br />
**Laak:** Good point<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We go back into the tubes!<br />
**Neraran:** Plus, I happen to know that someone has some anti-tank weaponry stored down in the shuttle bay. Why it is there I have no idea.<br />
**Laak:** To Neraran, I'm a big fan of working with what you've got<br />
**Laak:** Especially if what you've got is an anti-tank missile<br />
>[TURN] Zox<br />

>[TURN] Lt. Malat<br />

**Neraran:** No, mostly phaser dispersion cannons and a canister launcher.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We can't use some of those inside the ship.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** We must engage HAND TO HAND<br />
**Neraran:** Right sir!  You get stuck in there and I will assist you!<br />

**Laak:** Wait, I think I can make this cricket bat more dangerous. We can electrofy it, basically make it a stun baton!<br />
>Laak pulls a still powered EPS capacitor from the holodeck power system and crudely straps it to his cricket bat<br />

*Skig shrugs.*<br />
**Rhuk:** What's this sticker on the trolley mean? Do not ride?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait, didn't that part have the brake button on it as well?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That's because the crew likes to push them around and go redshirt bowling using the used anti-matter canisters as pins at the end of the jefferies tube.<br />
>Skig helps Rhuk and Murry onto the lift and pushes them down the corridor, as they speed away, a massive pulse of energy erupts from the back of the trolley towards Skig and Viraseti<br />

**Neraran:** Thank you sir, I am proud to use my abilities to assist Starfleet.<br />
**Laak:** Is that going to be safe to travel through or should we go around?<br />
>Neraran's improvised weapon of mass desctruction erupts into a gas cloud that obscures the pack of sneks. Horrible screeching and howling can be heard echoing up the Jeffries tube.<br />

**Laak:** Woo, that's a good bodycount<br />
**Neraran:** Thanks, I am happy to use my abilities to assist Starfleet.<br />
