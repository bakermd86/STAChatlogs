**Kolea:** Zox, we should transport to Hailey's location, it is where Jasanis would be and she's likely to end up dead if left alone.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Energize!<br />
>Zox slaps his communicator but hears nothing back except a dull hiss<br />

*Zox charges his phaser, set to business mode.*<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm?<br />
*Lt. Malat points out the window*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Understood Security Chief, I will bring the transporters online as soon as possible. In the interim, I need to maintain the connection via an acoustic keepalive, unfortunately the only audio I have right now is Cavieka's collection of Klingon Opera.<br />

>Zox sees several dozen Nausicaans surrounding the building, and storming the entrances<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): Sorry, I was channeling Neraran there.</font><br />
**Oakadan:** I think that, while satisfying, collapsing the security tower on the enemies here would be ill advised<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hrm, this is quite a doozy.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The way to minimize casualties is to jet, as clearly they are after us. We will leave a trap in this room however. Over yonder on the street are their jammers, banned in several systems, we are gonna have to pop em before we can teleport.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Oakadan, Malat, can you set a trap at the door while Kolea and I take care of the Jammers?<br />
*Kolea hoists up her Phaser Type-3.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Aye sir<br />
**Kolea:** Sir, I feel obligated at this point to mention this is a pull start device requiring 6D batteries for medical stress relief purposes.<br />

>Malat and Oakadan start to rig up a force-field emitter cell to the door, but they accidentally short the cell, and it begins to rapidly overheat<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Shit. Sir, we have maybe 10 seconds before it blows<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW<br />
**Kolea:** Throw it out the window!<br />
*Zox nods at Kolea *<br />
*Lt. Malat shoots out a window and jumps out onto the ledge*<br />

>[TURN] Zox<br />

*Zox 's scales turn a flustered hue*<br />
*Zox rips out a large office chair from the surroundings, wedging it under the rapidly overheating improvised device. After jumping onto the highest bookshelf in the room, and yelling various Voth Professional Wrestling move names, he suplexes the chair, using it as a catapult/lever and propelling the contraption out of the room onto one of the transporter jammers below.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Bullseye sir!<br />
**Kolea:** By Grapthar's Hammer, they have been Avenged!<br />
**Oakadan:** Good shot! <br />
*Zox grins in reptile.*<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Transports are back online, where would you like to be transported to?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hailey! On the bounce! Let's go!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, but I have to warn you, you might materialize with random string cheese hanging from you.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Don't ask, but I'm pretty sure Ensign Walters is getting a reprimand from this.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... the jamming field seems to be effective at blocking your signals, you will either need to move higher or destroy at least another one. Or I can try to beam you in a smaller group from where you are.<br />

>Zox hits the second jammer with a shot from his phaser and it sputters out in a cloud of black smoke<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** One more should do it! I can tell by the way my nasal cavity tingles.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, Zox, you need to either move four floors up from where you are, or I can transport two of you out at a time.<br />

*Kolea pulls out her phaser and peeks over the table, then shoots past a Nausican, obviously missing him. There is an ominous hiss from what she just shot though...*<br />
>Kolea ruptures a coolant vent causing thick fog to flood the hallway, the away team loses sight of the Nausicaans for the moment as the fog reduces all the visibility to 0 in the corridor<br />

>Several Nausicaans converge on one of the jammers and manage to jury-rig it back into a working state<br />

>With the corridor flooded by fog, the away team can only hear the Nausicaans running around and some sounds of clattering and commotion<br />

>The commotion dies down momentarily before the silence is broken by a hum that rapidly rises into a high trill.<br />

>Out of the fog, countless disruptor bolts fly down the hallway and through the security office from a fixed heavy disruptor cannon that the Nausicaans have erected at the other end of the hall<br />
