![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Captains Log, Stardate 61623.0 - Our mission to survey the gaseous giants of the Xiran cluster has been abruptly cancelled, and we have recieved new orders to rendezvous with a fleet forming near Starbase 17. We haven't been given any details about the mission, but the rendezvous date is not for several days, so we are proceding at warp 5.

In the meantime, many of the crew are taking some time off. If we are being pulled back into a large fleet operation, we may all be pulling long duty shifts for a while. I can hardly blame them for trying to get a bit of R&R before the rendezvous.<br />

>INTERIOR - Corridor outside Holodeck 4: Counselor Murry approaches the door to Holodeck 4 wearing a matching set of burnt umber slacks and a vest, with a white blouse and a plaid blazer. There she finds Lt. Malat, also strangely dressed with a brown bomber jacket over a tie-dye shirt, denim jeans and black leather strapped boots up to her knees.<br />

![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** You get a weird message from the twins too?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I did, I'm a bit concerned that you did as well<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What'd they tell you?<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Just that they needed someone with a "prior criminal record" to help them with a problem<br />
*Lt. Malat rolls her eyes*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** They said they needed my "unique approach to problem solving"<br />
*Hailey Murry does air quotes*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Whatever that means<br />
>The Twins step around the corner wearing matching dark purple tuxedoes over black undershirts, with black slacks and matching purple suede shoes.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** All in good time Counselor<br />
*Skig senses a disturbance in the Force, as if an entire deck of the Lister was suddenly exposed to vacuum.*<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 walk over to the holodeck controls and begin entering in commands*<br />
*Skig 's eyes twitch whenever anyone tells Murry they appreciate her approach to "problem solving".*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We can see that Commander Skig is not here yet, we anticipated that she may disregard our invitation<br />
>The Twins reach into a wall panel and disconnect an ODN power regulation monitoring circuit from inside the wall<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** ODN diagnostic system specifications require that power regulators report health status every 10 seconds to the main computer. It will then take Commander Skig 12 seconds to reach the turbolift from her desk, and another 14 seconds for the turbolift to get here from main engineering.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So the Commander should be joining us in: 5... 4... 3... 2... 1<br />
*Skig shows up in uniform with a repair kit.*<br />
*Skig looks at the twins.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Glad to have you join us, Skig<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 reconnect the ODN regulator*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There is a reason for disconnecting ODN regulators that would imply I not write you up?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Just give us a moment Commander, it will take a few moments for the program to load. We have prepared a speech for this purpose.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This is foreboding<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We will attempt to explain why we are here, while we wait for the holodeck<br />
*Skig checks chronometer, sets it to, "Moment" and pushes "Start".*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have this... puzzle game? You could call it, with our former academy roommate Hollis O'Keefe<br />
*Skig is great fun at parties.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We compete to send one another coded messages. It began many years ago with simple substitution ciphers and other such things, but has gotten progessively more complicated over the years<br />
*Hailey Murry exchanges a worried glance at Malat*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The puzzle which Hollis has concocted has too many moving pieces for us to solve alone. We believe that it is his intention to force us to seek assistance, in order to encourage us to develop deeper interpersonal relationships with our crewmates.<br />
*Skig checks chronometer again to see if "Moment" has passed.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ah, the program is finished loading. We have one more crewmate coming however, just a moment<br />
>The Twins tap a control on the holodeck control arch and a holographic representation of Ishemok materializes just inside the holodeck threshold. He is wearing a white and black checkerboard suit, with an oversize stetson hat and white aligator-skin shoes. In his hands: a black leather briefcase with gold accents.<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Computer, please begin broadcasting audio file 100101110101101010010011 via the internal comms radio at a frequency of 790 Mhz<br />
**Ishemok:** Howdy Partners!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Looking sharp, Ishemok<br />
>The Twins lead the motley assortment through the holodeck arch and into a dingy industrial building. Metal shavings line the floor, and the air is thick with the smell of machine oil. The echo of the crew's footsteps is muffled by the hum of a large 3-phase inverter powering an assortment of machining equipment, and a small transistor radio in the corner is playing.<br />

*Skig blinks a few times as she wonders why she is not filing a report for the Twins sabotaging an ODN Circuit.*<br />
>The twins take out a small set of printed paper cards from their breast pocket<br />

>♫♫♫Upbeat music plays from the radio♫♫♫<br />

**Ishemok:** I heard there's either a heist or a card game somewhere east of Dodge.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The data is stored in a quantum encrypted memory region embedded inside a holoprogram. It is only accessible from within the holoprogram, and only at a single point.<br />
**Transistor Radio:** ♫♫♫ Now Leroy he a gambler, and he like his fancy clothes.♫♫♫ And he like to wave his diamond rings under everybody's nose♫♫♫<br />
>The twins walk up a set of sheet metal stairs to a small granny flat above the shop<br />

*Ishemok is offended by the music, damaging to his sensistive ears.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The setting of his program is Earth, in a city called Las Vegas. It is Earth-year 1973, and his message is hidden there...<br />
>The Twins pull back the curtains on the windows and point out a large hotel in the distance, several miles away, towering over a low, broad casino: "De Soto's Fortune"<br />

**Transistor Radio:** ♫♫♫ He got a custom Continental, he got an El Dorado too ♫♫♫ He got a 32 gun in his pocket full a fun. He got a razor in his shoe ♫♫♫<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The encrypted memory region is mapped to the inside of the casino's vault, and it is our intention to steal it.<br />
**Ishemok:** Ah, the golden years of Earth!<br />
>The Twins put on matching dark sunglasses and attempt to look "cool" as they beam with pride at their definitely not-at-all choreographed and pre-practiced speech.<br />

**Transistor Radio:** ♫♫♫ And he's bad, bad Leroy Brown, the baddest man in the whole damn town♫♫♫ Badder than old King Kong and meaner than a junkyard dog♫♫♫<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** This actually sounds quite fun! <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Computer, end music.<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 put away their note cards*<br />
*Skig wonders why they didn't ask Kolea to show up for a trip to Las Vegas, after all, it was a den of iniquity and prostitution.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Can we call upon others if we find a need for them, or is this limited to just the five of us? <br />
*Skig makes a mental note to still report the Twins for disconnecting the ODN circuit.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We can include others as needed, however there was only room in the program memory to map four player IDs onto existing character identities within the simulation<br />
*Hailey Murry is definitely planning on having not seen anything of the sort, and is pretty sure she can convince Malat to attest the same*<br />
**Ishemok:** How did all this glory vanish! It's beautiful!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As such, we chose the four crewmates who were the most likely to have skills that would be required to adequately execute a "heist"<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I'm not sure this glory originally existed, this can simply be programmed through pre-obtained assets. Some are historical, but plenty are artist renditoins<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** From a statistical analysis of Earth-based media from this period, we determined that a successful heist always has an engineering wizard, someone that can overcome technical and mechanical challenges as needed<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 look at Skig*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So your plan is to have us sneak into a holodeck created Casino Vault to steal some encrypted data from a program that is only accessible from within the vault as part of some long running game you have been engaged in?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, precisely that<br />
*Skig sighs.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** And you disconnected an ODN circuit for this?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed we did<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We also prepared a speech<br />
**Ishemok:** But Skig, this is the perfect way to sell your genius! No consequences! No commanders not appreciating your talent!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Has your positironic matrix been checked after you were violently assaulted and phaser blasted by Murry?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis of heist media suggests that the leader of a "crew" has to often convince the members of their conspiracy to participate via an inspiring speech<br />
*Ishemok stands at attention.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** No, no, it's okay, if Skig doesn't think she's got the necessary engineering skills, that's pretty fair<br />
*Lt. Malat chuckles*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Yeah, Skig probably can't hack it with this ancient Earth technology<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** She would be helpless without a laser welder and an electron beam cutter<br />
*Skig waits patiently for the Twins to respond.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Yeah, it was pretty much game over when she had to put the repair equipment down in the hallway<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We should get a real engineer like T'kor in here, I'm sure he can manage <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): You aren't insulting the Lister, she is pretty much impervious/oblivious to insults directed at her, FYI.</font><br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We have prepared a brief dossier on each of the characters that your identities have been mapped onto<br />
*Hailey Murry accepts the dossier*<br />
*Hailey Murry checks the street for this "Plymouth Valiant"*<br />
*Skig reads dossier.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wait, I get to save body parts from those who fail to follow proper instructions?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I'm sold.<br />
*Skig opens the fridge and takes out some cans of something called, "Pabst Blue Ribbon".*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This appears to be some sort of slightly flammable liquid that is not intended for consumption.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our analysis indicates a 98.6% water content, with a small ammount of ethanol<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Okay, I'm sure we will figure out something to do with them, it is pressurized and carbonated.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, do we have a map of the facility? <br />
*Zehpr 'Chops' Megee materializes in the room*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Partially, the casino is itself stored in an encrypted block of memory, and so we can only datamine a limited amount of data<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 pull out a large printed paper sheet and unroll it on the table*<br />
*Skig uses full cans of Pabst to hold down the corners to make it easier to read.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** They can be used as paperweights, evidently.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We were able to obtain accurate imaging of all of the public areas of the casino floor, and reconstruct a rudimentary blueprint of the non-public areas from datamining<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We also tracked the patrol routes of the casino guards, but at that point it became clear that we would not be able to execute the plan on our own<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** So we began planning to involve others for assistance<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 looks at Zox*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Oh, hello commander<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Ah yes, I do not mean to interrupt your recreation<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We had not anticipated your participation<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** But I must alert you all that I have had to alter your fun and games...just a tad though.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, it is rec-reation or re-creation though, that is the question.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What did you modify? <br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** There was no free Quantum memory aboard the lister, and Jasanis had a self-eating oroborous-type data worm in her Padd. The only safe quantum storage was where this program was writter.<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** So whereever the treasure is in your primitive Earth hunt game here, you will also find all of her private communications...for months!<br />

**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Hopefully  I did not spoil your illusion. Surely I could pass for a Chef in one of these eateries?<br />
*Zehpr 'Chops' Megee looks around the room and takes an inventory*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** I had no idea you all had such interesting alter egos!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, uh, what happens with the non-prepared characters?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Anyone can enter the holodeck of course, but other characters in the simulation will not recognize them as pre-existing characters<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** So...Im not the best Oyster Chef in the Western Continent? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What will they recognize them as? Just a stranger in the casino? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Yes, just strangers<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Also, how do we obtain new goods? Do we need to purchase things? <br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Or can we simply fabricate things to a certain extent? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Ishemok's cover identity has access to a cuboid metallic storage device containing large quantities of the money used in this era<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** And Commander Skig's cover identity has this machine shop where she can fabricate difficult to obtain goods<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** I will gladly loan it out at affordable rates!<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** I will gladly loan it out at affordable rates!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Ishemok, you know that this is fake money, right? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But we must ensure that no 24th century technology is brought into the holodeck, or it will trigger the security code in the program and erase the quantum memory<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** If it can buy things, how is it fake?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is indeed quite fake<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** As is your body<br />
*Sam Mulloy looks deflated.*<br />
*Skig was going to say something, but the Twins' response was much better.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** However fake it may be, it will nonetheless be useful in executing this theft<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What...what is the security code? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do we need to enter the vault and retrieve an object?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh, right, what form does this object take?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can we just build a large mole-tunneling machine and just retrieve it?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not know, the holodeck simulation engine will attempt to interpret whatever data is there into a form that is appropriate given the simulation parameters<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Is there a time limit other than "Moment" before I write you up for the ODN circuit?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Hmmm. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can we heist a UFO from Area 51 and terrorize the locals?<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** I presume that would include the documents which Zox has installed?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Our journey to Starbase 17 will take a few days, so we have at least that long<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Can we borrow a nuclear bomber from Andrews AFB?<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Sam Mulloy): Wasn't this a DS9 Episodes where quark goes back to....</font><br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But we do not know what mission we will be assigned to after that rendezvous, it is possible that we will have to shut down the holodeck after that<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** If the program halts, Commander Zox's intelligence information will be erased<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Question, though: Would the oroboros virus also be given physical form? <br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We assume it would have to be<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Peachy<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** The data is here only.<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Only the data is here. <br />
*Skig froze for a second when she thought the twins were going to stop with "intelligence" in their last sentence, is happy 10 finished with "information will be erased".*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** As far as I know, this was the only way to save the data.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Then we have no choice but to steal it<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, I have information in my dossier about files on several missing persons. I'd like to visit my office to review these, because I don't think that your old room mate would have included them if they were totally irrelevant<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 take off their sunglasses so that they can put them back on dramatically again*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Correct. Even if you break whatever dull regulation governs the holodeck, that information is well worth it.<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Oh wait, you didn't disable the safety protcols? What sort of holodeck is this?!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, we didn't.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The safety protocols are active, however Hollis added code to the program to detect if we are killed in the simulation and terminate the program if that happens<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Oh, that's just unfun. It won't just boot one of us out? <br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Ah ha. Interesting conundrum!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Wait, so effectively we're all immortal except for you?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We suppose you could say that<br />
*Skig looks at Twins.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Make sure you stand behind Murry at all times, in case she blows up or starts shooting "near" you.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, Skig, what's your cover name? <br />
*Skig looks at datapad.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** I would advise stealth over force, simply because whatever form the data takes in quantum memory may have a very fragile projection here. Think glass sculpture or faberge egg. You may pierce the vault, but you have to escape with something fragile.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ida Bauers?<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Tracy Dixon, Private Investigator<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** How about you, Ishemok? <br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Im Crazy Mulloy, and I seel wheels! You need a new set right? No one gonna hire an investigator without some status ya know?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Step 1, we should case the joint in the most inconspicuous option, which is not to drive TEH Beast (gestures to what looks like a cobbled together tank) to the casino.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Malat? Who's your cover? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Step 2: After corroborating what the Twins have gathered, determine the plan of attack.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** My name is apparantly "Trixie" but if anyone calls me that, I'm going to break your nose<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** okay doll-face.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** What about your last name? <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** McAdams<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** What's your background? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Step 3: Zox creates a distraction by turning into Zox-zilla and rampaging through the Vegas Strip like a Kaiju in Tokyo.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I'm a member of something called a "Biker gang" and apparently have something called a "chopper"?<br />
*Zehpr 'Chops' Megee cries in dinosaur after remembering what happened the last time he tried to be a monster.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Step 4: We go snag the loot while the simulation sends in the army to fight Kaiju Zox.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I didn't do well in Earth history at the academy<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That is a motorcycle, Malat.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Hold on, let's head to the street to check this out<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** That is an interesting idea, however attempting to rewrite Zox into a giant monster would almost certainly trigger the security protocol and erase the system memory<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I think I have a ... yes, here, I have keys for something<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Ya know what Skig, that is a good plan, but I'm just too clumbsy in Kaiju form. Gotta worry about that data...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Step 5: I write up the Twins for disconnecting the ODN Circuit.<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. takes Malat down to check out their rides*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I might have made up some of that just to see if anyone was actually listening to me.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Oh, this is neat. A vintage gun<br />
>Murry and Malat find a powder blue 2-door convertible outside next to a Harley Davidson panhead with saddle bags<br />

**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Ah, now this is class<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** No, but weapons of this era do not have stun settings<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Darn straight!<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. is looking forward to when the other gang members call her "Trixie"*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** They can only be used on "kill"<br />

**Sam Mulloy:** I haven't seen many Earth movies, but I presume this machine shop is our hide out...We need a little more info before we make a real plan, no?<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Hmmm<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is not a criminal hideout, this is a reputable place of business.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Indeed, we found this book in the hotel room of our character when we first arrived<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Ah, jou mean it is time to cook a bit and see some of ze inner workings of ze casnio?<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 take out a pamphlet titled "Robbery for Dummies"*<br />
*Skig looks at the book.*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What does "Copyright 1984" mean, and who is "Ima Moron"? I'm not familiar with that author.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We believe this was a joke left by Hollis for us<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Makes sense.<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. pops back upstairs to check with the others*<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I'm going to go try and find my place of residence to get some documents on missing people, so I'll be back<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Yes, I believe back in Step 1 I suggested "case the joint" as we need to gather information, and it is not like I can use some AOL CDs in my Commodore 64 to find out some useful information from Myspace maps.<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Those CDs were later re-classified as personal shuruken once humanity forgot what a CD was...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I thought they were used to clean the inside of microwave ovens?<br />
**Zehpr 'Chops' Megee:** Earth was strange once we lefft it...<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Well, Thanks for being our bookie here, tellin us what the odds are here commanders<br />

*Lt. Malat hops onto the chopper and rides off*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** What were you expecting from Lt. Malat?<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Oh well, 'ill pick up a' couple a classy dames on the way<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** She has been charged with assaulting a fellow officer on four different occasions<br />

![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are Amand and Dino Cloutier, stage magicians currently headlining at the De Soto's Fortune <br />
**Sam Mulloy:** That's actually really good cover<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You can thank Hollis for that one, we chose all of your characters based on their access to useful resources and their similarity to your own personalities<br />

>INTERIOR - Machine Shop: The gang start to congregate back at the shop in the evening, Zox is now wearing an actual chef's outfit with the casino's logo on it. Murry seems drunk<br />

**Sam Mulloy:** Look what the cat dragged in! Murry, doll, I got something that will 'fix you right up, you can't heist like that!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This will cure everything.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I'm good for now, thank you. How connected is De Soto's Fortune with the Garbo Family? <br />
*Skig shakes a Pabst Blue Ribbon, points the top at Murry and pulls the cap off.*<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Oh wait,....yeah this isn't a good idea with violent types...<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Raimondo Garbo owns the casino<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Wait, is it beer before liquor or the other way around?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Not that this is beer.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** He is involved with an organization know as the "Cosa Nostra"<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Wait, it's fermented? I must try this!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, it is not fermented, more like kidney post processed.<br />
*Skig offers Murry a towel for the Pabst all over her face.*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Zis, zis is not fit to clean the counter much less cook! <br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I don't see how Murry could have gotten drunk, this is holographic liqour<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** I went drinking with some of the guards from the casino, and I don't feel a thing<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I only have 111 cans of beer in the fridge, take one out and spray it around, 110 cans of beer in the fridge.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We took the liberty of replicating genuine alcohol for the bottles in Mrs. Dixon's apartment<br />
*Skig is strangely lyrical and horribly off-key.*<br />
*Skig hands a can of Pabst to Zox.*<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** That's... kind of a dick move honestly<br />
*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee eats the entire can, not bothering to crack it open.*<br />
*Tracy Dixon, P.I. offers Malat one of her drinks*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Do you think you could do something with the carbonic acid and pressurization in these things?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Umm...nevermind.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Thanks Commander, I learned this from the guards at the casino<br />
*Lt. Malat takes out a large knife, stabs a hole in the bottom of the can, then opens the other end and rapidly drinks the entire thing*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Hrm, not nearly strong enough. <br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Yikes!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Humans should be ashamed they ever marketed this stuff to anything. But enough about this swill.<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** Anyways, I learned from the guards that there is some kind of "social club" in the lower east wing of the casino<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** It doesn't have access to the vault, but it runs parallel to it<br />
![](../images/malat.png)**Lt. Malat:** They kept trying to invite me, although I'm pretty sure they're trying to recruit me into some sort of sex work.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Fascinating, we were able to access a highly secured area of the casino<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Huh, how'd you get in? <br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Pure magic, that Dino is!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** After our success at the Blackjack tables, two gentlemen put a burlap sack over our heads and lead us down an elevator and into a room in the basement<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** They said they didn't want to break our "magic fingers<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** because we brought in revenue for the casino<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** However, if we ever played blackjack again, they would break our knees with a hammer<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ballpin or claw?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** But, our internal positional sensor was able to track our movement despite the burlap sack, and we are able to ascertain that the room where they took us is within the secure area of the casino<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We are not sure, we are not that familiar with varietals of hammer<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The claw would have been useful if you could have brought it back with you.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** I don't think they were in a position to actually take anything back with them<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Is you thinkin, that we should get caught again and ambush the guards when we are questioned again?<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** How are we going to ambush the guards if we're the ones who are caught? <br />
**Sam Mulloy:** maybe Skig, Ida? you can hack the cameras and put em on loop?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Unfortunately, in this era computerized technology was not yet widely adopted<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The surveillance cameras in the casino are directly hard-wired to video recorders in 2 different security rooms<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** You are thinking too advanced for the technology of this period.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The only way to disable all of the cameras would be from within those rooms, by unhooking them from something called a "Betamax"<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Isn't that a type of fish native to Regulus 4?<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ne'var forget, zat ze Chef is always ze most dangerous mem'ber of ze team. <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Why is there a fish in the security rooms?<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not know, this period of Earth's history is very unusual<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Or perhaps I'm thinking of a Bettamax?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** One of those is a recording device, the other is a large fish.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So I've discovered that a young woman, Briley Marijn, was working as a legal secretary for a lawyer named Beppe Renzo. He is a consigliere for the Garbo family, who apparently came to threaten me last time my character looked into them. She's since gone missing, her family hired Tracy to look into it. <br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Hrm.....<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Malat should go with those guards to see if she can find your missing person, or we have Zox check the freezer.<br />
**Shadowy Woman:** Don't tell me you're going to a party and I wasn't invited?<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Who...?<br />
>A sultry voice rings out from the shadows, as a woman no one saw enter is standing in a dark corner<br />

*Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee guffaws as someone sneaks up on the steely detective*<br />
>As she goes to light her cigarette, it illuminates her face you can recognize her<br />

**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** The invitation was subtle, was it not...Bachar? <br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** You probably should have told me once Zox dumped Jasanis' messages into that vault<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** But I did warn you before: Not a damn thing happens on this ship that I don't know about<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** It was news to the rest of us.<br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** Except Zox, who is a master of espionage <br />
**Tracy Dixon, P.I.:** So tight lipped he doesn't let even a whisper slip<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Forgive me comman'ndar, it just happened as I a'ceessed ze PADD. Zere was no way of knowing just how spicy ze data would be<br />
*Skig makes a mental note to due a ship-wide internal security electrical purge of all nonessential devices to turn off electronic eavesdropping.*<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** I don't have any concrete details, but the holodecks are going to be shut down in 3 days as part of our new assignment<br />
*Skig cancels that plan when she remembers what happened the last time she shorted out Kolea's "electronics".*<br />
**Zehpr 'Shucks' Megee:** Ze Jasanis is wiley.<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** So this isn't strictly a game anymore, if we don't pull this off quick and clean, that data is gone forever<br />
![](../images/bachar.png)**Cmdr Bachar:** And you look like you could use the help<br />
