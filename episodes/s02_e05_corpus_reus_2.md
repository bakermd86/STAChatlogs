>INTERIOR - Kolaakor's Office: Kolea fumbles blindly through the thick gray clouds of gas and smoke now filling the junk dealer's front office. Loose junk clatters loudly to the deck as her hands clumsily reach for anything she can use to orient herself in the maze of old ship parts. She fights to keep her eyes open despite both the burning pain of the chemical irritants, and the effect of the sedatives she now clearly feels.<br />

>Before she can find her way out, she falls to the deck. The next thing she knows, Nurse Krepeka and Lt. Commander Viraseti are trying to help her to her feet, as her legs refuse to cooperate and stay underneath her. She looks around to see an away team from the Lister, who came in response to her distress call.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** That was unfortunate.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** How is Kolaakor?<br />
>Kolaakor's office appears to have been drained of water, his lifeless body is crumpled on the deck slowly desicating<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** That's a bad sign.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Immediate suspicion would be, "covering loose ends in the event the Lister appeared here". Kolaakor has a rather intense surveillance suite here, so if someone is watching us, they had to hack through it or around it.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Oh interesting. We should check out shuttle bay; he may have picked up some drifters.<br />
>At Zox's suggestion, Malat takes point and heads to the shuttle bay. When she opens the door and heads in, the away team sees an escape pod that appears to have come from a Constitution refit class starship<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Damn it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Eh?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I think they were stowed on our own ship, have the Lister run a scan to see if any of our escape pods were fired<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I see.<br />
**Hailey Murry ** *(via comms)*: Hailey to Lister, can you run a scan to see whether we're missing any escape pods, and who or what got in them recently?<br />
**Redshirt** Oh hey, how about that. You're right ma'am. It looks like an escape pod is missing from deck 6<br />
*Kolea sighs in annoyance for no explicable reason.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Kolea): ...because she is not there to learn this...</font><br />
**Kolea:  [2d100 = 13]**<br />
**Hailey Murry ** *(via comms)*: Check the cameras, I want to know who was traveling through that area recently<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Really?<br />
*Kolea heads to the escape pods area to see if an escape pod is actually physically missing.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Wow, this is super scary. It seems like this ship is always being infiltrated by spys and bad guys of some kind, huh? I am not an expert, I never took counter-intelligence at the academy, but it really seems like maybe there is a broader structural failing in the security aparatus on board the ship. I mean, at the Academy they talk a lot about how starship crews are like a family and the trust and collaboration required for a Starfleet vessel to operate smoothly. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Anyways, I reviewed the footage but it doesn't seem like there is anyone unexpected in that area. We don't have direct camera coverage of that hatch itself, but in all of the footage from the surrounding areas I only see medical personel like Kolea and Krepeka, which you would kind of expect since it is right next to main sickbay.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Viraseti, can you scan for any ion signatures indicating a quick get-away by some sort of criminal here?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I'll need to return to the Lister, stand by.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Murry, check for your local unfriendly Jem'Hadar who was thawed from stasis and has been sent over there, but somehow was hibernating on the Lister.<br />
*Lt. Cmdr Viraseti tranports back to the Lister and heads to the bridge to run a scan*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** No recent ion signatures or warp signatures in the area, apart from our own. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Also, the escape pod launch tube has been resealed, which indicates that someone else on the Lister closed the escape pod hatch to cover their tracks.<br />

The Seventh Gaurantee of the Federation constitution clearly protects the rights of accused not to answer questions or assist investigators. It is kind of one of the core legal rights of the Federation. You know?<br />

>Windbloom retraces Tal'oran's steps and finds her still attached to the hull, slowly dying in the vacuum of space. Knowing that his superior Jem'Hadar biology allows him to survive in a state of hibernation in the vacuum of space for quite some time, he takes one last toke of his infuser and takes off his helmet. He pops something into Tal'oran's mouth, and puts the helmet on her head.<br />
