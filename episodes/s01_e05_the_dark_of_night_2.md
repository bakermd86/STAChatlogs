>INTERIOR - Taganite Freighter: Zox clings to the limp body of the Taganite who charged at him and collapsed in his arms, Dr. Zerra takes out his medical tricorder to check on him, as Commander Skig had ordered<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am not an expert in Taganite physiology, but it seems that his neural patterns are scrambling the medical tricorder. I'm not able to get any coherent readings of his brain activity<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** His heart is still beating, but his physical condition implies some neurological issue that the tricorder can't pinpoint<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, requesting permission to beam one back to sick bay!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... Dr. Zerra, analysis?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** There is still a second lifeform, about 60 meters from here<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I am not sure about the risk to the ship by beaming a lifeform to the Lister when we are unsure of the necessary containment protocols.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have every faith in your quartantine buffers and fields.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I would prefer not to give Hailey an excuse to blow more holes in the Lister.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Very well<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** We could have Kolea put him in an induced coma in a level four containment field<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** If you feel that is safe doctor, then I agree.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** To stablize his condition until we are able to analyze further<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It should be safe as long as she doesn't roll any complications<br />
*Zox leaves the Taganite to Dr. Zerra and moves 55 meters in the suggested direction.*<br />
*Skig orders Kolea to perform the necessary actions to meet Dr. Zerra's recommendations and beam the Taganite over.*<br />

**Kolea:** I seem to have chipped a nail on the containment field settings, Skig, can you send someone from engineering over to fix the panel?<br />

>Dr Zerra leads Zox in the direction of the lifesign his tricorder is reading. As they traverse the ship, they find several more Taganite bodies strewn about the deck, with a variety of apparent causes of death<br />

>Toward the aft of the ship, they find a sealed room labeled "Brig"<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The lifesign I'm reading is just inside there<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Perhaps being in the brig saved them from whatever malady impacted the rest of the crew?<br />
*Zox rolls up his sleves, then flexes to tear his uniform in half.*<br />
*Zox Pops open a can of Jurrasic Spinach and eats.*<br />
**Kurij:** Tactical Officer, it looks like half of them suffocated. The other half were beaten. And stabbed. And zapped<br />

>Zox uses the power cell from his phaser to restore power to the brig door and open it up. When it opens, the crew sees a Starfleet office laying immobile on the bench in one of the cells (which is now open due to the power loss)<br />

**Kurij:** I'm pretty sure I watched a movie about this in the past<br />
*Zox St. Bernard here, complete with whiskey keg.*<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I don't know how she's still alive, but her brain function seems in-tact<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** She should be dead with these life signs<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Check to see this is really a Bolian.<br />
**Kurij:** It looks like she was being held prisoner<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm...<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Genetic profile is clearly Bolian, her condition is a mystery...<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I have a supposition this officer was captured by the Taganite freighter for "salvage" and has some sort of malady that spread to the rest of the crew.<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Hey Kurij, can I borrow your Tricorder?<br />
**Kurij:** Borrow with intention to...?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Dr Zerra, I have setup a containment field to preserve her in her current state for evaluation. As we have accounted for both life signs, if Kurij and Dr Zerra can continue to evaluate the Bolian officer here, Zox, can you determine her identity and pull her officer records to determine how she came to be on this ship. I will head to engineering to see about restoring power to the ships.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** To save more lives. Im 2 lives for 2 devices so far.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** That's pretty good no?<br />

**Kurij:** Got it!<br />

*Zox calmly points the phaser at the ground, turns the safety back on,  and hands it back to Kurij following all firearm safety protocols.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** And give me back my tricorder<br />
*Kurij takes it back and puts it back in the holster*<br />
**Kurij:** Thank you for not murdering all of us<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I see things are as perfectly normal here.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Okay here is your tricorder Dr.<br />
*Dr. Zerra takes back the tricorder and begins to scan Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I have no idea how these things changed places<br />
**Kurij:** Lt Commander Skig, I think there may be some sort of cognito hazard on board that's interfering with behavior or memory. It would explain why it looks like the bodies in the hallway killed each other<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ship's power has been restored.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Ah yes, that would explain the Taganite I found folded in half that was gumming up the transpositronic relay on deck 3.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I think the only thing you'll find, is that im a little saurus.<br />
**Kurij:** Oof, that doesn't sound healthy<br />
**Kurij:** You are a large saurus<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Indeed, although I suspect the cause of death was likely the sawblade bissecting his head. Brain matter is so messy on electrical circuits.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am not reading anything unusual in Zox's brain activity, but the tricorder is limited. We need to get him to sickbay on the lister and do a full neurological workup<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Either that or a court marshal<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... should we scan Hailey for Voth Eggs again?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** But for the moment, I'm willing to entertain a medical explanation for his behavior<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: martial*</font><br />
*Zox is dumbfounded.*<br />
<font color="#005500">GM: Not marshal</font><br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I couldn't hurt, no telling what he has been up to<br />
**Kurij:** If we've got the ship up, we should check the logs but try to minimize exposure to them<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Very well, Dr. do you believe you have gathered enough information that you feel comfortable with the situation here and would be willing to take Zox back to the Lister for further evaluation while Kurij and I check out the cargo bay?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's obvious this place made a whole crew lose decades of discipline and training, but you think the problem is limited to my psychology. Hrm.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Aye ma'am<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** We have full, unfettered access to the logs for review.<br />
**Kurij:** Are we in any hurry to get off the ship? We could look into it first, then if it looks clear transport back<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** True, let's check out the cargo bay as a group, then return collectively to the Lister for evaluation.<br />
*Skig heads to the cargo bay with the rest of the Away Team following along dutifully behind.*<br />
*Dr. Zerra keeps an eye on Zox as the away team heads to check out the cargo bay*<br />
*Zox follows his commanding officer.*<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Right Zox?  Following along? Right?</font><br />
>The ship is much less spooky with the lights back on, although the dead bodies strewn across the deck still unnerve everyone except Skig<br />

*Skig steps over or on bodies as if they are not there, whistling happy to herself about how much this reminds her of times on her family's freighter when she was growing up.*<br />
**Kurij:** So the Bolian looked like she should be dead, right?<br />
**Kurij:** And these bodies also look like they're supposed to be dead<br />
**Kurij:** Can we, I dunno, scan a couple to make sure? <br />
>Skig and Zox lead the away team through the ship to the main cargo bay, when they get there, they find that the door has been welded shut by a phaser.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This looks like a situation best resolved with brute strength.<br />
*Skig goes to find the alternate Jeffries Tube entrance to the cargo bay while Zox tries to tear the door open.*<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Quite dead, the Bolian officer was alive despite her vitals being... bizzare, but these bodies have no life signs at all. And given the visible signs of decay, I imagine it would smell... very ripe if we took off these EVA suits<br />

>With the door open the away team can see the salvage laid out on the deck below the catwalk. A warp core, a computer core, several pulse phaser emiitters, an ablative armor generator, 2 quantum torpedo emitters, and numerous smaller items<br />

**Kurij:** We appreciate the hard work, Lt Commander<br />
