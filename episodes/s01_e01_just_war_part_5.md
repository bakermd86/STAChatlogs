>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: The away team were fighting off an attack by the Osalans, and seemed to have things well in hand. But unfortunately, Crewman Burkett got too enthusiastic and ended up stuck like a pig.<br />

**Hailey Murry:  [3d6 = 6]**<br />
**Zox:** Remember to take some as hostages!<br />
**Zox:** They have some of ours!<br />
*Kurij fires her phaser at the spear-holding warrior, striking him square in the forehead and stunning him back into the river*<br />
>Kurij stuns the nearest osalan with an expertly placed phaser shot<br />

**Kurij:** Get away from him, you uncivilized loaf!<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** They have particle weapons! Call for reinforcements!<br />
*Osalan Soldier takes out a big horn and begins blowing into it*<br />
*Kolea runs forward and retrieves Burkett's gene seed for the Chapter.*<br />
**Kolea:** Wait... wrong game.<br />
*Kolea runs forward and attempts to stabilize Burkett by using his inflation tube and blowing mightily on it.*<br />
**Kolea:** Wait... wrong genre of Star Trek.<br />
*Kolea runs forward and attempts to render medical assistance to crewman Burkett.*<br />
**Kurij:** If you want to blow something, confiscate that guy's horn!<br />
**Kolea: [ DARING  (8) +  MEDICINE  (4)]

**Kolea:** Eww... who knows where that horn has been.  Has it been sanitized?<br />
<font color="##005500">indarien: Momentum</font><br />
**Crewman Burkett:** I don't know what was in that hypospray, but I feel like a million bars of Latinum<br />
*Crewman Burkett springs back to his feet*<br />
**Kolea:** Extra Orion Love Potion.<br />
*Zox suddenly feels unworthy without a horn.*<br />
*Kolea is relatively certain the censors would faint at her first three responses to that.*<br />
>Three more Osalans come out of the trees and hurls spears across the river at Kurij and Zox. One misses, but the others strike their targets<br />

<font color="##005500">Feneril: 3 stress on Kurij and 2 on Zox, no injuries</font><br />
>[ROUND 2]<br />

>[TURN] Osalan Soldier 14<br />

**Skig: [ CONTROL  (11) +  COMMAND  (1)]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [d20 = 9]**<br />
**Skig:** Lt Malat, target the far side of the bank with a dispersion phaser blast set to the lowest setting and drive the Osalans back from the away team.<br />
**Skig:** Something along the lines of, "gentle tanning booth" as opposed to "deep fat fry" on the phaser array.<br />
>The sky lights up with a hot orange glow for a split second before a wide beam phaser breaks through the clouds and bathes the far bank of the river in energy<br />

**Zox:  [Damage: 8] [Effects: 2] [8dChallenge = 8]**<br />
*Skig gains new focus, "Close orbital fire support in combat settings".*<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  MEDICINE  (1)]
[Focus: Xenobiology ]
[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 21]**<br />
**Kolea:** Well, that was anti-climatic.  Kind of like what happens with older human males around me.<br />
*Kolea gets slapped by the censors, again.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Commander, I think that may have been overkill<br />
**Kurij:** I'm not sure if a giant beam of death from above is "anti-climatic"<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Also, we need to get out of here<br />
**Kurij:** Hold on!<br />
**Commander Bachar:** That beam will give our position away to both factions<br />
**Commander Bachar:** This position is going to be overrun in minutes<br />
**Skig:** Understood, we can evacuate you via transport beams with the arrays setup and plan where to move next to recover our people.<br />
*Kurij flips over the dude she knocked out earlier as she runs past to grab the horn*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I'm not leaving the surface without the captain<br />
**Kurij:** Do we have enough space to keep our prisoners on the ship? <br />
**Skig:** Lt Malat, Bynars, monitor the area for incoming hostiles and work out a firing pattern to keep the area clear of hostiles.<br />
**Zox:** Kolea, can you apply some stimulants to one of these stunned humanoids? We need information. Fast.<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Sensors are reading large numbers of Osalan bio signatures moving towards the Commander's position, interference is making it impossible to pinpoint exact locations<br />
**Skig:** Very well, we can ready the phaser bank to keep them away from the Commander and the Away team.<br />
**Kolea:** Absolutely.<br />
*Kolea goes to guy #12 (who had the horn and must therefore be in charge) and resuscitates him in a perfectly normal medical way, so she doesn't get slapped by the censors again.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Belay that order Lieutenants, there are thousands of Osalans on this planet, one mistake and you'd risk a blood bath<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Not to mention that they are still holding our crew<br />
*Skig sends Malat a message in Signal, "So, can we recalibrate the phaser bank to only hit whatever species Commander Bachar is?"*<br />
*Kurij keeps an eye out for incoming Osalans*<br />
**Zox: [ PRESENCE  (10) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Focus: Espionage ]
[Successes: 3] [Complications: 0]
Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 13]**<br />
*Kolea makes sure none of the stunned Osalans are at immediate risk of drowning in the water.*<br />
**Zox:** Dominant Osalan with horn; where are the prisoners?<br />
*Kolea checks to see how stunned the plants are.*<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** Oh gods, are you going to eat me?<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** Don't eat me! Loris has some of them in his crawler, I don't know where the Northern Front are keeping their prisoners<br />
*Zox shows all of his many teeth (they are flatt and clearly for eating vegetable matter, but let's see how smart this mook is)*<br />
**Zox:** Very well. Where is this crawler?<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** I don't know exactly where, but it's on its way now<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** Loris will want your particle weapons<br />
**Zox:** Thank you much. You and your herd will be spared, dominant horn one.<br />
**Zox:** You will be treated well.<br />
**Zox:** Take em all to the brig!<br />
**Kurij ***(To Kolea)*: We've got to teach Zox to call the Brig "the pantry"<br />
**Kurij: [ INSIGHT  (10) +  ENGINEERING  (2)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 21]**<br />
**Zox: [ INSIGHT  (8) +  ENGINEERING  (3)]

**Kolea: [ INSIGHT  (11) +  ENGINEERING  (2)]
[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]
Failed on DC: 1 [2d20 = 35]**<br />
*Kolea Agrees with Kurij, although she was confused what she meant at first as she thought "Brig" was what humans referred to as, "Love Hotel of Happy Fun Time."*<br />
**Kurij:** We've got a very big thing incoming, we've got to get out of here. I don't think the phaser will work on this<br />
**Kurij:** Massive tank or something<br />
**Kurij:** Probably the crawler<br />
*Osalan Soldier laughs*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Zox, beam up the wounded and the prisoners. We need to get out of here.<br />
**Zox:** Very well.<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 14]**<br />
*Kolea helps Zox get the wounded into position so they can be beamed up.*<br />
*Kolea gives Crewman Burkett her business card for her massage therapy operation before he beams up.*<br />
>As the last of the wounded and the prisoners are beamed up, a massive black shape begins to crest the hills to the south. It looks like a block of apartments on treads, its exterior is covered in a patchwork of different types of armor plating, and it seems to be covered in decades upon decades of filth<br />

*Skig arranges for the Osalans to be moved to the Brig after being checked for harmful bacteria and viruses.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** What the hell...<br />
**Osalan Soldier:** You wanted to know where your people were<br />
**Kurij:** I'm not sure whether to feel disgusted at the condition of that or in awe at the fact that they've kept it going<br />
**Skig:** Well, conviently, using the phaser bank on the ship might have brought both factions together so our shipboard Counselor can negotiate a truce with both sides.  Or create the complication of uniting both sides against us.<br />
**Kolea:** I feel like I need a tetanus booster being on the same planet as that object.<br />
>As if to punctuate Skig's prescience, a similar looking structure begins to crest the hills from the north. <br />

>---------CUT TO COMMERCIAL-------<br />

>EXTERIOR - Planet Surface: The away team are debating what to do about the two massive mobile structures that have now surrounded them<br />

**Commander Bachar:** Suggestions.<br />
**Zox:** Skig, those ramshackle contraptions look to be made from real Osalan tech, Can we not EMP them both to prevent a bloody conflict?<br />
*Commander Bachar opens comms to the ship so the entire senior staff can contribute*<br />
*Skig gets called off stage as the screen writers go into apoplectic fits because they created seven different scenes to handle all the long complex negotations and that was all boiled into the water when she ad-libbed using the phaser banks on the attacking soldiers.*<br />
*Skig scratches her head and wonders where JJ Abrams is.*<br />
**Kurij:** There's no way they haven't conflicted before<br />
*Skig returns to the bridge.*<br />
**Skig:** It might be possible to modulate the phaser banks or use the sensor arrays to disrupt their electrical systems.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** I recommend we let them kill each other, use the chaos to send in a small covert force with transporter enhancers to rescue our crew<br />
**Kurij:** If they kill each other, they may kill the captives <br />
*Skig brings up the schematics for Ork WarWagons and looks at different ways to use Adeptus Mechanicus Pulse Weapons.*<br />
*Skig closes that Codex, gets out her Starfleet Manual.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Their technology is centuries old, it should be a simple matter to disable these vehicles if needed<br />
**Zox:** Sounds like a plan to me.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Good luck disabling their spears and bows and arrows<br />
**Skig:** I agree, we should be able to disable their vehicles if they engage in hostilities towards the away team.<br />
**Skig:** However, this does not stop them from stabbing the away team or killing the captives.<br />
**Dr. Zerra:** Their may be a diplomatic solution, have we tried hailing them?<br />
**Skig:** Right, have they engaged in any hostilities or opened communications with them?<br />
**Zox:** Do we have a lock on any com badges eminating from the crawlers?<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** There are large energy signatures consisted with starfleet commbadges, but the intereference from the warp bubble is preventing us from obtaining a transporter lock<br />
**Skig:** We are operating from a position of strength in that they know we have superior technology and have used it already. They will demand this technology in exchange for freeing the captives. Obviously the Prime Directive prohibits this response.<br />
*Skig looks at Murry.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Agreed, we can't give these people access to phasers<br />
**Commander Bachar:** They have been killing each other in here for 100 years, the last thing they need is more advanced weapons<br />
**Skig:** Perhaps we can find out what they want, and negotiate some palatable solution where they are each given half of some more advanced medical/life preserving technology and taught they need to work together to make the best use of it?<br />
**Hailey Murry:** We also have prisoners from the Osalans. We should hail them first, and we may be able to get them on board with a full rescue.<br />
**Skig:** Or perhaps something agricultural.<br />
**Zox:** I like the idea of hailing first. We have enough prisoners to negotiate for whatever Starfleet was captured by either side.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Sounds like the best plan we have. <br />
**Skig:** Okay, let's hail one or both sides, if they do not have communications capable equipment, is it conventional "wave the white flag and invite them over for tea?"<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Skig, I want you and the twins to start working on escape plan in the meantime. I don't want to spend my golden years in this... whatever it is<br />
**Zox:** What if we just made it rain sufficiently to disable their crawlers?<br />
**Skig:** Pocket Dimension created by the Traveler to preserve the inhabitants of the valley from the orbital bombardment that destroyed the city that was imprisoning him.  At least, that is the current working theory.<br />
**Commander Bachar:** Murry, see if you can make contact via the comms. Zox and I will take the security team and move in covertly. If negotiations fail, I want a backup<br />
*Zox 's skin flushes a red, aggressive color.*<br />
*Skig begins working with the Bynars on a "escape the warp bubble" plan using the satellite array point as where to focus a warp field inversion event.*<br />
**Commander Bachar:** I'm not sure if that is a "Yes I Agree" color, or a "I hope it doesn't come to that" color<br />
**Zox:** Oh I agree. <br />
**Kolea:** I took it as, "I love a female who gives me aggressive orders and assumes a dominant position."<br />
*Hailey Murry begins working on establishing communication*<br />
**Zox:** It might be that too<br />
**Hailey Murry:** 11, 10, can you get us connected with them to begin negotiation? <br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Aye sir<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Hailing frequencies open<br />
*Zox Looks to Hailey, anticipating a swift resolution and successful negotiations.*<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 looks at Commander Murry, waiting for her to speak*<br />
*Zox begins to wonder if Hailey is feeling ok...*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** Good day, sirs and madams. We're reaching out to you from the Starship USS Lister from the Federation. We're under the impression that some of our crew, who went missing within the last few days, have been kindly taken under your wing. We would like to discuss their return. Please respond so we can parlay. <br />
*Skig offers slow clap of respect for Murry's opening speech.*<br />
>Several moments of silence pass before a robust chorus of laughter erupts from the comms<br />

**Loris Vaah:** My men said the old gods brought fire from the sky! You sound like a frightened child!<br />
*Skig works out a firing solution for a photon torpedo that will hit the upper atmosphere and create an "aurora borealis of red death" effect without actually bringing harm to the people on the surface. *<br />
**Hailey Murry:** I see, I'm sorry to hear that. If you're unwilling to discuss negotiations, I suppose we'll have to discuss it with your peers. <br />
**Loris Vaah:** I have your people, some of them at least. I am Loris Vaah, supreme leader of the Central Republic<br />
**Loris Vaah:** I would be glad to return your people, but as a show of good faith, why don't you use that sky fire to eliminate a thorn in my side<br />
>Another voice bursts into laughter over he comms<br />

**Korok Avera:** Hah! Asking some little girl to do your dirty work Loris?<br />
**Korok Avera:** You've been trying to kill me for 40 years, now you think some space-child is going to do it?<br />
**Skig:** Murry, can you go to Briefing Room 2 and prepare to meet our guests?<br />
**Skig:** I need a security detail with phasers to join Murry in Briefing Room 2.<br />
**Hailey Murry ***(away from the mic)*: Are we going to end the discussion here or would someone like to take over?<br />
**Loris Vaah:** I would kill you in a day if you ever came out of your crawler Korok!<br />
**Skig:** Murry, I believe communications in person are the best way solve this problem.<br />
**Lt. Malat:** That should be fun<br />
**Lt. Malat:** 2-weeks of holodeck rations says they kill each other before Murry can get a word in<br />
**Lt. Malat:** Any takers?<br />

>Skig and the Bynars are able to piggy-back on the comm signals from Korok and Loris to cut through the interference and obtain a transporter lock on Loris and Korok. Skig energizes the transporter...<br />

>Unfortunately, Skig forgot to enage the weapon screen during rematerialization, so Loris and Korok materialize in the briefing room still armed<br />

>Murry acts quickly while Loris is still getting his bearings from the beam-in and tackles him to the ground, going for his knife<br />

*Lt. Malat , lacking Murry's finnese, shoots Korok with a phaser on a low-stun setting*<br />
>Korok goes for Malat's phaser, but isn't able to overpower her<br />

>Finally, Burkett and McAllister are able to wrestle the much larger Korok to the ground and rip his blade from his hand<br />

**Lt. Malat:** Well, that was exciting<br />
**Hailey Murry:** I'll take...that<br />
*Korok Avera laughs*<br />
*Hailey Murry wrests the knife from Loris's grip*<br />
**Korok Avera:** It took three of them to best me Loris, and you couldn't even handle one little girl!<br />
**Korok Avera:** My poets will sing songs of your defeat for years!<br />
*Korok Avera laughs heartily*<br />
*Loris Vaah stands up and brushes himself off*<br />
**Loris Vaah:** Where are we?<br />
**Loris Vaah:** How have you captured us?<br />
*Hailey Murry brushes herself off as well, a bit flushed in the face*<br />
**Hailey Murry:** We captured you with more ease than I suspect you captured our crew. <br />
**Korok Avera:** More of their "sky god" technology <br />
**Korok Avera:** You and your silly superstitions<br />
**Loris Vaah:** It is no matter, kill me if you want, but my men will surely kill your crew within the hour.<br />
**Loris Vaah:** Unless I am returned<br />
**Korok Avera:** No doubt my men will do the same<br />
*Skig makes note, "Get crew back in exchange for leadership hostages we just acquired."*<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Commanders, I have noted something... troubling<br />
*Skig gives self invisible high-five for unplanned additional options to resolve crisis.*<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** In the past few minutes, it appears this bubble dimension has begun to shrink<br />
**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** At its current rate, we will ALL be dead within a few hours<br />
**Skig:** The Traveller is departing and taking his home with him.<br />
