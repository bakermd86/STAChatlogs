>INTERIOR - Casino Floor: As Trixie McAdams crashes her chopper into the casino bar, she and Sam Mulloy are flung from the saddle into the well of the bar. As they take cover behind the mahogany cabinets, dozens of casino security guards take up cover around their position. The patter of their footsteps drowned out by the ring of the fire alarms from the kitchen, and the screams of casino patrons fleeing the chaos.<br />

>Ishemok knows that he and the Twins have previously bribed several of the gaurds, so he pops up to spring his plan<br />

>Sadly, it seems the guards were all-to-happy to take their money, but not-so-happy to risk their lives betraying a mob family <br />

**Sam Mulloy:** Hey Pals! Nice of ya ta drop by!<br />
**Sam Mulloy:** Don't tell me ya don't remember yo' old buddy Sam?<br />
>The guards open fire and Ishemok and Malat have to duck for cover and return fire<br />

>Sam pops up to the grenade, and gets shot in the chest. The grenade bounces off the top of the bar and explodes in the middle of the casino floor, several guards are injured but the explosion takes out both Trixie and Sam. The holodeck engages the transporters to beam Lt. Malat back out into the adjacent corridor, while Ishemok finds himself back in the computer memory banks<br />

>INTERIOR - Casino Basement: T'Kor and Kolea watch Giuseppe dragged up the stairs by his guards before turning their attention to blasting the common wall. Skig wanders down the stairs in her firefighting costume just as Kolea is removing the plastic explosives from her bra.<br />

**"Bubbles" (Kolea):** I get to blow a wall?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Down Kolea!<br />
*Skig sprays Kolea with some water from a firehose to cool her down.*<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Good evening, Skig!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** How are things going down here T'Kor?<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** Fairly well, I believe that was the last of the security<br />
**Pennington (T'kor):** They're happy to get out of here first<br />
*Skig takes explosices from Kolea, plants and and detonates things, creating requisite hole, likely knocking down part of the casino and killing everyone when she gets complications.*<br />

>Skig carefully sets up the charges and then steps around the corner to detonate them. As the smoke from the blast clears, Skig can see that she misjudged the charge placement. They have opened a hole in the common wall, but it is too small to fit through<br />

>Commander Bachar, Throk and the Twins approach from the other side<br />

>Zox and Throk hurl their bodies repeatedly at the small opening, knocking loose bits of concrete away and bending back exposed rebar. Eventually, they open it just enough that Skig and Kolea can fit through without much trouble. <br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** Skig: the time lock disengages in 30 seconds<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Get your drill ready<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Would it be prudent for us to take cover before she activates it?<br />
*Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux begins making statue-esque poses, flaunting his taut, reptilitan musculature.*<br />
*Skig thinks that Bachar has encouraged her to consider other people's lives before she does something that will get them killed.*<br />

>As the timelock disengages, the lockout on the combintation pops open. Wasting no time, Skig immediately sets to work drilling through the combination panel and the interior locking mechanism, allowing the lock to pop open <br />

**Pennington (T'kor):** Well, that went smoothly!<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Pepe 'Souffle' Zoxoiux:** Ignatius, Let us do some pre-workout STRETCHES so we can carry the treasure!<br />
>Zox and Throk pull the heavy vault door open, revealing a room full of large sacks of money lining shelves spread around the room<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Indeed, better than expected. That was excellent use of your physiology to apply extra heat and torsion to the cross section there.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Next time Starfleet thinks you are alive and I need to write a performance review, I will include creative thinking in your behaviour profile.<br />
>Each sack has a label tied around the top, with a "Date", "Subject", "From" and "To" field written on them<br />

<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Bachar has foreseen this, and arranged to have wheels installed on the bottom of the bags so we can speed roll them along the floor.</font><br />
>As the away team look at the bags, a familiar looking bajoran wearing a casino guard uniform stolls around the corner<br />

**Kosal Oram:** Sorry I'm late, took me a little while to network my holodeck to yours<br />
**Hadija Zawadi:** Glad you could join us afterall<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** So you going to shoot us or help us get some of these combustibles out of the area?<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** Maybe I do both<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** For order of operations, you should do the "help us get the combustibles out" unless you fancy a pyromantic grave.<br />
*Casimiro Motta scowls and grumbles at Skig*<br />
*Casimiro Motta points to several mobsters*<br />
**Casimiro Motta:** You, you and you, get down there and take out whatever combustibles this bitch is talkin' about<br />
*"Bubbles" (Kolea) is mildly in awe of the fact that Skig didn't just have Throk tear the guys arms' off.*<br />

**Hadija Zawadi:** Commander, did it not occur to you to mention this before now?<br />
