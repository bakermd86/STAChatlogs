>INTERIOR - Holodeck: A mix of humans and Pelarians mill about in various full-body Pokemon costumes as the speakers blare loud techno music. A large banner on one end of the hall reads "Nixon / Ford '68" while another reads "Nixon's the one!"<br />

>Captain Bachar stares in disbelief next to the Pelarian priestess, and then grows a second pair of eyes on the back of her head with which to glare angrily at Darish and Gra'lan behind the priestess' back. A second mouth forms and silently mouths: "DO SOMETHING"<br />

>INTERIOR - Delta Flyer: Ghex, Zox, Geret, Viraseti and Kolea look up outside the front window as Ghex brings the flyer to a stop. In front of them, the roiling, churning violent plasma storms of the Badlands stretch into the distance. Ghex seems hesitant about flying into it.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** A few hours in the Badlands is a long time. It's your call sir, but navigating the Badlands can be like... SUPER sketchy. I did do one holodeck training excercise at the academy that simulated navigation in the badlands, but that didn't go quite as well as you might think given how good I usually was at the academy. I mean, we did technically survive the excercise, but I would NOT have wanted to be cleaning up the panels in that shuttle after. If it had been a real shuttle that is, I think the holodeck is self cleaning and it can reclaim the matter from vomit when the program is ended...<br />

<img src="../images/auto/vedek.png" alt="Vedek Ojun" width="50" height="50">**Vedek Ojun** The Cardassians stole all but one of the orbs when they occupied and pillaged our world.

<img src="../images/auto/vedek.png" alt="Vedek Ojun" width="50" height="50">**Vedek Ojun** I suppose that vessel crashed here.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Greetings Starfleet vessel, I am Gul Bemek of the CDS Laceil <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I come in peace, I am merely responding to an automated distress beacon <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** It is an old beacon, but it was reactivated from standby a short while ago when it detected a power surge from a transporter<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Greetings Gul Bemek, I am First Officer Skig of the USS Lister. We are here on our own mission, but for the purposes of cooperation we are happy to assist you if possible.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Yes, we spotted some wreckage from a crashed ship on the planet, but have not yet had the opportunity to investigate it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I am glad to hear that, because my sensor scans indicate that you may have conducted an illegal salvage operation of one of our vessels.<br />
*Skig makes hand signal to Bachar that translates to, "Vedek Dude probably wants to GTFO".*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I am sure that this was merely done in error, so I am happy to simply take possession of the illegally collected salvage and you may return without hostility to Federation space.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** As you are, no doubt, aware: Under Appendix J, Section 4 of the Quinumvirate Agreement on Cessation of Hostilities agreement: all parties to the agreement have ceded exclusive salvage rights of vessels of a military nature to their original operating entities<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Curious, as we have not been near the ship in question, but if it is yours, we are happy to allow you full access to it in the spirit of cooperation. As Starfleet personnel, we were mostly concerned with the risk of cultural contamination of the Prime Directive of the local pre-space-flight culture.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The Orb currently on your vessel was taken illegally from the wreckage of a Cardassian military transport, a clear violation of the terms of the agreement.<br />
*Skig blinks.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I am certain that you, upstanding Starfleet officers, did not intend to conduct any illegal salvage. So I am happy to simly take possession of the illegal salvage and we can happily go our separate ways.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Well, that does fill in a few gaps in what we have been able to determine of the native populace.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** I would hate to have to find... alternative resolution, to this dispute.<br />
