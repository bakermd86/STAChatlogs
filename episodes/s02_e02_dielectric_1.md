>Captains Log, Stardate 61924.5: Our survey of the dwarf bodies of the D'Navel system was uneventful, and we are currently en route to our rendezvous with the science vessel USS Maxwel in three daysl to resupply them with long-range survey equipment.

After that resupply, we should have at least a week before we need to be at the geoengineering conference on Tenaxia VI. I have asked the senior staff to go over the data we have and figure out what we should prioritize during that week. I want to make sure we make good use of the time we have available.<br />

>INTERIOR - Conference Room: Murry has wheeled her conspiracy board back out so the crew can decide what their next priority should be.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Okay, so what leads do we have?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well T'Kor has those coordinates that the Twins were communicating with<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I finished launching the Diplomatic Suites debris into the star the Dwarf bodies were orbiting. It turns out all those plastic planters, tacky decor, motivational posters, and decorative chairs were disguising some really good research equipment.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** We also have this datapad that the Twins gave us from the Cardassian Embassy<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Does that have a DB-9 serial port?<br />
*Skig looks at the datapad.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Didn't the Trill give us a lead where the old Lieutenant guy was going?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Anchovy Pizza or something.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** No wait... Antin IV.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Yeah, looks like that is a planet in T'Zenkethi space, near the Romulan border<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** The coordinates from T'Kor are on a Federation planet, Ariadne Opan III<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Likely it is easier to find T'Kor's coordinates than a well trained Federation operative who is on an unknown operation.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** While finding the needle in a haystack, so to speak, is always fun, heading to the coordinates we know is an easier option.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Are these...protein spectrograms?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** They look like wark signatures<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** That would be testable by referencing the names against ship registries.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I know a couple of these names, the Telek and Roral are Keldon class Cardassian heavy cruisers<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Why would the Twins send us a bunch of Cardassian warp signature spectra?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, the Cardassians were being cryptically threatening....but that's hard to differentiate from baseline.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** There was a Cardassian at the gun exchange as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I suspect they may have a similar espionage issue as we do<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Oh wait, I almost forgot after all the chaos at Starfleet Medical... <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Tracking and filtering out warp signatures for a select group of ships is a way to get  them through security checkpoints. Or faking them through a security checkpoint when they are not there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** I do have the warp signature from the black hole that I had been working on. The base signature was fake, but the secondary and tertiary harmonics matched a Cardassian warp signature<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh, that's interesting. One of these?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The Roral perhaps, which Malat told us is a Keldon Class Heavy Cruiser<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well add that to list, we can go track down these Cardassians<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** So what do we tell the Captain? Antin IV, Ariadne Opan III, or track down the Roral?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I sort of want to beat up Sam.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** He clearly knows too much!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I don't think we'd catch him<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Aside that, what do we do if we catch him? He's a Star Fleet officer<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Invite him to a ball!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Officers LOVE big awards and shiny events<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Ariadne Opan III is the one most likely to succeed and least likely to cause a major diplomatic incident.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** He reports directly to the Chief of Staff of Starfleet, I don't think we can nap him and throw him in the brig<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** I think it would be pretty fun to try though<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Also, I am not sure I want to run the risk of the Lister getting into combat with a Cardassian Heavy Cruiser.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Well, given how labrinthine this is, Ariadne is the best place to go.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Ariadne it is then<br />
>Suddenly, Captain Bachar's voice pops in through the comms<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Senior staff report to the bridge, we have a situation<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Wheee!<br />
*Skig duitfully heads to the bridge, happy that when the captain states "situation" it does not mean, "the replicator gave me orange juice and I asked for grapefuit juice".*<br />
>INTERIOR - Bridge: As the senior staff depart the turbolift, Bachar and Windbloom call them over from the aft comms station where they are both looking at a display<br />

*Skig heads over to see what is going on.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** We are picking up a faint distress call from the Omarian cluster<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Very weak, looks like it's probably like... an emergency beacon<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** No details on the situation, but we should probably check it out<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Are the shields modulated according the posted frequencies?<br />
*Skig gets out convenient starmap to see if that is in the direction we want to go in or not.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Right away sir.<br />
*Skig reconsiders the Advanced Research Labs for the Sensor Suites, but it is too late now.*<br />
*Skig configures the Modular Laboratories for biological research.*<br />
>Ghex brings the Lister around to intercept, and soon the vessel comes into view. It looks like an Etaxian crude ore carrier, some signs of battle damage but nothing too extreme.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yeah probably, why not store them in the buffer and make sure this isn't some sort of trojan-ship thing.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/T'kor.png" alt="T'kor" width="50" height="50">**T'kor** That would be me, yes. What happened?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** It was the strangest thing. We were attacked, so we surrendered assuming they would take our load of dilithium ore<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** But instead, they just came over and started pulling out all of the wiring from our power grid<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** They stripped away all of the wire insulating and took it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Krepeka.png" alt="Krepeka" width="50" height="50">**Krepeka** Did you consider ramming them at warp speed prior to surrender?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** They didn't seem to have any interest in the dilithium at all<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Are there any injured who require immediate attention? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** No, we are mostly ok it is just our power grid that is damaged<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** They only fired one shot before we surrendered. This is a bulk ore carrier, we are no match for a Klingon cruiser, even one as old as a D7<br />

<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** Ethically sourced? I don't understand<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** It is Dilthium, from asteroids<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** I don't think they ask the asteroids how they feel about it<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** No dubious destruction of ecosystems, no forced labor, ya know, the sort of things to muddy the waters?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** very well then!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** I don't know, we only just started working here.<br />

*Krepeka looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** You are a very scary looking creature though, I am sure you can handle those Pakleds<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Krepeka.png" alt="Krepeka" width="50" height="50">**Krepeka** With all due respect sir, I am certain that the dilithium is likely harvested remnants of crystallized dinosaur bones scattered across the cosmos. After all, it all comes back to humans needing oil, right?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/ermatan.jpeg" alt="Ermatan" width="50" height="50">**Ermatan** I do not know many humans, I cannot speak to their needs<br />
*Krepeka sighs that a species whose sole claim to fame is having opposable thumbs that are too large to be used to remove nostil debris.*<br />
*Krepeka looks at Zox.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Krepeka.png" alt="Krepeka" width="50" height="50">**Krepeka** Could you possibly scan and gather the sensor logs to determine the emissions pattern and warp signature of the vessel to track it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Already on it!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** We have a lead on it<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** We should look into it. These Pakleds sound like a problem we should deal with.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** It'd give us some good quality assurance for the current repairs done, just to make sure they'd perform under real combat rather than a turkey shoot.<br />

>Zox reads a matching warp signature a few light years away and sends the coordinates to Ghex. As the Lister approaches, they can read an old Klingon battle cruiser of a similar vintage to the Lister.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** I wonder if the Lister and that old cruiser ever like... tangled in the past. It really makes you wonder about the unknowable vastness of history, you know?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Yes. Notwithstanding the unknowable vastness of history, lets go to yellow alert and hail them. <br />
*Skig pushes the "scary yellow button" and raises shields.*<br />
*Zox considers spoiling the profundity of the moment with electronic records, then takes a hit on a blunt before passing it to Windbloom*<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** No, that sounds like not a good idea. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Other Pakled don't look like food<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Food looks like this<br />
*Captain Kaglor wanders off screen for a moment before returning with some sort of noodle dish in a bowl*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** This does not look like Pakleds<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** I have need of valid food sources, I understand you have need of dialectric material. Perhaps we trade?<br />
