>INTERIOR - Torpedo: Zox hears the hum of electricity and the hiss of hot plasma vibrating through the shell of the torpedo as he streaks through the miasma in the direction of his quarry. When the torpedo finally impacts into a solid surface, the front hatch pops off, Zox's exo-suit sprays him down with hot cooking grease, and he slides effortlessly out onto the deck.<br />

>As he looks around, he sees a corridor in dissarray. The floor is bare metal, no carpeting has been installed. Many wall panels are missing, most of the lights are out apart from the emergency lighting. The corridor is eerily silent, no sound other than the hum of the warp engines can be heard. <br />

When I was at the academy, I did the density tensor calculations on warp impediments in Navigation and Warp Operations Theory. At these densities, the ship would be atomized if we tried to jump to warp.<br />

That is probably why he spends so much time in sickbay. I heard from some of the enlisted personel that they thought Zox was having a secret love affair with you ma'am, because of how often he goes to sickbay. But I told them that wasn't likely, because I think Zox's species is asexual or something. Also he is just an idiot/<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Thank you, Lieutenant<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk thinks that Orb was actually a passenger, as it is a conduit to a sentient entity that makes it not count as salvage. Also, if you hold it upside down and shake it, fry oil drips out.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Might want to approach argument as it is a sentient passenger, otherwise tasty looking Cardassian will counter it is a communication device.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Yes! If it can talk, if it can express things, even if it is just a projection of an extra-planar being beyond the rules of science, it is sentient. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Also, let me know when to spray Cardassian with Sriracha sauce.<br />
*Throk gets out a large container of Sriracha and sets it on the table in front of them.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I'm sorry what was that last bit? Is there oil leaking out of it?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** Sirracha is considered a leathal weapon with a Gorn around. You might want to not brandish that here. =D<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** We will now resume the proceedings. Upon review of the relevant data, I believe it is logical to conclude that the Pelarians' potential removal of the orb does not constitute a salvage operation as the vessel was not in danger, nor a navigation hazard, nor a cause of environmental danger.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** Are there any objections to this finding before we proceed.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We posit that this does constitute salvage. The Orb itself actually emits a variety of different exotic particles and effects, not the least of which are some which were the reason we were called here to begin with. It was interfering with the holographic concealers on the research base here. This means the Orb  in particular poses an environmental hazard in that sense, but also in the effects that the visions have upon the culture and society of the Pelarians. The statute specifies that the removal of anything posing an environmental hazard will constitute a recovery operation. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** This is pure speculation. The Pelarians are primitives. They are completely unaware of any potential environmental hazards from the wreckage or the orb. Besides which it is pure speculation to suggest that the orbs constitute an environmental hazard, the Bajorans have been living in proximity to them for thousands of years. There is no evidence that they cause environmental damage.<br />
**Throk: [ CONTROL  (8) +  MEDICINE  (1)]
[Successes: 0] [Complications: 0]
Failed on DC: 1 [2d20 = 31]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** That which poses an environmental risk to a Bajoran and to a Pelarian are not necessarily the same. It is not logical to invoke Bajoran history as evidence of the orb's safety here. And the provisions of the commerce agreement do not include an intent requirement, so it is thus illogical to rely on the Pelarians' knowledge of the potential environmental hazard.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk object as evolution would dictate that Bajorans have been living in proximity with orbs long enough to develop resistance to any harmful effects they emit, while Pelerians would be subjected to any adverse effect due to a deficiency in their genetic makeup which would preclude said resistance. They are different species and the argument made by the Cardassian is moot.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** In light of this argument: I find it is logical to conclude that the Pelarians' removal of objects from the site is sufficient to constitute a salvage operation. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Throk.png" alt="Throk" width="50" height="50">**Throk** Throk makes mental note to invite T'Pau over for dinner.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** In light of this: I find that the position of Commander Murry that the Pelarians have conducted a legitimate salvage operation prior to the enforcement date of the agreement to be logical. <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Throk): (later sad to learn)</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** As such, the provisions of the quinumvirate agreement do not apply, and the standard salvage provisions must then be applied in accordance with the Federated Commerce Agreement.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/t_pau_id.png" alt="T'Pau" width="50" height="50">**T'Pau** The Cardassians retain ownership rights in the salvage, but they must make an appropriate renumeration to the Pelarians to be negotiated between the Pelarians and the Cardassians<br />

*Throk sniffs Sriracha on Darisha-Han and drools on her a little.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** On that topic your honor, I do not believe that any renumeration is due to the Pelarians<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** Under the conditions of the commerce agreement, the Pelarians have a "duty to secure the salvaged property from damage or theft" and "If the salvor has been negligent, they may forfeit the right to claim compensation"<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The Pelarians were very evidently negligent in their duty to protect the salvaged property from theft, as a junior officer aboard this vessel was able to steal it with minimal effort.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Darisha-Han.png" alt="Darisha-Han" width="50" height="50">**Darisha-Han** does the agreement apply to the Pelarians at all, if they have not signed it though? (Looks to Hailey Murry )<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Cardassian.png" alt="Gul Bemek" width="50" height="50">**Gul Bemek** The successful theft of the orb by this officer proves beyond doubt that they were not able to honor their duties under these provisions, so we owe the Pelarians no renumeration for thier incompetent salvage operations.<br />
