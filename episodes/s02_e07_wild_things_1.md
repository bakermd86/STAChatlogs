>Captains Log, Stardate 62263.6: Dozens of high ranking diplomats and other VIPs are arriving today for the conference. I can't say I am filled with confidence. I just hope we don't start another galaxy-wide war.

> I need to make sure we feed Throk before the attendees arrive. And configure the internal sensors to alert me if he attempts to replicate any sriracha. And maybe staple Zox's uniform onto his body. What was I thinking when I approved this conference...<br />

>INTERIOR - Transporter Room 2: Captain Bachar and the other senior officers are gathered in their dress uniforms to welcome the VIPs attending the conference. Captain Bachar checks the internal sensors on a wall panel and sees that Throk is currently helping Captain Kaglor set up for his speech, and has not yet eaten anyone.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** I'd like everyone to be on their best behavior during the conference. No stealing, no kidnapping, don't cause any wars.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Yes Ma'am!<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Where food is plentiful, there is no conflict. Such is the way of the Voth herds. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Malat, this means that in conflict resolution, you cannot punch the Cardassians <br />
*Zox begins wootling the wootle of harvests and spring.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I have confdience the crew will act in accordance with the precepts of Starfleet and do nothing rash or untoward.<br />
*Skig flips over note to see if there is anything on the back she is supposed to read.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/windbloom_openheart.png" alt="Windbloom Openheart" width="50" height="50">**Windbloom Openheart** Yeah, totally. I put ketamine in the punch anyways. Everyone will be super chill<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Was that the large bowl of stuff that I saw the Pakleds taking snorts of?<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): "We need a new mysterious enemy"</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Bachar to crew lounge, someone replicate new punch. And scan all of the other food for drugs.<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): The Star Wars Trade Federation?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Our guests are arriving, let's try to put our best foot forward. <br />
**Skig:  [d20 = 19]**<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): too on the nose, Breen are easier to script =D</font><br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Wait.. Daleks from Doctor Who?</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Drugs are Windblooms best though. Have you tried them?<br />
>The transporter activates and a Klingon woman materializes on the pad and glares at the crew for a moment before stepping down.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/korana.png" alt="Korana, daughter of Ganath" width="50" height="50">**Korana, daughter of Ganath** I am Korana, daughter of Ganath, Junior Deputy Chief of Mission to the Federation. <br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Wait.. Ko-Dan Empire! That's who we need for an enemy.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/korana.png" alt="Korana, daughter of Ganath" width="50" height="50">**Korana, daughter of Ganath** I am... honored to be invited to such a... noble endeavor<br />
*Korana, daughter of Ganath spits the words out in a way that makes it clear she is not at all honored to be here*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** We are honored you accepted our invitation and have graced us with your presence for this august intercultural event.<br />
*Skig checks next note card she received from Kolea.*<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): just drop the cards along as she goes, zero subtlety. </font><br />
*Korana, daughter of Ganath walks out of the room without saying another word.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Malat.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Malat" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Malat** Well, she seems pretty friendly<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Don't worry, Fen's not the only one with a table... I came up with a table for the cards and getting them out of order.</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Hopefully she finds it a bit enjoyable, but not too much<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** This is absolutely perfect. More angry and indifferent guests give us the ideal scenario to test our cooking and turn those frowns, around! BAM!<br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d20 = 8]**<br />
>The pad energizes again a few moments later, and a pair of Romulans (a young woman and an older man) materialize on the pad.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Do you want to try some Targ, but no one knows how to marinate that beast? Well today do we have a treat for you!<br />
*Skig looks through a few cards to see if she has a written response to Zox's comments.*<br />
>The older man walks down from the pad and smiles at the crew.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/sorak.png" alt="Senator Sorak" width="50" height="50">**Senator Sorak** Warm greetings my friends. I am Senator Sorak, this young woman is Proconsul Vrell. On behalf of the Romulan Empire, I thank you for taking the initiative to host this event and include us in it.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/sorak.png" alt="Senator Sorak" width="50" height="50">**Senator Sorak** I look forward to seeing how this... unique array of speakers pans out.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vrell.png" alt="Proconsul Vrell" width="50" height="50">**Proconsul Vrell** "Unique" is certainly a word for it. The Federation must really be running out of thought leaders if you are allowing a Pakled to speak at your conference<br />
<img src="../images/auto/vrell.png" alt="Proconsul Vrell" width="50" height="50">**Proconsul Vrell** What happened, did the zoo run out of trained monkeys?<br />
*Proconsul Vrell laughs and walks out of the room.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Thank you Senator and Proconsul Vrell for joining us and taking part in the opportunity to explore our shared interests in interstellar cooperation.<br />
*Skig flips note over.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/sorak.png" alt="Senator Sorak" width="50" height="50">**Senator Sorak** You will have to forgive her, she lacks decorum but she is highly knowledgable<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I know the type.<br />
*Zox ponders if there are even zoos in the enlightened 24th century, or if they have been found to be unethical...*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Starfleet is very tolerant, so apologies are not necessary but apprecated. Thank you again Senator.<br />
*Skig flips to the next card.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/sorak.png" alt="Senator Sorak" width="50" height="50">**Senator Sorak** I will ask the computer where my quarters are located and go deposit my things. I look forward to seeing you all shortly in the lounge for the meet and greet.<br />
*Senator Sorak bows respectfully before leaving*<br />
*Skig wonders how Kolea knew that Vrell would start that well.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Wow these guests are just like todays dishes! some savory, some spicy!<br />
>The pad energizes again, and pair of Cardassian men materialize on the pad. One wearing a military dress uniform, covered in medals and honors. The other wearing a simple brown shirt and courderoy pants.<br />

*Gul Haloras walks up to the crew and looks them in the eyes*<br />
*Skig is too busy sorting through her cards to look back at his eyes.*<br />
*Zox 's reptilian eyes never seem to blink*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Thank you for coming to the USS Lister. We appreciate you taking time from your busy schedules...<br />
**Gul Haloras** Greetings. I will refrain from introductions, you know who I am.<br />

Failed on DC: 1 [2d20 = 32]**<br />
**Gul Haloras** My schedule actually was quite free this week. My ship is in drydock undergoing some repairs.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** ...and look forward to having dinner with you?<br />
**Gul Haloras** It will be a pleasant diversion.<br />
*Skig looks at cards again.*<br />
*Gul Haloras makes no facial expressions of any kind to indicate his pleasure*<br />
*Skig wonders if his ship has recently shot itself.*<br />
**Gul Haloras** I will retire to my quarters.<br />
**Hailey Murry: [ INSIGHT  (13) +  MEDICINE  (4)]
[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]

<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): "A bunch of deranged federation ruined my capital ship"</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** My, what a pleasant man. If you enjoyed his presence in these last few moments, imagine how much I enjoyed it during the six hour trip on the transport.<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): "It survived 9 battles in the Dominion war just to lose to space garbage"</font><br />
*Skig flips over a card.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** Elim Garak, Cardassian Ambassador to the Klingon Empire. But I am not overly fond of titles, so just think of me as plain, simple Garak.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I am certain your travel hardships are small compared to the difficulties that come of exhaustive diplomacy to achieve any semblance of progress given your posting.<br />
*Skig wonders if Kolea was reading up on who these people were and taking notes.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** Oh you have no idea the difficulties. Have you ever lived on Qonos? Klingons don't like to eat things that are already dead, they think it isn't fresh.<br />
*Skig flips through a few cards.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** At least the program for this event included cooked meats.<br />
**Skig: [ PRESENCE  (8) +  ENGINEERING  (5)]

[Successes: 1] [Complications: 0]
Success with 0 momentum [2d20 = 24]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** I would recommend keepinmg an eye on Gul Haloras during the drinks gathering though. He has a bit of a reputation on Cardassia as an angry drunk.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I would recommend avoiding the Throk-related events for your best culinary experience. Also, don't hold a bottle of sriracha, no matter what anyone tells you.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** I will take that under advisement.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Have we got a treat for you! All the cultures and cuisines that exist, and more, to refresh your pallette! <br />
*Skig flips through some other cards.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** Oh I have no doubt that this will be an exciting event. I would expect no less.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/garak.png" alt="Ambassador Garak" width="50" height="50">**Ambassador Garak** Until this evening.<br />
*Ambassador Garak nods politely.*<br />
*Skig tugs at her collar after Garak walks away.*<br />
*Skig looks at Bachar.*<br />
**Zox: [ CONTROL  (11) +  SECURITY  (5)]

[Successes: 4] [Complications: 0]
Success with 3 momentum [2d20 = 4]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** These cards from Kolea were really helpful. I have no idea when she had time to write them all out and do all this research.<br />
*Zox innocently pushes buttons on a padd. Just doin 'Ops things.*<br />
**Zox:  [d20 = 17]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Kolea to Captain Bachar, Captain, can you and the command staff come to sickbay, we have a medical situation that needs command attention.<br />
*Skig checks chronometer.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Less than 10 minutes to the first medical emergency...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Oh our way.<br />
>Bachar, Skig, Zox and Murry head to the turbolift and take it down to Sickbary. When they arrive, they see Kolea standing by the door to her office, inside a woman wearing black civilian clothes is leaning against her desk<br />

<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** So I hear you may have found a substitute for this<br />
*Trill Female holds up a hypospray*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I am due for a shot, time to find out whether you were worth the trust.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Hopefully, yes. I see the 4 Latinum I sent from the Orphanage made it.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I got the message, took a little while to make my way back here<br />
*Trill Female rolls up her sleeve and holds out her arm.*<br />
*Kolea gets hypospray ready and really hopes this works properly.*<br />
*Zox realizes that he has no control over who gets on the ship or off the ship, and that talking to Malat will do nothing about this.*<br />
**Kolea: [ REASON  (9) +  MEDICINE  (4)]

Success with 2 momentum [2d20 = 7]**<br />
>Kolea administers the shot, and the Trill stands up and flexes her arm as she rolls her sleeve down.<br />

*Trill Female takes a deep breath and nods*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I was half expecting that to kill me<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Ok, I'll keep my end of the deal.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** I had been trying to track down your doctor, but by the time I found the body he had been in, they had already swapped him out<br />
*Kolea wonders if ANYONE ever looks at the transporter logs or if ANYONE might think to post trusted guards in transporter rooms.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Oh, also I need to give you this<br />
*Trill Female hands a padd to Kolea.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Well, the effort is certainly appreciated<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Trill Female" width="50" height="50">**Trill Female** Tavanliklan Koris has a lot of food alergies, I need to give you his dietary restrictions<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Thanks.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** For both of those.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** And here...<br />
*Kolea hands her the serum replication information so she can make it herself.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I'm here in an official capacity: Shaya Antin: Junior something something to Tavaniklan Koris<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Show me your best americano<br />
*Skig does not believe her and hands her a PADD to see if she can carry it according to her dossier.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** We have something a little more important to discuss: once I tracked down the Vulcan woman's body, I found something pretty disturbing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** She has a lab, near Tholian space, where she is researching a bioweapon<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** If you mean the Vulcan woman in question I think you are talking about, there is very little *not disturbing* about her.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I don't know the details, but I know that this absolute psychopath needs to be stopped<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** That's more disturbing than normal, though<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Only a truly deranged individual would create such a horrible character from a random red-shirt roll that she turns into one of the primary villains... oh wait...</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I can give you the coordinates, but I don't know how long she'll be there. If you want to be sure to get her, you should leave right away.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I would go with you, but I need to stay here to maintain my cover with Sam. <br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** But if we leave now the food will be cold when we get back?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I think this is perhaps slightly more important that the temperature of the food<br />
*Skig checks notes from Kolea to see if, "Maximum Warp to Tholian Space with the Lister and kidnapping all the delegates" is in the cards?*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** You have 2 shapeshifters on this crew, they can fill in for anyone that you need to be absent<br />
<font color="#005500">Masakari (Zox): 'Throk go to your room!'</font><br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I'm not sure one of our shape shifters can convincingly play a bit. I think you've met her. Shes' a bit...flighty. =D<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** Don't remind me...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Can you give her a lesson or two? I'd really hate it if she had to...wing it.<br />
*Zox tries to keep a straight face*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I could kill you right now<br />

*Kolea gets out bingo card.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** No, don't kill him. But if you perforate his left lung I will get a double bingo.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** Although, on that topic: I should warn you that Sam gave me a couple of missions to take care of during this conference<br />
*Kolea hands a bingo card to Shaya Antin.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** He has not had any eyes on the Lister for a while, so he wants me to bug the briefing room, bridge and main engineering<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** Leave them there for a few weeks before you discover them, or he will suspect I betrayed him<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** The second task is a little more sensitive....<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Sure, let me know where they are and I will let him enjoy very banal conversation and then dispose of them one at a time over the course of a week at random intervals.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I need to make it look good, if it doesn't look like a real effort Sam will know something is up.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** That would have torpedoed any chance of using this room.<br />
*Kolea gets out a large box from a replicator and opens several hatches to take out things that are immediately covered by large CENSOR signs.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Kolea.png" alt="Kolea" width="50" height="50">**Kolea** Oh, and that smudge on the ceiling, yeah, don't look up.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** It is weird though, he had called off the attempts to kill Rhuk a long time ago. She had already told you everything she knew<br />

<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** I was planning something more like an accidental spacing, electrocution, overload, something heavy falling on them.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/TrillFemale.png" alt="Shaya Antin" width="50" height="50">**Shaya Antin** A death that would not seem out of place in the Lister's logs<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Oh electrocution would be incredibly easy, I think Kaglor probably has something planned for that<br />

>INTERIOR - Lounge: As the crew and attendees walk in, they hear a faint squeking sound beneath their feet and notice that the entire floor has been lined with a thick rubberized mat. The chairs are all also made of high-breakdown dielectric materials. On stage, Captain Kaglor and several of the Pakleds are standing in front of a giant drop cloth covering up something that he has place on the stage, and which is connected to several high-voltage EPS lines.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** I asked Captain Bachar how to be convincing, and she told me that it can often help to use a metal four<br />

<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** Now, my metal four is very powerful: 15kilovolts at 1250 Mhz<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** I do not understand why a metal four is important, but understand is not required for doing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/pakled.png" alt="Captain Kaglor" width="50" height="50">**Captain Kaglor** This metal four represents threats that are too strong for any of you to face on your own: the dominion, the borg, bears<br />
