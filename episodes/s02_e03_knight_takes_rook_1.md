>Captains Log, Stardate 61992.4: Our resupply of the USS Maxwel went smoothly, so we are taking advantage of the free time to divert to Ariadne Opan III to investigate the coordinates T'Kor tracked from the Twins' communications. We have no idea what we'll find there, and we still have 30 Pakleds living in the Cargo bay. I suppose this is just the routine now on this ship. At least Zox hasn't lost his pants for a while, I'll count that as a victory<br />

>EXTERIOR - Bridge: The crew are at their stations as the Lister enters the Ariadne Opan system, Captain Bachar is bouncing her leg as she regards the sensor feed on her armrest display.<br />

>As the Lister enters orbit, you can see the roiling white and blue clouds of Ariadne Opan III. Hot crackles of ionic lightning are visible even from orbit, and the surface is completely occluded by the thick ion storms blanketing the planet's upper ionosphere.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** No doubt why these coordinates were picked<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** This system was last surveyed in the late 23rd century and is considered "boring" and while this planet is "habitable" the ionic radiation precludes any permanent settlement. It is far from any regional borders. Or, as was one said about a planet, "If there is a bright center of the universe, this is the place that it is farthest from".<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Interesting, this looks like it could be a navigational deflector. No starship, because there's no warp signature, but just the deflector itself<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Perhaps a dome or the like?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Yeah, no one would take a starship into that soup. That much ionic interference would wreak havoc on the EPS network, probably overload the entire power grid. Something similar happened to me during training when we were learning to navigate transports in the ionic storms on Jupiter<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** If it is remaining stationary in this atmospheric condition, that would be a good question of "how" from an engineering standpoint.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** It seems like it's got a cable attached to it, to lower something down there<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Skig is right, it must be actively station keeping in order to remain at that altitude<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Viraseti.png" alt="Lt. Cmdr Viraseti" width="50" height="50">**Lt. Cmdr Viraseti** Otherwise it would just fall back to the surface<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Bachar.png" alt="Captain Bachar" width="50" height="50">**Captain Bachar** Far too risky<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** We could try the same sort of trick they have, lowering something down toward them. How close can we get?<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** Well: if we calculate the discharge voltage of the ionosphere based on the length of the arcs, and then based on the sensor reading of the atmospheric dimensions... You know, when we did ionic interference training on Jupiter, they made us do these calculations for the training craft, even though Jupiters ionosphere is so well studied you can just look up the parameters in the computer. I know that some of the students just looked up the parameters the day before so they didn't even really have to do the calculations, they just already knew what the safe altitude limit was.... 81km <br />
**Hailey Murry:  [d20 = 9]**<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Is that 81km for this ship or Jupiter's?<br />
*Ensign Ghex giggles*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** There is some signal going up and down a cable....so that thing is probably some sort of antennae...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Ghex.png" alt="Ensign Ghex" width="50" height="50">**Ensign Ghex** This planet, of course. 81km would be INSIDE Jupter's atmosphere ma'am. That would be so dangerous, you would never do that with a starship the size of the Lister<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Is the antenna transmitting into space, or just between the object we are detecting and some unknown ground station?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Nothing right now, but this does seem like a great set up to not get found...<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Also, before anyone thinks of it, Old Faithless is rated for ionic dispersal missions providing the pilot is okay wearing 3cm of dialetric material over their entire body as the pilot's seat is the ground point for all ionic radiation that gets converted by the shield capacitance inverters into raw electricity.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I'm not recommending we do that, just that I was bored and had some spare time a couple years ago and wondered if that was feasible.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** I wonder if it is feasilbe to modulate our shields to counter act the ions here....<br />

**Lt. Cmdr Malat (muttering)** Good thing I'm not the conn officer anymore<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** Test flights also showed that venting the atmosphere on Old Faithful reduced the number of fatalities among Red Shirts by 76%.<br />
*Skig wonders why it is so hard to find volunteers for her engineering projects these days.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Skig; if we use a modulated capactiance pattern on Old Faithful, we should be able to navigate the storms without creating a large, hazardous differential. Thoughts?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** Only a small vessel can do this, a large one would surely build a differential and subsequent discharge.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** The smaller size and capacity of the shuttle would definitely handle this... but...<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Would it be possible to just beam down to the transmitter? Are we able to get any useful data that would show a control room or transmitter?</font><br />

<img src="../images/auto/Skig.png" alt="Skig" width="50" height="50">**Skig** I think we should start with a probe to determine what we are contending with and if there is a place we could land at - or beam down to - that would precipitate a better decision making process than watching the pretty lightning.<br />

<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** As for the investigation, every element of the Starfleet security and intelligence apparatus has been investigating the failed assassination of the president.

<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** As it happens, the "suspect" was a friend of theirs, and another former crewmate of mine: Ensign Kenneth Dalby. <br />

<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Hundreds of officers, not the Twins if that is what you're getting at. They were working at Utopia Planitia on Mars though, pretty much next door<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** I was wondering who else on the Voyager, in particular. If not yourself? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** As far as I know, none of my other former crew were assigned there.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Do you know what team they were on?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Celes is a sensor analyst, so she reviews, categorizes and analyzes sensor data. Dalby was a security officer.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** But I became convinced that the entire security apparatus was barking up the wrong tree. Celes and Dalby were the targets, not the president<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** To hide what?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Now that is a dangerous question. And when I started asking it, a bomb found its way into my shuttle as well<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Fortunately, the Flyer is a little harder to blow up than an atmospheric transport. A little Borg technology goes a long way in improving your autonomous system security<br />

<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** They want to make the Federation blind so a surprise attack can trigger..or reignite a war.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Zox.png" alt="Zox" width="50" height="50">**Zox** And there's at least one crooked admiral in on this.<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** But what would've been spotted in a little outpost on Jupiter? <br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Whatever it was, it was important enough that someone faked an assassination of the president in order to get rid of them<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** All the Bynars were able to find was the coordinates of the signal they were analyzing<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Nothing on its contents<br />
*Zox 's ears would pop up...if he had any.*<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** Which coordinates?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** The coordinates were a nondescript star system near the three-way border between Romulan, Klingon and Federation space. They seemed unimportant to 11 and 10. But I happened to know that a highly classified diplomatic conference was taking place there. Negotiations between the Federaion, Romluans, Klingons and Cardassians for a new joint treaty and defense agreement<br />
<img src="../images/auto/Hailey_Murry.png" alt="Hailey Murry" width="50" height="50">**Hailey Murry** When?<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** The meetings have been ongoing for over a year, and they are still in progress. Negotiations have been difficult because the Romulans are still supicious of Federation motivation, the Klingons want to continue to force the Cardassians to pay reparations for war deaths, and the Cardassians want security assurances in the event of another Dominion incursion... Typical diplomacy<br />
<img src="../images/auto/janeway.png" alt="Admiral Janeway" width="50" height="50">**Admiral Janeway** Your doctor, the one who betrayed you: did you ever figure out who he was in contact with?<br />
