>Captain's Log, Stardate 61165.8: Due to extensive, unexplained hull breaches on deck 8 after the Lister's infestation, we have had to divert to the nearest Federation dry-dock facility on Skana-IV to repair the damage.
While the repairs are performed, I have ordered the crew to take some shore leave in the planet's equatorial area.
Most of the crew were happy for the time off, but Commander Skig was... shall we say passionate about overseeing the repairs. I asked Zox to keep an eye on her and make sure she doesn't sneak back onto the Lister to work during her leave.<br />

>INTERIOR - Madau Casino: Zox, Skig and Murry have gone to the casino with Zerra and the twins. Dr. Zerra read some book on Dabo and is convinced he has a perfect system to beat the house. The twins have accompanied him, as they are convinced he does not.<br />

![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I'm telling you, with the right betting strategy Dabo is actually a very simple game. You two are going to eat your words.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** We do not question that Dabo is a simple game. So simple in fact that we can prove quite easily that the house has a 7% advantage, regardless of your "strategy"<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Well, maybe not regardless of the strategy<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** But you've got to be very careful about that<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Correct, you can always give the house a greater advantage<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I hope you lose early and consolidate your loss, otherwise you may confuse luck for skill.<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** Ye of little faith<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** You are correct, we have no faith to speak of<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Oh, sorry, what were we discussing?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Nothing quite breaks the mind better than arriving at something for the wrong reasons.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Gamblin!<br />
*Dr. Zerra places several bets on the Dabo table*<br />
*Skig tries to surrepitiously hide her tricoder's auto-relay of from the Lister's repair terminal.*<br />
*Skig whistles in a very, "I'm guilty and can't even fake hiding it" way.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Do you find this form of recreation enjoyable Commander?<br />
*Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10 speaking to Zox*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Aww, I understand you Skig. But if you want to have some fun with engineering, watch this poor Dr. break a mental circuit. It could be fun!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Dr Zerra, where did you get the funds for this?<br />
**Dabo Girl:** Last call, all bets are final!<br />
*Dabo Girl spins the Dabo wheel*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It brings out the worst in people I think, but I can't speak for all sentient being in what make them tick.<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** They say the only winning move is not to play, but I'm finding this is very entertaining<br />
>Zox has chosen poorly<br />

*Skig makes mental note to never trust Zox or Zerra with money.*<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** It is truly astonishing how quickly you both lost your money<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I knew I should have listened to that Ferengi selling timeshares....that would have been a good investment.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** It's better this way. <br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What could have happend?!<br />
<font color="#005500">indarien (Skig): Does the room look trashed?</font><br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Skig, im sure these rooms have a lot of 'Action' going on in them, can you hack into the camera feed?<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Possibly run a scan to see how much transporter activity has occured in this space?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Hmm... I wonder if this part of some strange human mating ritual, like Hailey did recently?<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** This is Lt. Commander Skig of the USS Lister to casino security. I need access to the level 14 security system relays for the last 30 minutes.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** As well as all video surveillance footage of the elevators to and from level 14 for the past 30 minutes.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Dr. Zerra, could you canvas the area for any residual nucleic acid residues?<br />
**Nameless, faceless security guard:** Uhhm, sure thing ma'am. Are we in trouble?<br />

*Hailey Murry stands by the bed, frowning*<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** That depends on what we find. We are investigating a disturbance with crewmember.<br />
**Nameless, faceless security guard:** Oh, ok. It's my first day, so I don't want to get fired again<br />
>Skig receives a link to her PADD containing surveilance footage from level 14<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** What's the matter Hailey, insufficient human mating activity?<br />
>Hailey Murry kneels down to investigate a black score mark on the deck near the bed. It is approximately 1/2 meter across, and smells slightly of burnt hair<br />

![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** What could have cuased this?<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** I am reading humanoid DNA here. It looks like someone was vaporized here with a disruptor...<br />

Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 29]**<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** The DNA is damaged beyond recognition, even with the scanners in sickbay I wouldn't be able to identify it<br />
![](../images/zerra.png)**Dr. Zerra:** It could be Human, but it could also be one of a dozen other species<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Damn this 24th Century technology!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Most DNA evidence turned out to be faulty in Tellerite judicial court, so I'm not sure how useful it would be.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Now we will be agonized if Bachar vaped someone while being abucted, or was herself vaped!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** I doubt Bachar was carrying a disrupter, likely it was one of the Naussicans who broke into her room after they beamed into the hallway.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Naussicans? <br />
*Skig states this while contemplating the decorative vase on the table.*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** What is it with Naussicans and gambling related violence.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Normally I would assume Bachar is carrying a disruptor, but given that she is on shore leave, I would suspect only a type-2 phaser instead.<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There was also an Orion woman with them, which was likely the leader of the group, given Orion control of various syndicates.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** But is Bachar OK!?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** The footage is inconclusive, as it does not include interior room events.<br />

[Successes: 2] [Complications: 0]
Success with 1 momentum [2d20 = 14]**<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Is there any way you can have the Lister prevent any ships from leaving orbit?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Also, there is a 132.87263 second gap in the footage, which means the security system here is compromised, and whoever has done it is likely listening to our conversation.<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** The lister is in dry dock, it couldn't prevent a shuttle from leaving orbit<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** We'll want to talk to the Captain, I think. He may have some clues about her previous postings<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** The Lister is bowed but never unready!<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Well, there is a captain of a Federation starship, who could request immediate ship-lock of port control.<br />
*Zox Slaps his in communicator badge in a forceful yet dignified fashion*<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Captain Baras, requesting a cessation of all outgoing orbital traffic immediately!<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** 11, 10, can you do a trace on the transporter? Skig, can you point out where the Orion Woman and Naussicans transported in at?<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** Oh my stars, I'll call it in as soon as I find my pants<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** But I'll need an explanation after my massage<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Yes Captain!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Interesting, the transporter trace does not appear to be leaving the surface. It reads as a point-to-point transport to another continent north of here<br />
**Kolea:** But Captain, are you sure you want me to stop what I'm currently doing and let you get your pants back?<br />

>Zox investigates the computer hack and manages to pull up some of the deleted footage from the hall. He plays it back on the monitor<br />

>Commander Bachar's door is already open, and the sounds of a struggle can be heard inside<br />

![](../images/bachar.png)**Commander Bachar:** Bachar to Zox! I need a full...<br />
*Skig uses the electronic slot machines as a distributed point relay to create an infinite loop for outbound traffic on any identified suspicious traffic.*<br />

**Unidentified Male:** Uhhh, I forgot. Am I in trouble?<br />
**Unidentified Female:** Just beam down to security and delete the footage before these starfleet types find it<br />
**Unidentified Female:** You, dissintigrate the body<br />

**Kolea:** Oooh!!  I love it when I get anal konis!<br />
>Two transporter sounds are then heard, one from inside the room and one from the hall as the away team beam in. The recording ends shortly after<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There goes our ratings for this week.<br />
>ANTAL Konis<br />

**Kolea:** Captain, would you like some anal kontis?<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** Please stop.<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Kolea, we WILL reinstall the censors if you keep that up<br />
![](../images/baras.png)**Captain Baras:** I could fire you, you know<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** Someone pinpoint that location and lets pursue!<br />
*Kolea says something which is heavily bleeped, even on Cinemax at 0200.*<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** So, I think it's pretty safe to say that Bachar is okay. They would have vaporized her to being with if they'd wanted to kill her and get ird of the body<br />
*Zox 's scales flush from red to blue to purple*<br />

![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** To Antal Konis!<br />
![](../images/twins.png)**Lt. Cmdrs 11 and 10:** Apologies Commander, but I am not able to pinpoint the transporter trace to a specific location. I can narrow it down to a city on the northern continent though<br />
*Kolea looks up information on hotels/restaurants/locations named Antal Konis. Failing that, looks for any regsitered guests who have arrived through arrival starports.*<br />

>Skig finds a variety of information on an Aldazed chemist named Antal Konis. There are a variety of things bearing his name in the city: A Memorial, a public library, a Federation Chemistry lab, a museum, and a public park<br />

![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** There are a number of locations dedicated to the chemist Antal Konis, unless the people in question were planning to hang out in a public meeting room in a library none of them would require reservations.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** HRM<br />
![](../images/murry.png)**Hailey Murry:** Is the Chemist still alive? <br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** However, we should be able to investigate them rather easily to determine where our Naussican quarry went.<br />
![](../images/skig.png)**Skig:** No, but he is the only person who is followed by Neraran's Twitter account.<br />
![](../images/zox.png)**Zox:** I wonder what a bunch of bad people would want with a Federation Commander....Computer, what is the most secure location in Antal Konis that a commander would be needed to grant access?<br />
